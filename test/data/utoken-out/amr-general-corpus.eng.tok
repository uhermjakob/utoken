A form of asbestos once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago , researchers reported .
The asbestos fiber , crocidolite , is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs , with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later , researchers said .
Lorillard Inc. , the unit of New York - based Loews Corp. that makes Kent cigarettes , stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956 .
Although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago , the latest results appear in today 's New England Journal of Medicine , a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem .
A Lorillard spokewoman said , `` This is an old story .
We 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties .
There is no asbestos in our products now . ''
Neither Lorillard nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes .
`` We have no useful information on whether users are at risk , '' said James A. Talcott of Boston 's Dana - Farber Cancer Institute .
Dr. Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University .
The Lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in `` very modest amounts '' in making paper for the filters in the early 1950 s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956 .
From 1953 to 1955 , 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold , the company said .
Among 33 men who worked closely with the substance , 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number .
Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos - related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer .
The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected , the researchers said .
`` The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos - related diseases , '' said Dr. Talcott .
The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton , Mass. , paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in Western industrialized countries , he said .
The plant , which is owned by Hollingsworth & Vose Co. , was under contract with Lorillard to make the cigarette filters .
The finding probably will support those who argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , found in most schools and other buildings , Dr. Talcott said .
The U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , needle - like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles , according to Brooke T. Mossman , a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine .
More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body , Dr. Mossman explained .
In July , the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos .
By 1997 , almost all remaining uses of cancer - causing asbestos will be outlawed .
About 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the Kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950 s .
Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used .
Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin , poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters .
Workers described `` clouds of blue dust '' that hung over parts of the factory , even though exhaust fans ventilated the area .
`` There 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos - related diseases , '' said Darrell Phillips , vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose .
`` But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago .
It has no bearing on our work force today .
Yields on money - market mutual funds continued to slide , amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates .
The average seven - day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC 's Money Fund Report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45 % from 8.47 % for the week ended Tuesday .
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year .
Average maturity of the funds ' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days , the longest since early August , according to Donoghue 's .
Longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period .
Shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner .
The average maturity for funds open only to institutions , considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely , reached a high point for the year -- 33 days .
Nevertheless , said Brenda Malizia Negus , editor of Money Fund Report , yields `` may blip up again before they blip down '' because of recent rises in short - term interest rates .
The yield on six - month Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction , for example , rose to 8.04 % from 7.90 % .
Despite recent declines in yields , investors continue to pour cash into money funds .
Assets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $ 1.5 billion during the latest week , to $ 352.7 billion .
Typically , money - fund yields beat comparable short - term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates .
The top money funds are currently yielding well over 9 % .
Dreyfus World - Wide Dollar , the top - yielding fund , had a seven - day compound yield of 9.37 % during the latest week , down from 9.45 % a week earlier .
It invests heavily in dollar - denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees , which boosts its yield .
The average seven - day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12 % , down from 8.14 % .
The 30 - day simple yield fell to an average 8.19 % from 8.22 % ; the 30 - day compound yield slid to an average 8.53 % from 8.56 % .

The federal government suspended sales of U.S. savings bonds because Congress has n't lifted the ceiling on government debt .
Until Congress acts , the government has n't any authority to issue new debt obligations of any kind , the Treasury said .
The government 's borrowing authority dropped at midnight Tuesday to $ 2.80 trillion from $ 2.87 trillion .
Legislation to lift the debt ceiling is ensnarled in the fight over cutting capital - gains taxes .
The House has voted to raise the ceiling to $ 3.1 trillion , but the Senate is n't expected to act until next week at the earliest .
The Treasury said the U.S. will default on Nov. 9 if Congress does n't act by then .

When it 's time for their biannual powwow , the nation 's manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like Boca Raton and Hot Springs .

The National Association of Manufacturers settled on the Hoosier capital of Indianapolis for its fall board meeting .
And the city decided to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners .
The idea , of course : to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the Rust Belt is n't so rusty after all , that it 's a good place for a company to expand .
On the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like Du Pont and Maytag , along with lesser knowns like Trojan Steel and the Valley Queen Cheese Factory .
For starters , the executives joined Mayor William H. Hudnut III for an evening of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and a guest pianist - comedian Victor Borge .
Champagne and dessert followed .
The next morning , with a police escort , busloads of executives and their wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway , unimpeded by traffic or red lights .
The governor could n't make it , so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests .
A buffet breakfast was held in the museum , where food and drinks are banned to everyday visitors .
Then , in the guests ' honor , the speedway hauled out four drivers , crews and even the official Indianapolis 500 announcer for a 10 - lap exhibition race .
After the race , Fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers .
No dummies , the drivers pointed out they still had space on their machines for another sponsor 's name or two .
Back downtown , the execs squeezed in a few meetings at the hotel before boarding the buses again .
This time , it was for dinner and dancing -- a block away .
Under the stars and moons of the renovated Indiana Roof ballroom , nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them Indiana duckling mousseline , lobster consomme , veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce .
Knowing a tasty -- and free -- meal when they eat one , the executives gave the chefs a standing ovation .
More than a few CEOs say the red - carpet treatment tempts them to return to a heartland city for future meetings .
But for now , they 're looking forward to their winter meeting -- Boca in February .
South Korea registered a trade deficit of $ 101 million in October , reflecting the country 's economic sluggishness , according to government figures released Wednesday .
Preliminary tallies by the Trade and Industry Ministry showed another trade deficit in October , the fifth monthly setback this year , casting a cloud on South Korea 's export - oriented economy .
Exports in October stood at $ 5.29 billion , a mere 0.7 % increase from a year earlier , while imports increased sharply to $ 5.39 billion , up 20 % from last October .
South Korea 's economic boom , which began in 1986 , stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes , trade conflicts and sluggish exports .
Government officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $ 68 billion .
Despite the gloomy forecast , South Korea has recorded a trade surplus of $ 71 million so far this year .
From January to October , the nation 's accumulated exports increased 4 % from the same period last year to $ 50.45 billion .
Imports were at $ 50.38 billion , up 19 % .
Newsweek , trying to keep pace with rival Time magazine , announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers .
The new ad plan from Newsweek , a unit of the Washington Post Co. , is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years .
Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek , Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine , and Mortimer B. Zuckerman 's U.S. News & World Report .
Alan Spoon , recently named Newsweek president , said Newsweek 's ad rates would increase 5 % in January .
A full , four - color page in Newsweek will cost $ 100,980 .

It did n't take long .
Route 288 , the circumferential highway running around the south - western quadrant of the Richmond New Urban Region , opened in late 2004 .
Already it is changing development patterns for the worse and causing localized traffic congestion around its exits .
The Richmond Times - Dispatch tells the tale today about the impact on the Huguenot Trail in Powhatan County .
Traffic has more than doubled in one section of Huguenot Trail since 288 opened , reports Will Jones .
Speeding and accidents have surged as well :
17 accidents have been reported near the intersection of Winterfield Road so far this year , up from 12 for all of 2004 .
Dale Totten , resident engineer for the Virginia Department of Transportation , noted that VDOT would four - lane the road for about $ 13 million if it had more money .
Of course , VDOT has no more money for road construction in the Richmond region .
One reason is that VDOT , at the behest of local politicians and boosters , spent all its friggin @' money on 288 !
Where 's Homer Simpson when you need him ?
This is a major `` D'oh ! '' moment .
As we predicted , Route 288 is generating residential development in scarcely populated areas all around its exits , overtaxing the local country roads .
While the limited access highway might provide limited traffic relief for people driving back and forth between Chesterfield and Goochland counties , other people are making choices about where they live and work ,
and they are creating traffic congestion in new places .
The only thing that surprises me is how rapidly this is happening .
Even I thought there might be a lag of three or four years .
If Route 288 has already created a $ 13 million road - construction in just this one exist , think of the liability it has created for all of its exits !
Here 's another prodiction :
After a few more years of scattered subdivision development and approval of mega @-@ commercial projects at major 288 intersections , the need for new road improvements will soar .
Before the end of the decade , we may well see the unfunded liability zoom well past the original $ 400 million it took to build the original highway .
To the brainiacs who thought Route 288 was such a great idea :
Thanks for nothing .
I think we could have spent the $ 400 million better elsewhere .
I do n't think you can blame 288 for creating those people .
If there enough of them to create new traffic congestion in new places , then what is the alternative ?
Additional traffic congestion in old places ?
Now you understand how people like TMT in Fairfax feel .
I 'd usually take the pro @-@ road position -
but with the glaring needs in other parts of the state , 288 was definitely excess ...
You have a city , Richmond , that has virtually no traffic .
The rush hour is 30 minutes long ...
And you give them a beltway through a largely rural area .
A road to no where ...
Just think if this money had been spent on another potomac crossing or road improvements that are desperately needed in NOVA ?
Virginia Centrist , To add insult to injury , the rest of the state helped pay for 288 in last year 's budget deal -- wiped the slate clean of debt .
It was very nice of you all to oblige us .
Did n't make much sense , though .
It 's the same old problem .
If you get out ahead of the need you are accused of causing sprawl .
If you build where the need is already acute , then the claim is you can n't pave your way out of congestion .
Anonymous -
That 's a fair point .
5 @:@ 26 makes a good point .
However , this situation hammers home the validity of the state auditor 's report finding that the CTB and VDOT fail to fund transportation projects based on a comprehensive state transportation plan , but rather , based on whoever does the best job of lobbying .
I submit that this is a disgraceful situation that should not be tolerated .
Moreover , Senator Chichester and his toadies would make this worse by pouring more money into this flawed institution .
What is the purpose of transportation - related expenditures ?
In Virginia , it 's to benefit private business plans and not to serve the public interest .
You all are dead wrong .
No less than Walter Stoch stated that 288 money was intended to be paid from economic development money .
Come on folks !!
TMT : I do n't understand your point .
when was the last time you were stuck in traffic that you were n't on your way to or from some sort of business ?
It seems to me that the whole point of roads is to facilitate the public interest in getting to and from private businesses .
Then , of course there is the sunday drive , the trip to grandma 's , and the soccer games , but still , the overwhelming need is to support business .
Since our road expenditures nowhere near match the increase in business or state domestic product , it is no wonder we suffer congestion problems .
If we recognize that roads primaarily benefit businesses then we should do two things :
let business pay for more of our transportation bill , ( which they will pass to us , of course ) and incentivize them to locate where they put the least stress on the system , even if that means more overall travel .
Why is it so hard to understand ?
The solution is functional human settlement patterns and a balance between transport system capacity and land use generated travel deman .
All else is spin .
EMR
TMT said `` In Virginia , it 's to benefit private business plans and not to serve the public interest . ''
I do n't see the point of this statement because it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public interest above all else .
I think they are so tightly intertwined that they are virtually one and the same .
Obviously there are local problems because this cookie dough is lumpy ,
but in the aggregate if we demonize business long enough we will eventually find out we all work for the Devil .
I do n't see there is any point in claiming as `` a solution '' a balance that is dynamic and ever changing in nature .
Even you see rail to Dulles as a positive because Dulles is a job center that promotes bi @-@ directional demand on the rail .
I agree .
In fact that may be sufficient reason to build it , all by itself .
All I 'm saying is that the exact same logic should apply to roads :
they should have destinations at both ends in order that we get maximum use out of our investment :
we need more places in order to get closer to the balance you say we need .
Reality check here -
I drive past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .
I commute back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail .
I 've never seen anything remotely resembling a `` flood '' of traffic .
It 's a 55 mph zone - 75 to 100 cars in `` a morning '' - over how much time ?
The Huguenot Trail road widening was already planned , due to the heavy demands of development on the Chesterfield side , the new schools , and a whole bunch of existing developments that were zoned years ago and at that time funneled through Robious Road .
288 , for those of us that actually use it , is wonderful - instead of Powhatan and Western Chesterfield being bottlenecked by lack of roads ,
we can actually get some commercial development and have the ability to work closer to where we live .
You may think that 's not rational land use .
I have no desire to live in any city ,
I will not work in a downtown area ,
I will not use mass transit , which is not safe for female commuters that work long and irregular hours ,
and I happen to LIKE large lot development .
How exactly I 'm supposed to keep horses on a 1 / 4 acre lot is beyond me .
Gas could go to $ 10 a gallon
and I 'd still pay to live in the country .
Many people have legitimate preferences - horses , hunting , gardening , certain types of small business - that makes them NOT want to live in an urban core .
This infatuation with city living truly baffles me .
Anonymous 6 @:@ 37 , You have every right to live in the country if that 's where you wish to live .
But you do n't have a right to have the rest of the state to underwrite construction of a $ 400 million highway to make it easier to shop and get to work .
What 's consistently overlooked in the debate ovre 288 is what else that $ 400 million could have been spent on .
How much traffic congestion could have been alleviated had the money been applied to other pressing road projects or , god forbid , even non @-@ road projects .
Ray Hyde - My comments were directed at investors who lobby to place roads near where they own property and the incompetent system that funds these requests without regard to their link or lack thereof to a master transportation plan .

Establishing Models in Industrial Innovation
After its competitor invented the front loading washing machine , the CEO of the American IM company believed that each of its employees had the ability for innovation , and formulated strategic countermeasures for innovation in the industry .
1 . Establish an innovation fund with a maximum amount of 1,000 U.S. dollars .
2 . Choose 100 innovative concepts to encourage employees to conduct research and development during their work time or spare time .
3 . From among them , pick out 50 for submission to an assessment committee to assess .
Since the Tangshan Earthquake , the starting point for construction standards in the mainland is that under an earthquake of the same magnitude , buildings should preserve their basic frame without collapsing .
However , most of the buildings in this hard @-@ hit area did not meet these requirements , with the widespread collapse of school buildings in particular arousing intense public disgust .
Raising standards to in excess of Tangshan 's 8.0 magnitude could leave authorities with some breathing space for explanation , and alleviate public anger .
According to information leaked from numerous channels , we can say for certain that before the earthquake struck , the serious earthquake risk in the Ngawa region was already well known to the CCP .
Although current forecasting standards can not give us an accurate prediction of the exact time , place , and strength of an earthquake , there is considerable experience accumulated both in China and overseas in predicting to within the timeframe of a month , and the area of a province .
In regions where the earthquake risk is high , warning the public and spreading disaster prevention awareness could greatly reduce casualties during earthquakes ; this is the very minimum duty that any responsible government should undertake .
In the past the CCP has done a lot of these sorts of things , but on this occasion not only did nothing , but in response to queries from the public pulled out some whopping lies , playing syntax games with words like "@ geological disaster @" and "@ earthquake disaster @" .
I think that if our Earthquake Administration had been able beforehand to do a simulation of big earthquakes on this Longmenshan mountain earthquake belt , then on that day of May 12 , once the Earthquake Administration had measured the quake at a magnitude of 7.8 , we would have been able to broadly judge the extent of damage and destruction in the earthquake disaster zone .
If the simulation program was well designed , circumstances like debris blocking roads , heavy rainfall obstructing parachute drops , power and communication outages should all have been within expectations .
Instead in this instance the Liberation Army headquarters emergency contingency plan obviously was not a contingency plan designed with earthquakes as the assumed condition , as the soldiers all rushed straight to Wenchuan , without immediately sending out troops in the direction of badly @-@ hit areas Beichuan , Qingchuan and Gansu 's Longnan ; only 24 hours later was the full extent of the disaster area taken into consideration .
In addition , the breakdown in communication also brought a serious problem to the surface . In the past , Red Army regiments were able to maintain contact with central headquarters by relying on just one battered radio . On this occasion though , people had no way to deal with the communication failure .
It is clear that preparations prior to the event were not constructed on the basis of an earthquake disaster simulation .
While it should have been a disaster relief command that takes overall leadership , it has suddenly come face-to-face with the broad base of disaster victims , directly dealing with them .
The lack or serious shortage of intermediate layers of Party organizations and units between the two has resulted in its inability to consider major issues with endless minor issues on hand , such that even if it is highly capable , it will n't last long , as it will be dragged down by numerous petty things .
This would have been unimaginable during the Great Tangshan Earthquake . A time without volunteers or mental workers , such petty things as directly dealing with average people were performed by the most primary Party branches , as well as enterprises and public institutions .
As soon as the earthquake occurred , grass-root organizations contacted their own people and average people also contacted their own systems or departments , in an interdependent manner .
Under the centralized leadership of higher @-@ level organizations , everyone acted to make the rescue efforts very outstanding and successful , such that the Great Tangshan Earthquake , which happened just a few years ago , was forgotten all together in the subsequent reform and opening @-@ up .
It is obvious that no social or political problems were left then , nor were sequelae that cause headaches to later generations .
During a time of prosperity and happiness , such a big earthquake suddenly struck .
Many people died , much property was destroyed , it was quite clearly a great disaster .
But it was not totally without benefits , and I believe that its greatest benefit was that it served to strip off the false benevolence that composed the outer skin of the elitists , the politicians , the capitalists , and exposed once and for all the rotten cannibalistic core within .
And an additional benefit was that many people who had been deluded came to their senses .
Temporarily laid aside these abstract things and avoided speaking at length , saying only a few details that left the elitists , the politicians and capitalists highly embarrassed .
The experts had just finished saying "@ Sacrificing yourself to help others is a foolish idea @" , when the leaders had no choice but to call once again for selfless devotion .
This was mere chicanery , to the point where before engaging in life @-@ saving , donation to charity , these sorts of behaviors , an idea had to be flashing through people 's minds @:
Am I being foolish in doing this ?
And when people saw on CCTV those private firms manufacturing tents in Jiangsu and Zhejiang working overtime to produce more tents , the first idea that popped to mind I 'm afraid was probably "@ This time these capitalists have struck it big ! @"
"@ Why is it that these capitalists instead of those capitalists get the big order forms , surely there could n't be anything fishy involved ?
During this process , there were again talks about filing a complaint against the Xinghui Travel Agency .
The reason for filing the complaint is that even if we owed their hourly fees , they still should fulfill their obligation on the contract they signed @: driving people from Canberra back to Sydney .
As long as we stick to this issue , Xinghui surely has no way of winning the lawsuit if it goes to court .
However , what greatly surprised me was the attitude of the student union in this appeal . They seemed very reluctant to make the contract public .
They even lied , saying that they and Xinghui initially felt that signing a contract would rather make each other feel like strangers since they were both doing it for the sake of the motherland .
As you know , this type of logic absolutely will n't work in Australia .
Xinghui accepted this order of ours and deployed all the buses of other travel agencies in Sydney .
Without the guarantee from the contract signed with us , they would surely have been unable to deploy them !
In addition , there was something else that was very suspicious .
I heard from a friend at the consulate that the government took this matter very seriously and had promptly agreed to allocate funds to compensate the students who had used their own money instead that night .
Yesterday afternoon I went back to check out the torch relay , but even the flame was practically impossible to see , let alone the guys carrying the torch .
There were so many people there it was frightening . Some had even climbed onto the roofs of buses !
I headed straight for the center of activities , but in actual fact traffic was being controlled as early as 4 o'clock , and they had already started limiting the crowds entering the sports center .
Some guys were really insane , banding together in groups and yelling out "@ Go China ! @"
I actually had some other classmates there , and was going to call them .
I guessed the carrying capacity of the base station towers was totally overloaded , and I could n't get through at all . I was only able to find a signal , not a chance of connecting to the Internet .
Only one phone call I made there got through - that was calling home .
I had a look at my call register , and out of dozens of calls dialed only one was properly connected !
Sometime after 6 I went straight back home to watch it on TV . The spectacle was just as astonishing on TV , except that it was just one angle of the whole thing .
Next time I will n't be partaking in this kind of activity !!
Wang Shi 's experience of being under public condemnation underscored to a certain extent the tense relationship between the rich and poor classes in Chinese society ;
because as China grows prosperous day by day , the gap of wealth between the successful elite and the remaining 1.3 billion people is widening .
Thirty years ago , people had basically the same incomes , which were all deplorably meager .
However , Hurun Report ( Hurun Report ) shows that by 2007 , there were a total of 106 billionaires ( in U.S. dollars ) in China , with the number of people only next to that of the United States .
Now , Wang Shi said , these responses have had effects on me .
He admitted that he was not sensitive enough to the current situation when he wrote his blog .
Wang Shi noted additionally that since China currently has not yet established a sound system of social security insurance , the growing hatred of the rich is unavoidable .
On Tuesday , Wanke announced that it would make an additional donation of RMB 100 million yuan for the temporary resettlement and post @-@ disaster reconstruction in the next three to five years .
Yao Ming , the basketball player who was hailed as a national hero thanks to his success in establishing himself in NBA , was also blamed after he announced his donation of RMB two million yuan because a rumor on the Internet alleged he had donated one million U.S. dollars for disaster relief of Hurricane Katrina ( Hurricane ) in 2005 .
Even so , donation behavior and the treatment of donation behavior should not deviate from two principles , namely that it is voluntary and does not seek return . Otherwise , the donation loses its original meaning .
In actual fact , whether it is McDonalds or any other foreign owned enterprises in China on the so-called "@ international iron rooster @" blacklist , they all gave generously to the cause of helping the disaster victims , exhibiting their social responsibility .
Even if by comparison some companies really did n't donate a huge amount , they should not be besieged or subjected to verbal violence in the arena of public opinion .
Donating , after all , is not a legal obligation that companies must carry out . Urging businesses to donate apart from the force of moral considerations should not take the form of any other coercive means .
As long as a company 's source of income is legal , any compulsory payment outside of legal obligations is a kind of theft .
Even in an abnormal circumstance such as disaster relief , legal order and the rights bestowed upon by law should be respected .
If we are unfortunate enough to be unable to avoid becoming a disaster victim , we can at least preserve the nobility and dignity of humanity and not turn into rabble .
The lawsuit proposed by Hai Ming did not have a clear subject of the right of action ; moreover it did not satisfy the legal requirement for libel .
For example , he failed to clarify whether Cafferty 's comment was an argument over opinions or an act of spreading an untruthful statement .
The malicious intent of Cafferty has not been established , either . More importantly , he has been unable to offer anything as to how to establish the damage to the 1.3 billion Chinese people .
In addition , in his complaint , it is said that Chinese people have already expressed their displeasure through demonstrations .
Here it is a country with the freedom of speech .
On the issue of libel , courts only support those who have actually suffered damages and have no other way to seek justice .
Therefore , it is very hard for the government , politicians , and public figures to get legal protection on the issue of libel ,
because they have the capability to clear themselves of "@ smears . @"
If you have already cleared your own reputation through legal protests , for example , Chinese people are not goons and thugs , then a lawsuit is meaningless .
Remember , a lawsuit for libel is only to clear your name and get compensation .
After Lee Teng @-@ hui put forth the "@ two states theory @" , due to mainland countrymen being deceived by the CCP 's propaganda machine , many people advocated using force to unite Taiwan .
Because they have no understanding whatsoever of the situation in Taiwan and the will of the Taiwan people ,
they universally exhibited extreme nationalistic sentiment .
Just like the love @-@ hate fusion of nationalistic war sentiment that erupted after the US mistakenly bombed the Chinese embassy .
They similarly did not understand the real story in Kosovo .
But Hong Kong people realize that first there was the Republic of China , only after that came "@ New China @" ;
While this "@ Two States Separatist Theory @" has purely and simply been dreamed up by the CCP .
Lee Teng @-@ hui was doing nothing but bringing an already existing phenomenon to light .
Moreover , the grand old men of the CCP who handed over on a silver platter a huge chunk of land in Manchuria north of the Amur River to Soviet Russia , who gave away land equivalent to ten percent of national territory in northern Mongolia ; why not take this back , instead of insisting on trying to grab back a Taiwan that remains in the hands of Chinese people ?
However , even though Hong Kong people have their grumbles , the "@ two states theory @" has in no way triggered a sentimental attachment in Hong Kong people for "@ Old China @" .
I believe that our building industry here has not yet reached this level .
Not only has the law not yet reached this level , but the average person 's understanding has generally not reached this level .
Some officials , out of local economic considerations , by accident or design are frequently too lenient in dealing with property agents .
We all saw the damage wreaked by the Wenchuan Earthquake .
As to how much of this was a result of natural disaster , and how much was man @-@ made calamity , a verdict will be drawn in the end .
Apparently , quality checks in the space industry are extremely rigorous , each part undergoes several inspection processes , every effort is made to ensure absolute safety .
But space ship accidents still happen from time to time .
Even such technologically advanced nations as the US have experienced several instances of space flight launch or return failures .
Since things can still go wrong even when they are subjected to incredibly rigorous inspections as in the space industry , then , with our current "@ dark @" and corrupt property industry the way it is , people 's lives are even harder to place guarantees on .
Once a powerful earthquake strikes , the people 's lives really do become as tiny as those of ants .
It makes one tremble even without fear .
Following the Great Wenchuan Earthquake this time , there were compatriots who struggled out of the debris , wiped their tears and buried the bodies of their families , but they braced up again and declared to the world , "@ we are not beaten down ; we are on our feet again ; the earthquake can not shake the staunch will of the Chinese people ; trials and tribulations serve only to revitalize a nation ! @"
This enables us to see the fighting spirits of the dauntless Chinese nation give off a dazzling radiance among people in disaster @-@ hit areas .
The fact that these words are spoken by compatriots who have been through the disaster has given us , who could n't help our tears at the sight of their mishaps , so much comfort and encouragement . It gives us a hint that no force can beat down the Chinese people .
However , the words later reappeared somewhere else and from someone unusual , which I thought about for a few days . I feel , for some unknown reason , it is somewhat scary !
I just want to say , let there be no more disasters , so that China is safe and sound from now on and disasters are far away from China .
I pray to the God to open his eyes and do n't let disasters visit the Chinese land again !
We do n't want to revitalize the nation through trials and tribulations ,
but rather we want to revitalize the nation by passing our days safe and sound !
One important reason that a great number of people buried or trapped in debris in the Wenchuan earthquake @-@ hit area were saved is that they were full of hopes and firmly believed the PLA would come to their rescue !
To settle victims , thousands of tents that stretched miles were soon set up , which contained public toilets , shops , and primary schools and middle schools .
Tens of thousands or even millions of those displaced by the disaster have gradually had a home to shelter from the wind and rain !
If everything were put in the market , such that all the land was sold to syndicates or farm owners , then where should the government set up tents ?
Do they expropriate the land on the spot ?
Even the government can not override the market !
Supporting the disaster @-@ hit areas has tested our competence , while the government 's ability to rule also stood the trial !
At critical moments , the ruling foundation --- workers and farmers , showed staunch support to the government !
If everything were put in the market , such that workers and farmers would have their fates controlled by the market and no longer count on or rely on the government by walking onto a path of the so-called "@ finding the market rather than the mayor ( government ) , @" then what power would the government have ?
The post @-@ catastrophe hyperinflation as expected by foreigners has not come either !
The government has human and financial capital under control , as well as energy and resources !
For example , the value of "@ seizing the pleasure of the moment @" also has a long history .
"@ Sing a song when thou have wine , seize the day since life is short . @" Some people in contemporary times think we should "@ satisfy and die . @"
Some people have gone so far on the road that they "@ do n't know how to eat or play , @"
and other take nude pictures and flaunt them online .
For another example , the pursuit of office titles and levels can also be traced back to the old days .
In ancient times there was Zhou Li to distinguish the order of hierarchy and nobility , constructing a pyramid @-@ like social organizational structure .
The son of the Heaven wore different clothes than others . The color of a door and the number of caldrons used for meals were all symbols to distinguish the hierarchy and nobility of people .
The aim was to settle disputes , stop fights and stabilize the society .
However , simultaneously it has also established a system that values life according to office levels , which to the contrary triggered contentions and destabilized the society .
Yet no matter how many changes of dynasties there are , the value system has always been carried on .
Higher or lower ranks in Qing Dynasty were distinguished by bird and animal patterns on clothes , Taiping Heavenly Kingdom used the size and color of a sedan chair as the symbol to distinguish between different ranks , and modern people use the motor vehicle displacement as a symbol to distinguish between different positions , all of which can be traced to the same origin .
I do n't care how much Wang Shi wastes every time he climbs a mountain , but I do strongly despise how he talks and the way he acts during this whole thing .
After donating , he suggested that charity should not be the burden of businesses , and therefore stipulated that his company 's employee donations should not exceed 10 yuan .
Totally absurd logic . Wang Shi 's reasoning is that making donations to charities then the burden of businesses could cause companies to fail in market competition ;
But we can see such philanthropists as Bill Gates , Li Ka @-@ shing , Jackie Chan have not affected the growth of their enterprises in any way . Instead , they have actually increased the competitiveness of their companies .
And there were some netizens who hit back in the Wang Shi donations issue by admonishing us for forcing donations on moral grounds .
Exactly ! An excellent justification !
If you say that netizens rebuking Wang Shi is forcing donations , then what kind of behavior is Wang Shi preventing employees from donating more than 10 yuan ?
Wang Shi is the economic version of a cold @-@ blooded animal , and we do n't care ,
but how come Wang Shi , how come he wants to restrict what employees do or do n't do on moral grounds ?
This really is a case of one rule for some , another rule for everyone else !!!
We see , as at May 17 , the Chinese government has accepted up to 6 billion in disaster @-@ relief donations domestically and internationally , of which 4.8 billion is from domestic donors .
What we can see now are merely the name and figure of each donor constantly listed in what is like an honor roll .
Yet unfortunately , we do n't have more detailed information of the whereabouts and specific uses of the donated funds .
As corruption has long been prevalent among local governments and economic auditing is not transparent enough , disaster @-@ relief funds are often appropriated , exhausted , expropriated and embezzled .
Therefore , once such a huge amount of disaster @-@ relief funds from people the world and China are embezzled or otherwise partially transferred by local officials , the resulting political damage and lowering of the government 's image domestically and internationally will completely negate the positive image brought by the government 's disaster @-@ relief efforts .
If the donations are directly put in the hands of disaster @-@ hit people , it would push local prices higher , driving the already high inflation to a direction that is even harder to regulate .
It is said that our country 's earthquake forecasting is at an advanced level in the world .
But the glory of the earthquake workers did not produce good luck for the departed spirits of Wenchuan .
So , we again hear expert figures emphasizing once again , "@ Earthquake forecasts are a global challenge that so far no one has been able to solve . @"
Consequently , we come to realize that the academic laurels for "@ the success rates of predictions of impending earthquakes that have already reached almost 40 % @" are just conditions and capital used to apply for funding , evaluate professional titles and seek remuneration , rather than a hard rationale used to reduce bloodshed and deaths .
We should offer earthquake workers our full understanding .
Facing the caprice of nature , humankind is really insignificant .
Furthermore , although our sense of security increases with each passing day in line with "@ significant advances achieved @" in seismology , we can not look to anyone to give us any promises .
Because , once someone has made a promise , he would be doomed thereafter to bear this bloody weight of "@ being unable to effectively avoid earthquake disasters . @"
And by not issuing any promises , he could actually avoid being censured .
Because "@ there is no way to make predictions @" !
Humans can manufacture tanks that are much more powerful than ants , but humans can not manufacture a living ant @...
However advanced instruments manufactured by humans are , their level of complexity can not compare with a section of a toad 's nerve .
Do not regard earthquake prediction as a "@ practical skill @" ; rather regard it as academic work in a study .
Take no notice of the real results in terms of preventing earthquakes or minimizing disasters ; rather singlemindedly pursue the scientific research level embodied in "@ prediction success rates . @"
In the course of major disaster warnings , too many disputes relating to powers and interests are entangled .
The directions of research into earthquake prevention and disaster minimization are just confined to research into the phenomenon of earthquakes , but efforts to intervene in urban construction , to formulate and supervise building standards , and perfect and improve disaster rescue mechanisms and other aspects have been neglected @.... .
We have also become blindly abreast of foreign countries even in earthquake research @: we do n't believe in living beings raised as part of nature ; we just believe in the instruments we ourselves manufacture .
We do n't believe the warnings sent out by nature ; we just believe the warnings emitted by instruments in laboratories .
We do n't believe in what is seen and heard with their own eyes by millions of ordinary people ; we just believe in the authoritative conclusions of experts and scholars .
Chinese seismology is galloping down the wrong road .
Real estate is only one part of the national economy but the real estate phenomenon exists in every sector of the national economy .
The swift large-scale failure and bankruptcy of collective enterprises and state @-@ owned enterprises is proof of this .
Things have reached the step where the national television station has to set up a stage with the country 's military singers , high @-@ class singers , as well as top-of-the-line celebrities from all walks of life singing to folks like Wang Shi for donations .
We should n't be too bothered if folks like Wang Shi say something unpleasant .
A defeated general can n't claim to be brave .
In front of folks like Wang Shi , the State Council are all defeated generals .
Because the missing @-@ in @-@ action army who built New China have been beaten to a pulp by folks like Wang Shi ; even if China has no earthquakes , there will be floods , as well as SARS , snowstorms , big freezes etc.
China is a land of many catastrophes - this has always been true and always will be .
Relying on singing for donations , entertaining for one 's supper , will not solve the problem .
And time and time again asking the national television station to get out there and carry the national flag , carrying on like this in the name of the country is outrageous , it 's the State Council 's problem .
All the people with one mind @" as the national anthem is inspired by the foresight of "@ always being prepared @" , designed for "@ advance , advance , advance , enter ! @" instead of being designed for repeated begging , pleading for donations , and fund @-@ raising .
From leaders to the common people , everyone needs to keep that in mind .
When we go back to the 10 th Century AD , we find that the 10 th Century AD gave birth to the first entrepreneurs .
Because the 10 th Century AD was the very time when limited liability companies were established ; the Catholic Pope of the time had such a conviction during the 9 th Century .
Are you afraid of going to Hell when you die ?
Yes , you are afraid - how could you not go just because you are afraid ?
Donate your property to the Church , show your loyalty to God and you will n't go to Hell ,
so a lot of rich people donated their money to the Church before they died .
By the 10 th Century AD , 60 % of Britain 's territory belonged to the Church ,
but their clergymen could n't manage it , and were unable to pass it on to the next generation . What could they do ?
So they set up the modern limited liability company .
How did they set it up ?
They hired professional managers to run these Church enterprises ,
these professional managers were the administrators ,
And who were the proprietors of these companies ?
The Church .
So what did this confirm ?
The first step in separating the administration rights from ownership ,
in no way because this was a great system , but rather that this was inevitable within the Church enterprises .
When forecasting earthquakes , why did it happen that only a few cases were successful while most cases were failures ?
According to this writer 's many years of research on precursory signs , the existence of precursory signs and earthquake predictions are two issues that are both connected and mutual differentiated .
The appearance of a precursory sign does n't mean it can accurately forecast the three elements of an earthquake , because precursory signs are extremely complicated .
There are certain differences in the categories , breadths , distribution ranges , and duration of precursory signs of different types of earthquakes in different places .
In "@ Regional Nature of Precursory Signs of Earthquakes , @" this writer divides earthquakes into two major types according to the overall characteristics of pre @-@ earthquake signs @: strike @-@ type and slip @-@ type earthquakes .
The former occurs in areas where internal fault blocks or fault lines converge but not intersect , while the latter occurs in active fault lines .
Strike @-@ type earthquakes have various types of precursory signs , which are widespread , long @-@ lasting , and quite variable .
Slip @-@ type earthquakes have fewer types of precursory signs , which have a smaller distribution range , shorter duration period , and smaller range of change .
In Chengdu , which is over 100 kms away from the epicenter , the earthquake should not have an intensity of over 7 , or 8 at the most .
There should not be any safety problems for Class A buildings like those at the airport , hospitals and schools that are designed to withstand a intensity of 8 .
So most buildings in Chengdu should still be able to use after emergency assessment , and citizens may go home reassured .
If not so , an investigation should be conducted for any jerry @-@ built projects .
If large sums of money have been spent to provide protection , yet it fails to work when the earthquake comes ,
such that nobody dares to live at home , is able to use hospitals , or accesses airports , then has the money been thrown for nothing ?
Probably some would say the national building criteria for earthquake resistance was enacted in recent years , and older buildings may not comply with the requirements .
However , at the same time the government enacted the earthquake resistance criteria , it required all existing buildings which did not satisfy the criteria to be reinforced and removed of dangers in a timely fashion .
Thus one can not shirk responsibilities on excuse that it is an old building .
In addition , the government also has criteria for earthquake resistance and prevention for rural buildings .
The earthquake in Sichuan stuns everyone .
Elementary school buildings collapsed , and children were buried in the rubble .
Middle school buildings collapsed , and young students were buried under the crumbled walls .
Kindergarten buildings also collapsed , and little children 's frail bodies fell helplessly next to the crumbled walls where they closed their innocent eyes forever .
We could n't help crying at this sorrowful scene .
Children are the flowers of our motherland and future of our motherland .
These flowers of life died early in a natural disaster .
Natural disasters can not be predicted , but the school buildings should not have collapsed .
Why are the buildings behind the school buildings still there while the school buildings where children studied collapsed from the first floor to the fourth floor leaving only crumbled walls ?
Children , you should n't have departed like this .
Every year , all levels of People 's Congress are held from local governments to the Central Government .
Deputies to the People 's Congress , please make an all @-@ around inspection of school buildings in all areas and inspect whether or not the school buildings in your constituencies are up to local earthquake @-@ resistance standards , and then quickly make a proposal according to the existing problems and push each level of the government to complete rectifications and improvements within a limited time .
Special legislation in the National People 's Congress on construction of school buildings should be proposed .
There needs to be special legal procedures for the design , materials , construction , completion , and inspection of the school buildings to ensure that top priority be given to quality and durability .
Allowing all children to study safely is the sacred and bounden duty of the People 's Congress .
In June 1976 , 83 year @-@ old Mao Zedong had already been revived once after suffering a myocardial infarction .
To get effective care for his condition , the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CCP established a special treatment team , in charge of his medical treatment and care .
The Political Bureau also specifically assigned people to the task of Mao Zedong 's medical care , taking turns with the doctors and nurses to be on constant vigil at his living quarters .
On the day of the Tangshan Earthquake , i.e. July 28 th , those on duty at Mao Zedong 's quarters were Wang Dongxing , Wang Hongwen , and Mao Zedong 's confidential secretary , Zhang Yufeng .
In the early hours of the morning , with the clock hands pointing to 3 @:@ 42 , the ground of Zhongnanhai suddenly started to shudder .
In Mao Zedong 's residence , the glass window in the foyer door rattled uncontrollably , and there was a huge bang from below like a tractor starting up , with Mao Zedong 's sickbed shaking non @-@ stop @.......
While Mao Zedong was convalescing , the employees and medical staff around him were all in a state of high tension , maintaining extremely silent surroundings and atmosphere .
In normal times , apart from the talking and noise of medical instruments when the doctors revived him , not a whisper could be heard .
After the nineties , state @-@ owned engineering enterprises stopped recruiting construction workers .
But that is n't to say they stopped hiring people , but those they took in were all graduates with professional diplomas from polytechnic schools , technical colleges , and universities ; these staff all went into management .
During the early nineties , the formal employees of this enterprise still had complete working teams , such as bricklaying teams , woodwork teams , steel reinforcement teams , and machinery maintenance teams , but since they could not cope with a large volume of project tasks , they were already cooperating with some migrant worker units , in other words the familiar "@ contracting gangs @" .
A collision occurred between tradition and reality .
Due to formal working units no longer taking on young employees , working units got increasingly older and broken up .
Some staff ( extremely few ) entered management .
A few exceptional former team leaders gradually became project managers .
Others became materials officers , safety officers and quality control officers , etc.
Those without connections became staff monitoring the construction site @------@ similar to the security guards of today .
The workers no longer formed complete operating teams .
And at this time , migrant worker units gained an opportunity to develop .
The entire on-site operation work was all carried out by contracting gangs .
Working units disbanded .
The status of these workers was also changing .
The corrupt mentality that treating dinner and gift @-@ giving is necessary for getting things done is deeply rooted in the minds of people from all walks of society .
In each case of corruption , those power @-@ wielding bureaucrats , those scholars or technicians who have cornered the market in their fields , those capitalists with vast wealth , they are the ruling force of this society , and also the ones who profit from the corruption .
The powerless , pennyless working public with no access to information technology resources %PW are the ones who lose out from the corruption .
Today 's society is corrupt in every direction , and the direct cause is the reinstatement of private ownership and the scrapping of the public supervision of the Mao Zedong era .
In privatized societies , everybody tramples over others trying to maximize their own interests .
Doctors who do n't receive '@ red envelopes @' have no motivation to properly cure the patient .
Teachers openly ask students to give them gifts ,
gang ringleaders use cash to have the media make them out as heroes ,
capitalists trying to annex state @-@ owned property team up with scholars and academically demonstrate state @-@ owned monopolies to be the reason behind corruption , and then reap in the profits .
Frequently the public , under the guidance of the mainstream media , only concern themselves with administrative and judicial corruption ; this in itself is a type of corruption .
Do commodity prices have a base value worth talking about ?
Do commodities have a true value ?
These are already elements of uncertainty .
With things , less is more ; sell as much as you want , as long as somebody will buy .
In fact , in a socialist country one can not act in that way .
In the area of profiting from commodities , there have been no systems in place and no legal provisions ever since the reforms , there is no last word on how many multiples of cost profits are allowed to be , or what percentage .
China 's self @-@ sufficient , natural economy was not without any advantages . At least it did n't try to reap large profits off its own people ,
now the exact opposite is the case .
A home appliance - whether you are Chinese or a foreigner , which regional category you fit in , whether you are a big city or a small city , whether you are a worker or a peasant - is always the same price .
Not knowing how much profit is in there , not caring who can afford it and who can n't , these do not seem to be the principles of socialism .
And with farmers @' grain and rural products , if the country does n't wipe out agricultural taxes and does n't offer any subsidies , keeping on producing is a problem .
In order to improve the people 's living standards , the government set things so that grain is always the same price whether sold to big cities or to rich people .
With this kind of ratio in existence , in struggling areas trying for a comfortable life is very difficult .
This issue should attract the close attention of economists .
December 26 , 1975 , Mao Zedong had his 82 th birth day , his last one .
Upon turning 80 , Mao Zedong felt apparently that he was old and would die soon .
Therefore , around his birthday those few years , Mao Zedong had always talked about life and death from time to time .
One thing he often said was @: "@ 73 and 84 are ages at which you will be gone even if the King of Hell does n't call you . @"
Also since he turned 80 , people had been paying more and more attention to Mao Zedong 's birthday .
Within the country , people dared not celebrate his birthday publicly , so they would celebrate quietly at home .
Local governments dared not present gifts to Mao Zedong , but would convey their blessings to Mao Zedong in various ways .
In the years before Mao Zedong passed away , his hometown Hunan would specially send things like long life noodles on December 26 every year .
For this , Mao Zedong had accepted with pleasure , which was quite unusual .
Despite Microsoft 's status as the globe 's most financially endowed high-tech leader , bargaining with Microsoft is something that is sure to leave you greatly disillusioned .
Microsoft 's dictionary has never contained the word "@ generous @" .
So when the Jerry Yangs hope that by bargaining they can bump up Microsoft 's purchase price , they are being very unrealistic .
Microsoft raising its price ever so slightly already represented a big concession , proving that it really does want to get its hands on Yahoo ! .
Ultimately choosing to give it up was obviously a very painful decision for Microsoft .
Right from the start , this was a super acquisition that lacked bite ; despite the numbers being huge , even if the acquisition was successful , truly revolutionizing the framework of the Internet was simply not possible .
However , when the acquisition did fall through , it was also quite disappointing .
To us global observers watching the bustling scene , giving up the acquisition was like a play stopped abruptly halfway through , without ever getting the chance to watch the rest of the fun , and indeed there was no shortage of theatrical transformations .
We have no choice but to return back to our mundane lives , and wait for this increasingly passion @-@ destroying industry to come up with the next affair of note .
Since last September , when his daughter was diagnosed with symptoms such as bloody feces and kidney stones , Zhou Jin has been in succession to Yongzhou in Hunan , Hebei , Xiamen , Beijing , Guangzhou , and more to take his daughter to hospitals for treatment , but the child 's illness has continued to improve and decline .
This September , Zhou Jin , working in Shenzhen , took his daughter to the Shenzhen Children 's Hospital for examination and treatment .
The results of the examination are that the upper rectum was severely infected and the right kidney expanded . The kidney stone found in previous hospital treatments was not found this time .
Zhou Jin said that his daughter , a little over two years old this year , had eaten Sanlu milk powder for over a year . Last September after the bloody feces appeared , family members took his daughter to the Yongzhou hospital for examination . The doctors informed them that "@ there is no better treatment method , just have her drink more water . @"
Worrying about his daughter 's illness , Zhou Jin asked the county hospital to issue a certificate to transfer her to another hospital , to let his daughter go to a better hospital for treatment .
The hospital Medical Administration Department told Zhou Jin that issuing of the certificate to transfer to another hospital would require the approval of the Ministry of Health , and more than one month would be needed .
"@ I went repeatedly to find the relevant health department , but they passed my case back and forth . I was helpless and could only take my daughter to the place where I work -- Xiamen , to carry out treatment . @"
Have to suffer this pain .
The doctor in charge told us that the kid would be out of danger if he could just urinate .
Getting him to urinate could n't be more difficult !
This urine is more valuable than gold .
He did n't pee at all during the first two or three days in hospital .
We were all desperate at that time .
The hospital already arranged for him to undergo dialysis surgery .
And my satisfying son finally urinated .
Out of danger at last , but one trouble passed and another one took its place , there came an acute diarrhea and fever , he was stooling several dozen times every day , you can imagine the suffering .
He had just danced a circle around the Grim Reaper , and encounted this problem on top of that . I was really worried he would n't pull through .
I do n't know what was happening with the injection treatment at the hospital - the more they injected him the worse the diarrhea , nothing would stop it .
After a few more days of treatment , the kid 's diarrhea was a little better and the doctors got him to do an ultrasound .
The kidney stone had been washed out by the medicine . There were no more stones on his kidneys .
The hospitalization was very expensive and our family could n't afford it , so we had no choice but to leave the hospital and go home .
On the night of Dragon Boat Festival he passed out a stone by himself , it was a sedimentary one .
The whole family was really excited , we all thought he was better , that he was cured .
Over 200 Han pupils in 15 th primary school in Urumqi were injected , *@ and there were actually Uyghur students from the same schools involved @* , it was shocking !
On the day of September 1 st alone , at the entrance of "@ Longyuan Supermarket @" on Urumqi 's Friendship Road , two people were injected and sent to hospital .
On the same day , in Shuimogou District , No. 106 Bus had just pulled up at the Gaojiazhuang stop when several people were injected , soon , the Uyghur assailants jumped from the bus and fled , but they were soon detained after bystanders gave chase .
The 920 and many other buses also experienced a number of poisoned syringe cases .
On August 31 , the No. 17 bus exploded near Xibei Road , while the No. 14 bus was bombed at the same time .
Nevertheless , all news was blocked .
But witnesses shortly after spread the news to the outside world by telephone - Urumqi security is extremely deteriorating !
Even more ironic was in late August , when *@ President Hu Jintao @* had just visited Xinjiang on an inspection tour . Upon his return to Beijing , the situation in Urumqi was far from settling , instead the *@ Uyghur terrorists @* becoming even more rampant , and the numbers of attacks and bombings were increasing rather than decreasing !
The incompetence of the Xinjiang government would make the Central extremely troublesome !
Listening to Yesterday Once More by the Carpenters , seeing the photograph album in which photos showing collages of compatriots receiving awards , I do n't know when people should cry , and my heart is lost .
After so many years can they still sing Yesterday Once More ?
Dear friends , let me fill in some of the words for the melody right now in my heart .
Do n't worry , the cold @-@ blood is n't me , it 's a part of my heart .
If an Olympic Games were held taking the damage done to mankind by industrial pollution as theme , I think our dear motherland should be able to win a gold medal and a champion of winning the grand total in gold medals . I just do n't know how the opening ceremony would be run , how volunteers should be recruited , or which song should be sung lustily .
The title of the sick man of East Asia once went far away following the revolutionary course brimming with victories , but after seeing this group of photos , I feel that they have whistled back with this brand new attitude of faster , higher , stronger .
What is different is that I dare not expect for ; in what way can we have again "@ The Destruction of Opium at Humen @" with "@ upholding the country 's interests with one 's life @" .
Because we and our motherland can not depart from this shocking pollution . What we can do is just to improve , adjust and vaguely hope .
The people who have been sacrificed have , without choice , used their lives to pave the road to success for another group of people .
At that time , tens of thousands of city youth headed to the countryside , but by no means were all of them were true believers .
Some were under pressure to show their "@ revolutionary zeal @" , others went because there were no jobs in the city .
The poverty and backwardness of the countryside were appalling , and most of the educated youth became disillusioned .
In the middle of the 1970 's the intensity of the Cultural Revolution waned , and one after one the youths returned to the cities or went to study in university , but back then there was n't an exam to get into university , it depended on your political background and behavior .
Jianguo was not one of these . He worked for seven years in a rural part of Inner Mongolia , became a village head , and was very popular with the locals .
He was a dab hand at working the fields , and could match the locals when it came to drinking spirits .
He married an old school friend of his from Beijing , and she stayed behind for him , the two living their own little lives together in the country .
Although the villagers had no interest in the various kinds of "@ revolutionary practices @" that Jianguo tried to make them adopt , he was honest and kind , and his generous personality won their friendship and affection .
After Jianguo had returned to Beijing for not even a few moths , the student movement in Tiananmen began .
Jianguo went to the square to listen to speeches and singing , and watched a new generation of students be rebellious , and was shaken and moved .
Twenty years before , the god of the "@ Red Guards @" was Mao , but the ideal of young people now was wearing jeans and a T-shirt , and a new statue had been erected @: Lady Liberty .
At that time I lived in Beijing , and every day went to the square . When we ran into each other , Jianguo did n't say much . However it looked like he had a million thoughts stirring in his heart .
One afternoon , I went to see an active figure in the square , and arranged to go together with him .
Friends greeted me with smiles , and asked me to go into their tent , as a meeting of student leaders was going on inside .
Jianguo was just behind me and had just started to come inside , when my friends frowned and stopped him @: "@ No , you can n't come inside ! @"
I explained , saying this was my brother . My friends listened with surprise .
Beijing @-@ born and Beijing @-@ raised Jianguo , he looked today completely like a villager from the countryside .
Wang Peirong thinks that this is related to blockages in the usual reporting channels .
He pointed out , all of his reports were made under the circumstances that the normal reports did n't work , and he had no choice but made reports online .
A typical example is that the fall of Dong Feng , the most debaucherous secretary labeled as one @-@ husband @-@ with @-@ two @-@ wife in the country .
Wang Peirong thinks that Dong Feng 's absurdity and corruption was actually an open secret , but nobody investigated and penalized ; and even though Wang Peirong reported on this using his real name to the concerned departments for one year , no one bothered to inquire about it .
Wang Peirong also thinks that reporting online is equivalent to publicizing the corruptive deeds of the person being reported against . Once under the public eye , the possibility of any blatant cover @-@ ups becomes greatly reduced , thus , making it easier to investigate and penalize .
Many people will ask , Chargeback Rival is made by an individual , so what is the relationship with 360 ?
There are likely three original reasons why 360 uses a person 's name to issue Chargeback Rival @:
General manager Zhou has done too much bad stuff on PC 's , and did n't want to offend too many people on cell phones , so he found an individual author to act as a scapegoat ( if a cell phone SP company knew that it was 360 that block their way . Each one of them is tough . ) ;
Using an individual author to issue it , it was easy to defraud the grassroots netizens of their sense of identification and sympathy .
If you see I am an individual netizen , who has been charged money , so makes a piece of software in order to help everyone solve this problem , then how moved it seems from the outside .
Using an individual author to issue , there has been a strong power of captivation . Many companies in the SP and wireless realm would definitely think that a product from an individual author would not have much influence , so would not pay too much attention to it .
Nevertheless , 360 already did this under cover of promoting Chargeback Rival in large scale . Once after Chargeback Rival became dominant on the situation , then it is to be transformed into 360 .
Having seen no hope from Xu Ming , Wang Peirong then could only post the relevant problems online .
Not only that , Wang Peirong 's generous and courageous endeavors have led to revenge from the reported on numerous occasions @: when reporting the corruption of Li Rongqi , he was severely beaten up by hired goons ; when reporting the black forces , he was retaliated by the black forces , and hospitalized for the injuries .
But these have not been able to halt the momentum of Wang Peirong 's reporting .
However , in the program , Wang Peirong calls out to the parties and the government to set out policies and provisions to protect the personal safety and legal rights of whistle blowers .
This program of <<News Night Banquet>> on Jiangsu TV 's city channel , caused a great uproar in the community .
But in contrast with this , Wang Peirong , well reputed as Jiangsu 's "@ number one person in online anti @-@ corruption @" , is now suffering unfair treatment .
Because of pressure from the reported officials such as Li Rongqi , China 's University of Mining and Technology has suspended Wang Peirong 's teaching duties .
How China University of Mining and Technology responds to Jiangsu mainstream media 's positive and active appraisal of Wang Peirong ; how well they treat Wang Peirong ; and how they protect Wang Peirong 's legal rights , are unavoidable questions placed in front of the Mining University 's decision makers .
The Chinese defense budget for 2012 is RMB 670.274 billion , increasing by RMB 67.604 billion and 11.2 % compared to the previous year 's estimated budgetary expenditure .
The Chinese military expenditures are increasing too fast for America , and the increase is currently over RMB 100 billion , but what on earth can China do with this additional amount of more than RMB 100 billion dollars ?
Based on the current exchange rate between the Renminbi and US dollar , it amounts to more than US$ 10 billion , which can purchase more than a hundred of the latest 3.5 generation Western fighter planes .
If it is used to manufacture Chinese J-10 fighters , over two hundred planes can be produced , or perhaps even more . In one go , China can improve its prowess in the air by a margin even greater than the total sum of a mid @-@ sized Western country .
In fact , what America really fears is not the increase of military expenditure , but rather the rapid rate at which China is upgrading its military technologies , which may enable China to overtake America soon .
Compared to America , China has many inadequacies , for instance , its high technology development is not as mature as America 's , and its basic infrastructure , the standard of education of its citizens , development of its systems and so on are also lacking . However , China has its own natural advantages , and that is China possesses a long history and stability of culture .
Some people pointed out in their comments that this is a serious disadvantage to China when compared to America , as they say that China is carrying too heavy a burden which will hinder rapid development ,
in fact , this reasoning is extremely incorrect , the Chinese culture is profound , so whatever problems the country may face , it can draw on its historic experiences ,
for instance , when China deals with international affairs , it can learn from how the Yuan Dynasty handled foreign trade and the problems of co @-@ existence between multiple ethnic groups , or it could at least draw a lesson from the negative experiences .
Currently America is drastically cutting down on its military expenditure , however it fears that China will substantially increase its military expenditure . America is desperately attempting to return to the Pacific Ocean as it wishes to continue to contain the growth of Chinese military strength ,
America controls the Straits of Malacca , and a large majority of China 's shipping vessels are under its control . However if America wishes to maintain the development of world trade order , its expenses will naturally be enormous .
If it were not for the financial crisis , a number of Western countries have stated that they would not have considered budgetary issues for American military deployments .
As a matter of fact , neighboring countries need not be too sensitive to the sharp increase in Chinese military spending . They fear that China will pose a direct threat to them , but Chinese history has shown that China has never had the habit of wielding its military might to challenge Western countries , but as for how they habitually view China will depend on the profound influence of the Chinese culture .
China does not like to show off , preferring to restrain itself , and the same is true in the field of military matters .
Up to now , China revealed that it has three models of the 4 th generation stealth fighter planes under research and development , and the J20 is expected to enter mass production and service next year , which is a direct blow to America ,
however , what is even more terrifying for America is that this Chinese fighter plane model has already displayed surprisingly advanced performance during combat , and it is feared that its level of technological advancement can not be matched by the F22 . After all , this model of fighter plane has never participated in actual inspections up to this point .
Perhaps this is understandable for China , but it is inevitable that the 4 th generation Chinese fighter plane would create a stir .
The original order has been disrupted . After all , the Chinese fighter is no less powerful than the American one .
According to American media reports , China 's military expenditures are expected to reach US$ 200 billion in two years @' time ,
Of course there is a strong possibility that this number has been greatly exaggerated , and it is also embellished by the China Threat theory . However , such moves by America no longer has much effect on China , even if the Chinese defense expenditures reach US$ 200 billion , America can not do anything to China ,
Recently , China adopted an aggressive stance , casting negative votes on the Syria issue three times , and in relation to Japan 's naming of the Diaoyu Islands , Beijing appears to be sending a message that '@ we have accumulated sufficient power , and we are not afraid of your distortions of the truth . @'
The Chinese military expenditures are soaring . By contrast , America is continuously cutting down on its military expenditures , repeatedly asserting that its prowess will be replaced by small but elite troops that will not affect its capabilities . As it is nothing more than self @-@ consolation , therefore , it caused widespread concern throughout America .
Certainly , this is clearly a refurbished version of the '@ military threat theory @' from America , and it is now changed to a '@ threat by military expenditure theory @' , however , China is used to finger @-@ wagging and criticism from America , and as China grows increasingly confident , this writer believes that America will terminate its friendly economic relations with China soon or later ,
China 's soaring military expenditures imply that China is reluctant to be limited to a position as the world 's No. 2 , and nor is it content to be world No. 1 in name only . Instead , it intends to recover its historical 1,500 @-@ year glory as the leader of the world .
The content is not quite the same as the title ...
Let me whisper this @: Doing business in America depends on connections , and red packets are also accepted @~@ same as in China ... :)
Faced with rascals and hooligans like the Americans , the Chinese have no choice but to arm themselves .
Indeed . I wonder what our military expenditure is like in proportion to America 's , and besides how much of our military expenditure is genuinely spent on sophisticated national defenses , if it is really spent on advanced defenses , there will never be such a thing as too much ! Compared to America we are still lagging far behind !
Now that Vice President Xi has visited America , the direction for the Sino @-@ American relationship has become the focus of world attention .
But no matter how sweetly imperialist America talks , I have no hope for imperialist America .
Imperialist America has always been a country failing to live up to its words , and as long as something is in its interests , it will spare no effort and use any means to get it .
The relationship between China and imperialist America is like that between the sheep and the wolf , and do n't expect the wolf to change its ambition ,
the wolf and the sheep can never be friends , even if so , it 's only an illusion on our part , it 's only a wolf in sheep 's clothing .
Ultimately , it will reveal its wolf nature , and I hope the sheep will not be fooled by it .
The whole world expects China and America to coexist peacefully , jointly preside over and deal with international affairs , and build a peaceful new international order .
The peaceful coexistence of China and America is also the common wish of the people in the two countries .
Nevertheless , the peace we aspire to will be only our good wish .
China is the fallen petals that have the intention , but imperialist America is the heartless flowing water .
Maintaining friendly relations with imperialist America is only the wishful thinking of some Chinese !
Though there is a great distance between China and America and there are no territorial disputes , unlike our relationship with the Polar Bear , there is a direct conflict of interest .
However , due to ideological difference between China and America and the lack of the necessary trust and communication in handling international affairs , it is particularly imperialist America , in its effort to contain the development of China and its threat to its hegemonic position , that makes trouble wherever possible to constrain the takeoff of the Chinese dragon .
Actually , imperialist America has the initiative in terms of whether the two major countries , China and America can get along ,
China has done a lot , and sacrificed a lot , for the Sino @-@ American relationship ,
out of its wishful thinking , China uses its warm face to caress the cold ass of imperialist America , but it is still unable to win imperialistic America 's sincerity , causing the Sino @-@ American relationship to waver and even fall backwards .
In future times , as China challenges its world hegemony and imperialist America attempts to retain it , more clashes will happen , conflicts will be inevitable , and the struggle will become ever more ferocious .
In recent years , as China 's reform and opening @-@ up campaign has reached greater depths , the people 's living standards have improved substantially , and its defense and military strength has also developed rapidly .
The status of China as a major world power has begun to be more prominent , and in dealing with and directing international affairs , China has played an ever more important role .
China 's rapid growth and rise has gradually threatened and challenged the hegemonic position of imperialist America .
This makes imperialist America restless , and it has devised every possible means to contain and check China 's development .
Imperialist America wants to upset and restrain China with its military sales to Taiwan and the Taiwan issue !
The Taiwan issue has become an everlasting sorrow in the hearts of all descendants of China .
Imperialist America wants to control the Middle East and suppress Syria and Iran mainly because it covets the important strategic location and abundant resources of the Middle East .
Imperialist America wants to overthrow the Bashar regime to get rid of the Polar Bear 's only military base in the Middle East ! It does not want the influence of the Polar Bear to exist in the Middle East region over the long term .
Imperialist America wants to topple Iran mainly to take on China , to control China 's resources and contain China 's development .
In addition , it also wants to suppress the Polar Bear and squeeze the living space of China and Russia .
In today 's world , the only countries that can constitute a threat to the hegemonic position of imperialist America are China and , to a lesser degree , the Polar Bear .
Imperialist America has had far @-@ reaching strategic foresight , and each step it takes serves to consolidate its hegemony .
Imperialist America is suppressing China in an all @-@ round way , and we can see imperialist America 's meddling presence in the economy , politics and military affairs .
Imperialist America has been supporting little Japan , India , the Philippine servants and the Vietnamese monkeys , disturbing the stable environment around China to disrupt the peaceful development and rise of China .
Imperialist America is now pompously returning to the Asia Pacific region and reshuffling its military deployment , directly targeting China .
Taiwan is the deepest pain for all Chinese , because imperialist America has long taken Taiwan as a pawn and used it as a bargaining chip in the struggle with China .
It 's a pity that many Chinese are still hoping to make friends with imperialist America and maintain a friendship with imperialist America from generation to generation .
Furthermore , the many strategic adjustments and ideas of imperialist America are all aimed at the rising China .
Many advanced weapons have been tailor @-@ made for China .
Compatriots ! Wake up ! Imperialist America has already aimed its guns to our heads , do not keep daydreaming !
Imperialist America takes China as its prime rival and enemy , give up your fantasy that you can make friends with the enemy !
The best method is to make good use of our time to step up our own defense and military construction , cast away all the illusions , and get ready for war !
Our ancestors wisely said , "@ Harbor no ill intention against others , but never relax one 's vigilance @" !
This is the necessary psychology for getting along with friends , but at this moment imperialist America is our enemy staring like a tiger watching its prey , making it more necessary for us to remain vigilant at this time !
China has made a lot of sacrifices to improve its relations with imperialist America , and China has all along tried to become friends with imperialist America ,
although China now needs a peaceful and stable environment for its development , we can n't make continual investments without any return .
Can Sino @-@ American relations be improved ? Is friendly development possible ? The key question lies with imperialist America , not China .
Imperialist America has always held the initiative in the development of Sino @-@ American relations .
In fact , it is not difficult for China and America to become friends , because China and America , despite their ideological differences , have no land or territorial disputes .
Though China and America have fought each other on the battlefield , the wars were not directly between China and America .
If imperialist America sincerely wants to make friends with China , it must display its sincerity and let the Chinese people see actual actions and results .
For China , the greatest interest concerning imperialist America lies in the Taiwan issue .
If imperialist America can stop its military sales to Taiwan , provide no support to Taiwan , and ensure peace across the Taiwan Straits , it will allow China to accomplish its great cause of national reunification .
If it refrains from meddling in China 's internal human rights issues , and also does not intervene in other affairs such as Tibet , I believe that China will also sacrifice its other interests to reciprocate the good faith of imperialist America !
Only if imperialist America does this can China and America truly become friends and co @-@ exist peacefully as friends from generation to generation .
Will imperialist America give up Taiwan ? Absolutely not !
Being used to being a hegemon , imperialist America likes to intervene in the internal affairs and human rights affairs of other countries , and Taiwan is the best chess piece for containing China , so I believe imperialist America will not easily let go of it !
There is even less possibility that it will tolerate a Chinese challenge to its position as the world hegemon !
In the years to come , instead of becoming friends , China and America will only become rivals and even enemies !
Therefore , it 's unnecessary to harbor any fantasies about imperialist America , China should fundamentally change its mentality , there is no need to fear imperialist America , and we should be ready for a military confrontations with imperialist America at any time .
Let 's win the respect of imperialist America and the whole world with our strength .
A peaceful rise is only our unilateral notion , because the big powers of the world will not accept the appearance of a powerful China .
Only baptized by war can China really become a world power .
The Chinese should be ever vigilant and not be deceived by the present peace , active war preparation is the only right choice ,
only when our defense and military have become strong , will we be able to eradicate all aggressors , and only through the baptism of war can China become a truly powerful country .
In my personal opinion , there must be a war between China and America in the future !
What China needs to do is to cast away its illusions and get ready for war .
China Mobile is no doubt a monopolized operator in China , the biggest mobile phone market in the world . It has also expressed clearly its ambition to step outside the country and participate in global competitions .
Even though the performances of Chinese companies are not outstanding in the course of globalization , Wang Jianzhou , President and CEO of China Mobile , is determined to change all this .
On the eve of the Business Week CEO Forum held in Beijing on November 1 , Wang Jianzhou gave an exclusive interview to the editor of the Business Week .
He stated that the objective of China Mobile is to become a world @-@ class company .
Wang Jianzhou , 57 , said in fluent English that China Mobile , which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange , has close to 300 million mobile phone users in mainland China , an equivalent of the entire population of the United States .
This signifies that China Mobile occupies almost 70 percent of the market share in mainland China .
Li Yanhong , Zhang Chaoyang , Shen Nanpeng , Ma Huateng @...
In the past 10 years , behind these Chinese high-tech magnates who emerged one after another was sure to be the shadow of the U.S. owned International Data Group ( IDG ) .
The annual IDG Conference was held in Sanya , Hainan on November 3 .
Apart from the seven partners , who are called the '@ Seven Swords @' inside IDG , the participants also included over 190 CEOs of companies that IDG invested in and representatives from investment banks and consulting agencies .
According to the practice of the past six years , after each IDG conference , there will always be some participants who make the list of magnates of the year .
I insisted on not paying him . Finally , he cracked and fled in panic .
However , I was also at the verge of collapse because the people 's police at 110 whom I looked forward to still had not arrived yet .
These days , overseas study has become popular . To friends and relatives , it 's a proud thing to be mentioned .
Children of the rich and government officials , who does n't want to enhance their status through overseas study ?
Let alone that getting oneself a western diploma will make getting a good job easier in the future . Even old dad and mom making a parade of it everywhere would look exceedingly good !
However , those in middle class families or even laid @-@ off workers see those children of the wealthy and powerful go overseas , come back cloaked in glory and all have a good future ( they do n't know that family wealth and good backgrounds of those are the only real guarantees ) . How wonderful ! Thereupon , they pinch and scrape to send their child overseas ,
It seems that once they are sent overseas , nothing but a wonderful future and unlimited glory will return .
Nowadays , it is more often the case that those who do n't pass the university entrance exam and are wasting their days at home without doing anything are sent overseas . With a bit of "@ toughening up @" , everything will be okay .
Wrong ! With a huge chunk of cash spent , the frightening thing is that the payoff falls far short of expectations .
Even more frightening is that it holds the child back .
I 've been in France for several years !
What I have experienced myself or , even more , what I have seen are the countless who have given up their studies year by year , those with wrecked health everywhere , those who sold their souls and even those who lost their lives .
Overseas study is a splendid term , but in return it demands youth , effort and staunch perseverance , as well as sufficient rationality .
Life is never a bed of roses in any location , even more in a foreign land where there is a language barrier , different customs and no family or friends .
Malformed society
The proposal on "@ the transfer of reproduction rights @" is originate from the same track the proposal on "@ controlling the number of rural children going to college @" ! What else are these representatives if not do @-@ nothing politicians ?
Fuck you ! Go to hell ! Fuck your mother !
Complete and obvious bullshit ! More sinister than directly selling and buying infants !
Can China still be saved ?
The one @-@ child policy is the most insidious policy , thoroughly antihuman and racially discriminatory , an open trampling on the right of survival right for Han people as a whole . Those who formulated and implemented this policy are all fascists ; they should be brought to trial at the International Court , and the people principally responsible for it should be hanged .
This guy really is a "@ representative @" , a-ha .
As known to all , Shanghai and Hong Kong have very low birth rates and mainly depend on migrants to maintain their population sizes and keep their populations young ; there is good economic development ;
In recent years , due to labor shortages , millions of black people and Southeast Asians have come to the southeast , and have caused varied degrees of deterioration in social order .
Just like Shanghai and Hong Kong , China depends on immigrants and at the same time pursues the one @-@ child policy , making the planning policy look like a very clever policy !
Shanghai and Hong Kong maintain their social development by absorbing migrants from other provinces , what will happen if China prepares herbal medicine by the prescribed method and absorbs foreigners ?
Do n't wait till the situation has become unmanageable and then drive away the gypsies as Sarkozy did ; German Chancellor Angela Merkel has just recently declared that Germany has failed to build a diversified society and will limit the development of the immigrant population ; now that the sheep have been stolen , no choice but to mend the fold !
Before long , the dividends for the population would wear out . As immigrant laborers swarmed in ( these people are not subject to family planning ) , the population would soon experience racial replacement , and China , as Yugoslavia did , would soon disintegrate !
The blacks , Arabs , and Vietnamese , one after another , would demand their rights , autonomy , and independence !
One after another , the local areas would become independent , as Kosovo did !
The minority peoples in Xinjiang and Tibet can bear more children , causing the proportion of the Han people compared to the population of the frontier ethnic regions to decline quickly ;
The regiments of troops and Sichuan women that such national heroes as Zuo Zongtang and Wang Zhen took great pains to transplant into Xinjiang and Tibet are being quickly exterminated by the one @-@ child policy ; the undercurrents of Xinjiang Independence and Tibetan Independence are getting ever more rampant !
The family planning policy and the one @-@ child policy have put the country in an dangerous as stacking eggs , and posed a threat to the survival of the nation .
Family planning has effectively reduced the Chinese population by 300 million , postponing the Day of 7 Billion by 3 years ; According to the plan of the Planning Commission , even if the Chinese population is reduced by 1 billion , the Day of 7 Billion will be postponed for just another few years !
But the Chinese nation will be on the brink of extinction . Such selfless notions which nobody will have until evolving into a nonhuman creature , surprisingly , has become a reality in China !
The issues of population and ethnical structure are major issues for the survival of the country !
Family planning is part of the plan to massively exterminate the Han people , and the beginning of dividing China !
The family planning policy is extremely stupid and the ultimate in self @-@ castration . It is unprecedented from a historic perspective and will be unmatchable in the future ; and in the global perspective , it is totally unique !
The self @-@ harming policy fully embodies the malice of the enemy and the stupidity of the those in power , brings disasters to both the country and the people , is totally void of conscience , contributes nothing to the contemporary time , leaves a legacy of trouble for a long time in future , and will definitely become a joke that those throughout all history will ridicule !
The other day , Xinwen Lianbo reported that the difficulty for enterprises to hire workers has extended to the west and swept the whole country !
The family planning policy is extremely stupid , brings disasters to both the country and the people , and is totally void of conscience !
Improving Population Quality Requires Transferring Reproduction Rights to the Rich ?
Through free exchanges on the market , nearly everything can be bought and sold .
Today , the right to bear a second child is also becoming a popular product with the rich .
They have money to buy the right , to bear the child , and to raise the child .
As to these transfers and transactions of the right to bear a second child , let 's have a look at how the representatives argued and legally struggled with government officials at the " Two Meetings @" .
Why did they propose such a transfer on the right to bear a second child ?
To this question , Li Xinghao @-@ the author of this proposal , NPC representative and Chairman of Zhigao Group , said that such a transfer is beneficial to improving the quality of the population .
Transferred to which kind of person , exactly ?
This representative identified 3 groups @: First , people with strong educational backgrounds ; second , the rich class ; third , civil servants .
Li Xinghao asserts that "@ In today 's society , people with strong educational backgrounds , the rich class , and civil servants have relatively high social status , relatively good economics means , and can ensure basic educational conditions and a good environment for the newborn population to develop in @" .
Why is such transfer practical ?
Li Xinghao gave his own specific explanation from the angle of market supply and demand .
He said , "@ For a transfer , people are not classified into the rich and the poor , but into those who have a demand and those who do not .
He said that the original motive for this proposal was rooted in his discovery that some families legally allowed to bear a second child , due to their poverty and other reasons , would become even more impoverished if they were to do so ;
while some rich families had a strong desire to bear a second child but did not have the allowance to do so .
He thinks that this conflict really exists , and the relevant governmental departments can take the initiative to establish a transfer platform . @"
This transfer proposal by Representative Li is indeed very smart .
On the one hand , it helps the government to reduce and narrow the gap of wealth ;
on the other hand , it also solves the structural conflict of the reproduction right market @-@ the poor have allowances but can not afford the birth and upbringing , while the rich want to bear children but do n't have the allowance .
Based on Representative Li 's proposal , the rich will voluntarily reduce their per capita wealth by bearing and raising more children , while the poor will increase their per capita wealth by bearing and raising fewer children .
Through such transfers and transactions of the right to bear a second child between the rich and the poor , the government can unnoticeably narrow the ever @-@ increasing gap between the poor and the rich without spending a single cent .
How can the wealth gap be narrowed through such transfer ?
This Representative Li has envisioned a fast track for the get @-@ rich @-@ first people to guide and assist the get @-@ rich @-@ later people . That is , "@ the allowance transferee shall give the transferor '@ an entire sequence @' of help and support . @"
"@ According to Li Xinghao 's plan , through lottery @-@ type drawing , the transfer platform establishes a one-on-one guidance and assistance relationship between the transferee and the transferor .
As part of the assistance , the couple applying for the allowance to be transferred in to them will buy the transferring couple all the basic insurances currently required by the government , including social insurance , medical insurance , and personal accident insurance , and will continue to provide them with a minimum living guarantee for the rest of their lives .
Meanwhile , the applicant couple will also provide financial support for the education of the transferring couple 's child until he or she graduates from university .
What 's more , if the transferring couple intend to register as permanent urban residents , the applicant couple shall buy them a 35 m2 socially subsidized apartment in the city where the applicants dwell , but all of the transferring couple 's land use rights in the countryside will belong to the applicant couple . @"
What do our family planning officials think of this proposal that the State "@ utilize the transferring of rights to bear a second @-@ child to improve the population quality and make the get @-@ rich @-@ first help the get @-@ rich @-@ later so as to realize common prosperity @" ?
In response , "@ Yesterday , Zhang Feng , Director of Guangdong Provincial Family Planning Commission , made his stance clear to the media that the right to reproduce is absolutely not transferrable .
In the event that the right to reproduce is transferred , it would not only be a violation of law , but also bring moral questions if it involved a transaction . @"
Through transferring their right to bear a second child and the concomitant obligations imposed on the transferees , the poor can get rich with the guidance and assistance from the get @-@ rich @-@ first class , if the proposal can pass and become law , the poor undoubtedly have found in the rich class , well @-@ educated class , and the bureaucratic class an obedient son to provide for them up until they die . Marvelous indeed .
He claims it is not a transaction , but how can it be otherwise ? In this bundle of obligations for common prosperity , where is the dignity of the poor ?
Does not the bundle of obligations proposed by this Representative Li still imply a contract on the exchange and transaction of land use rights ?
Certainly , without such exchange of interests , why would the rich take an interest in providing for the children of the poor ?
If the legislature really wants to adopt this proposal on the premise of the get @-@ rich @-@ first class leading the get @-@ rich @-@ later class to become rich by giving them one-on-one guidance and assistance so as to improve our population quality and narrow our wealth gap , it must ensure fairness in such exchange of interests and during the transfer .
Transferred together with a wet nurse .
Following it with interest .
For a transfer of the right to marry , people are not classified into the rich and the poor , but into those who have a demand and those who do not . Since I discovered that some men who have a legal right to marry , due to their poverty and other reasons , would become even more impoverished if they did marry ;
while some rich men have a strong desire to marry N concubines ( because their mistresses often fuss about wanting to get married ) but they do not have the allowance , and would be guilty of bigamy .
I think that this conflict really exists , and the relevant governmental departments can take the initiative to establish a platform to transfer the right to marry .
Pillaging the flesh till the bones are seen ?
Interesting ... interesting
Logic of hooligans .
Directly transfer the wife
A pack of luxury cigarettes ranges from as little as a few tens of yuan to more than a hundred yuan , if you smoke a stick , you are puffing away one month 's salary for an ordinary worker .
If it was bought with public funds , it may be said that what they are smoking are not cigarettes but the "@ blood and sweat @" of the taxpayers .
NPC Representative Ma Wenfang proposed that consumption of tobacco products on public expenses should be universally banned .
There are of course many reasons as to why we lag far behind in meeting our tobacco control objectives .
But one of the undisputable reasons is that a huge smoker 's group exists within our huge contingent of civil servants .
Among this legion of smokers , a considerable number smoke "@ free cigarettes @" which they do n't have to buy with their own money , as they were received as gifts or bought with public funds .
It is precisely because they are not using their own money that they usually smoke luxury cigarettes which are unaffordable for most people .
Their track performance for blowing smoke rings also has a compounding effect in repeatedly setting new records for consumption expenses by civil servants , and it has become an organic portion of officialdom corruption as a whole .
It was precisely this horrifying social backdrop that prompted NPC Representative Ma Wenfang to solemnly set forth her proposal that consumption of tobacco products on public funds be universally banned .
In our country , there are many civil servants who think their family name is "@ Gong @" and such that every expense incurred by them , regardless of whether it is for public or private purpose , should be borne by the public . Therefore , consumption on public expenses can involve almost everything imaginable .
For instance , besides luxury cigarettes , other examples include luxury liquor , fine wining and dining , luxury cars , and overseas tours , and whatever luxury enjoyment and extravagant entertainment they can imagine , they would want to have them all and enjoy them to fullest , using public funds to settle the bill in full .
If the supreme authorities had to draw up separate regulatory documents to address every single item for consumption on public expenses for nationwide circulation in order to check such extravagances , the mountain of documents will really extend towards the sky .
In fact , all that needs to be done is to clearly include tobacco products within the anti @-@ corruption regulations @' relevant clauses for prohibition of consumption on public funds , and it will suffice .
As for the remaining issues , we must ensure that the orders and prohibitions are fully enforced . If any civil servant dares to violate the law , he will be severely punished according to the law and regulations .
If this was really carried out in all localities at every level , there would be no cause to worry that the corrupt practice of consumption on public expenses , including smoking on public funds , can not be curbed .
After deputies and committee members have moved into their quarters in the hotel , how would service staff greet them ?
Some greet them with "@ Deputy So-and-so @" or "@ Committee Member So-and-so ; @" while some call NPC deputies "@ chief , @" which makes some deputies , especially deputies from the grass @-@ roots level , feel somewhat embarrassed . Some deputies even request service staff to "@ not call me chief . @"
Calling deputies and committee members who have moved into their quarters in the hotel "@ chief @" is , of course , out of the hotel service staff member 's formal respect , but it has actually caused misunderstanding of the identity of deputy or committee member .
As major national events , the convening of the two conferences has clearly provided the path ahead for our development .
However , at the two conferences , according to common sense , the identity of "@ deputy @" or "@ committee member @" is generally used , that is , "@ Deputy xx @" or "@ Committee Member xx . @" But I can not say much for the mention of "@ deputy as a chief . @"
Through the subtlety of greeting , we can see common people 's sense of awe towards "@ deputies @" and "@ committee members . @"
Actually , when providing services to deputies and committee members , what 's wrong with being a bit simple ?
Would n't it appear more cordial to directly greet them as "@ Deputy xx @" or "@ Committee Member xx ? @"
After greeting them as chiefs , do n't you have a sense of awe and awkwardness ?
As deputies , they should equally treasure their own first identity . Deputy or committee member is neither an administrative official post nor a honorary title . This identity means enormous responsibility .
At the "@ times of the two conferences , @" deputies and committee members should have an even heightened sense of responsibility . No matter what kind of social status you yourself have , remember firmly your own first identity and most important identity is a deputy , a committee member .
This is just a tidbit at the two conferences . The conferences that follow will unfold more exciting contents in front of us .
They are scumbags
Gosh , they even dare to use the word '@ awe . @' Common people could n't wait to '@ despise @' them , how could they have a sense of '@ awe ? @'
What would you say , which thingy there is publicly elected by common people formed by the first , second , and third person such as you , me , and him ?
Before the two national conferences were convened , various major news websites and periodicals across the country in succession invited netizens and readers nationwide to submit "@ suggestions for the two conferences . @"
This writer from "@ suggestions for the two conferences @" submitted by netizens across the country on various major news websites on the central government 's strengthening of efforts to oppose corruption and promote honest government , better supervision of the government and officials , and severe punishment for people engaged in embezzlement and corruption .
When CPPCC delegate Mao Xinyu checked in to attend the "@ two conferences @" and spoke of a motion he proposed this year , he said the emphasis was on anti @-@ corruption efforts .
The anti @-@ corruption drive involves everyone , from the ordinary people below up to and including the delegates to the two conferences .
At present , public expenditure on food and entertainment nationwide has already reached 300 billion a year .
Such a huge figure for public expenditure on food and entertainment crowds out expenditure on things vital for people 's welfare , including education , hygiene , healthcare , and social security .
Figures listed in a bill drawn up by the Jiusan Society 's central organization before the two conference in 2012
are really unbelievable @: annual public expenditure on food and entertainment actually reaches 300 billion ! How large is this figure of 300 billion ?
If we saved this 300 billion and invested it in the economically undeveloped and impoverished regions in China , how many schools could we build ?
How many poor families could we assist ? How many children forced to leave school could we assist ?
It 's a pity that this 300 billion is squandered with no results , wasted in the pursuit of debauchery , by corrupt officials - How could our people not hate the "@ parasites @" hidden among the membership ranks of the Communist Party ?
When corruption among government officials is brought up , the ordinary people all gnash their teeth , but the ordinary people are , after all , the ordinary people , and can only look on helplessly in silent fury .
The ordinary people can not afford to upset government officials , for if the ordinary people dared to upset government officials , they would be cracking eggs against rocks . Not only could they get more than they bargained for ; if something went wrong , they could end up in prison , or even endanger their lives .
Every year , there are cases across the country where ordinary people , because of reporting government officials , suffer the disaster of imprisonment if they get up lightly or the disaster of death if they are dealt with harshly .
It is common for ordinary people , with no other means of redress , to post on the Internet out of resentment against savage land requisitions or the savage demolition of homes and forced relocation by local government officials , but what fate do they often bring on themselves ?
Local government officials easily pin some labels on you , and you can even be chased and arrested by public security bodies across provincial boundaries .
The most terrible thing is not the government officials , but the power that lies in the hands of these officials .
How can we prevent the "@ three types of consumption on public funds ? @"
If we are to prevent the "@ three types of consumption on public funds , @" we must first "@ block @" the officials @' mouths ,
but this is easier said than done . Why ?
As people working in a lower @-@ level work unit , if leaders from higher @-@ level work units come , do you dare not to entertain them in the most respectful way with nice things to eat and drink ?
If they are not entertained well with nice things to eat and drink , after they 've gone , will officials in the lower @-@ level work unit still have a future ?
To their subordinates , senior leaders are all their "@ masters . @" You can n't afford to upset any of them , and whoever upsets them is in for it . If you rub them up the wrong way when you 're trying to butter them up , you will n't just jeopardize your official position , you will n't even know what the consequences will be .
To stop the "@ three types of consumption on public funds , @" senior officials must first "@ block @" their own mouths .
In April 2011 , when the no. 6 inspection group of Hubei 's provincial party committee went to Yichang city on an inspection tour of Zigui county , a national @-@ level impoverished county , the local government officials were both delighted and worried .
What delighted them was that they had an opportunity to report their problems to senior leaders and have them taken seriously by them , and what worried them was that there were 13 people in the inspection group , coming for 20 days or so , and the entertainment expenses , the cost of the gifts , and the inspection fees and various other items of expenditure would altogether come to 801,900 yuan .
How could this national @-@ level impoverished county pay the bills ?
This example is the best illustration that if we are to prevent the "@ three types of consumption on public funds , @" we must first stop the senior government officials .
If the upper beams are correctly placed , the lower beams will not go awry .
If the central state authorities are to stop the "@ three types of consumption on public funds , @" they must dare to do what they mean .
It should be said that wining and dining on public funds as pointed out by scholars is an objective reality .
With the increasing prevalence of the alcohol culture at the grass @-@ roots institutions , alcohol has already been fermented and adulterated by the so-called "@ bureaucratic culture @" beyond recognition .
Some people put on high-end wine banquets trying to please their superiors , some people use alcohol as gifts to seek personal gain , some people consider it a type of pleasure to get people to drink by using beer games , and some people get carried away because of their addiction to alcohol or drunkenness , adversely affecting their work .
Every year the amounts of food trashed and money wasted as a result of wining and dining on public funds are even more appalling .
This writer has lived for a long time at the grass @-@ roots level and often heard and witnessed some grass @-@ roots officials almost sitting at meal gatherings or attending banquets every day , and never getting tired of it .
How much is the wining and dining expense at the grass @-@ roots level in one year ? A specific number is virtually never published .
Actually , the insiders are well aware that this is a considerably high expenditure .
Who should be blamed for the grass @-@ roots officials @' wining and dining becoming common practice ?
Speaking with regard to the grass @-@ roots levels , it is indeed necessary to conduct rectification and to straighten things up according to the relevant regulations , but focusing on the grass @-@ roots levels alone may not be enough .
Throughout the year , various types of inspection groups and investigation groups , as numerous as the hairs on an ox , come and go in an endless stream , also making the grass @-@ roots institutions overburdened . Some grass @-@ roots leading cadres , with no choice but to run between the various dinner parties every day , also feel somewhat helpless .
There are also many people wallowing in the array of wine glasses and poker chips becoming "@ vessels for wine and bags for food . @"
This writer met with some township officials . Facing more and more dinner parties , many of them are fed up with it , but also feel forced and helpless .
The reasoning they explained is that entertaining is just for solving problems .
A township official , using his fingers to count , told this writer that in order to solve financial , road repair , canal construction projects and so on , they must entertain the relevant personnel and department heads , otherwise it will be of no avail .
When I look back to all these years , the urban construction in Beijing has experienced rapid development .
Some people said that it borrowed the easterly wind of the Olympics . However , I think otherwise .
Even though the 2008 Olympics allowed Beijing to display its charisma in front of cameras of all caliber that frocked in from all sides ,
it has almost been four years since the Olympics and the urban development in Beijing still has not stopped .
Speaking of urban development , the most representative one is none other than the Beijing subway .
Those who were born and raised in Beijing in the 80 s can almost be called the generation who grew up sitting on the subway .
The public transportation then could not be considered as convenient compared to now . Buses could hardly be said as providing easy access to all directions .
However , with their extensive coverage , the two subway lines provided novelty and convenience to many Beijing residents and visitors who travelled from afar .
The subway is a distinguishing traffic feature of Beijing . As one of the first Chinese cities to have underground transportation , the emergence of subway has provided everyone more choices .
This underground railway line that runs through eastern and western Beijing has become Beijing 's symbol of alternative culture .
Day by day , Beijing is developing , so are its public transport and highways . Eventually , it will usher in the alarming data of 5 million cars in 2012 .
Meanwhile , the crowded highways and complicated road traffic cause people to have greater expectations in the development of the subway .
I have to applaud the continuous increase in the efforts in subway construction of Beijing in all these years when I talk about subway development .
In July 2001 , with the success in the bid to host the Olympics , Beijing subway Line 13 also ushered in the completion of the entire line and became the newest member of the Beijing subway family .
Meanwhile , in October 2007 , the closely watched subway Line 5 went into operation . It became the new trunk that links southern and northern Beijing and intersects with Line 1 .
While Beijing residents enjoyed the modernization of subway Line 5 , in July 2008 , the first phase of construction of subway Line 10 and in September 2009 , subway Line 4 and Line 8 all became operational one after another . At the same time , all suburban districts and counties are all connected by the subway successively .
In about 10 years time , the Beijing subway transformed from an underground supplementary means of transport that only had two lines to a 15 @-@ lined underground transportation network that covers almost the entire Beijing from Changping in the north to Daxing in the south , Mentougou in the west , and Tongzhou District in the east .
Such rapid development was almost unimaginable by anyone and unachievable by any country .
While 2012 is quickly approaching , there is even the spectacular scene of four lines opening at the same time . It is veritably "@ putting all firepower into operation @" !
The rapid coverage of underground transportation has brought along prosperity to surrounding communities of the subway . Residents no longer have to worry about which bus route to take when they go out .
More residents gladly choose to travel by subway . It is both convenient and cozy .
Needless to say , the subway has brought about convenience to the travel and work of the residents . More commendable is that the convenient subway has allowed more residents to give up their cars and choose such green means of transportation that is environmental friendly .
Not only does a reduction in cars on the road alleviate traffic pressure on the road ; it also reduces the pressure of air pollution so that more residents can cheer for the blue sky of Beijing from their heart .
These are all contributions of the subway . Yet , where did the contributions of the subway come from ? They were naturally from the rapid development of the subway in Beijing within these 10 years .
The development of the subway is the same as the rapid global development of the city of Beijing , it will become a permanent city symbol of Beijing and a benefiting project that earns the satisfaction of the residents and the respect of the world .
Beijing Forces Ma Ying @-@ jeou to Declare Stand on Unification , Taiwan Can No Longer Turn Back
It can be said that the elections that cover five major cities have stirred up a storm in Taiwan .
In the midst of all this commotion , James Soong made a sudden appearance to come head to head with Ma Ying @-@ jeou in the elections .
This made the already worried Ma Ying @-@ jeou even more anxious , but there is nothing he can do .
This is linked to the earlier stand mainland China made regarding military cooperation with Taiwan . In addition , James Soong has expressed clearly that his taking part in the elections is to tell Ma Ying @-@ jeou that he had worked hard to get the 1992 Consensus from mainland China and Ma should not let everyone down .
Regarding the chaos in Taiwan and the future ultimate unification of mainland China and Taiwan , what else do we still need to face ? What else do we have to do ?
Regarding the "@ weathervane @" of Ma Ying @-@ jeou 's stand , what other preparations should we make ?
James Soong 's transfer of allegiance is to force the undecided Ma Ying @-@ jeou to declare his stand on the ultimate unification
Soong 's transfer of allegiance is , in a certain sense , a kind of response to mainland China 's intention .
On the issue of mainland China and Taiwan , Ma Ying @-@ jeou has gotten a lot of room for maneuvering ,
from playing the Taiwan independence card for the sake of the elections to playing the card of attacking mainland China and achieving military balance for the sake of the elections . However , on the issue of the ultimate unification of mainland China and Taiwan , not only did Ma Ying @-@ jeou fail to make any progress , he even took a big step backward .
In the past , he was standing close to the middle . Now , he is starting to gradually follow the footsteps of the DPP . He keeps pushing the bottom line of mainland China for the mere sake of manipulating the elections . Furthermore , he completely ignores the compromises made by mainland China and the effort it has put in for peaceful unification .
To save the Taiwanese economy , mainland China has made huge policy adjustments such as absorbing Taiwan 's excess industrial capacity , buying Taiwan 's excess agricultural products , giving several Taiwanese political figures room for international affairs to carry out international affairs , etc.
However , after all this waiting , in the end it has to face Ma Ying @-@ jeou'a a double @-@ headed snake that is seemingly false and real at the same time .
Therefore , facing this undecided Ma Ying @-@ jeou , James Soong stepped up to defend mainland China !
Is n't Ma Ying @-@ jeou wanting to score more points for his selection ? Is n't he wanting to elevate his position through manipulating the people ?
The moment James Soong appeared , the situation changed ! This is to force Ma Ying @-@ jeou to stop manipulating the elections and declare his stand on the ultimate unification of mainland China and Taiwan !
Ma Ying @-@ jeou is Not Mainland China 's Only Choice , But Mainland China is Going to Be Ma Ying @-@ jeou 's Only Choice
So , what cards is Old Ma left with to play ?
Military purchase - fetus died in the womb ;
economic development - eclipsed by the prosperity of mainland China ;
culture - fully integrated with mainland China as well ;
as for military affairs - Taiwanese soldiers , whether ex @-@ service or in service , are all under the control of mainland China 's military departments .
As for the key Taiwanese figures who hold military power , mainland China has long ago convinced them with reasons .
Fellow countrymen should not slaughter one another , and brothers should not turn against one another - this makes the Taiwanese military less hostile towards mainland China .
As for the withdrawal of missiles proposed by Ma Ying @-@ jeou , it is also no longer an issue now .
So what is Ma Ying @-@ jeou still waiting for ? For a major change to take place in Taiwan ?
To mainland China , Ma Ying @-@ jeou is no longer mainland China 's only choice .
Mainland China is actively seeking all forces in Taiwan that can be sought . Even the DPP is starting to change its course .
However , Ma Ying @-@ jeou , who is holding on and keeping his mouth tight , has no other choices except mainland China , in other words , mainland China is Ma Ying @-@ jeou 's only choice .
Basically , all the big bosses of the Kuomintang have visited mainland China and even received VIP treatment , getting all the respect they deserved .
So , is Ma Ying @-@ jeou thinking about his future position or the great cause of the national unification ?
Ma Ying @-@ jeou might offend some people in Taiwan who are eager to achieve Taiwan independence , but Ma Ying @-@ jeou can gain the respect of the entire Chinese population of 1.4 billion . Comparing the two , it should be clear which is important and which is not .
When Nixon visited China back then , he turned the Sino @-@ American relationship around . So , does n't Ma Ying @-@ jeou want his name to go down in history ?
Could it be that being the bill of a chicken is really better than being the anus of an ox ?
Hence , Ma Ying @-@ jeou should understand that he is only one of the choices of mainland China . It is up to him whether he wants to achieve success and acquire fame .
Watch out for Ma Ying @-@ jeou 's Continued Military Resistance against Unification by the Lease @-@ to @-@ own method
Though the United States has recently increased its military presence in the Asia Pacific region , it is showing a rare undecided stand on the Taiwan issue .
The United States is no longer able to tell where Taiwan is heading , because all Taiwanese senior politicians are talking about unification and there is less and less talk about secession .
Furthermore , a certain tacit agreement between mainland China and Taiwan regarding the Diaoyu Islands has made the United States feel somewhat unable to do what it wants to do .
However , some people from the United States and Taiwan are still somewhat intelligent .
They no longer talk about military purchase but started proposing a lease @-@ to @-@ own method for Taiwan to get weapons .
The weapons Taiwan has now are old .
The lease @-@ to @-@ own method might bring some advantages in conducting cutting-edge military confrontation with mainland China , but fundamentally speaking , Taiwan no longer has the strength to fight against mainland China .
If it continues to take its old path of resisting unification through military forces , then it will meet a very tragic ending !
Diaoyu Islands Will be a Touchstone - Taiwan Can No Longer Turn Back
Of course , there are still many opportunities for mainland China and Taiwan . For example , the Diaoyu Islands is the first touchstone of cooperation between mainland China and Taiwan .
When it comes to the Diaoyu Islands , mainland China and Taiwan can jointly deploy naval vessels , jointly defend the Diaoyu Islands , and join hands in fighting Japan .
Recently , within Taiwan , active actions have been taken concerning the ownership of Taiwan as well .
For example , there have been active changes as to how the Japan issue is treated , how the historical issue of the resistance war is treated , and how the issue of Taiwan as part of mainland China in the past is treated .
It is these changes that made the entire Taiwan , from top to bottom , reach a consensus that it can survive by staying close to mainland China .
Facing mainland China 's offensive efforts towards unification , Taiwan can no longer turn back .
Taiwan will become another traitor if it goes into Japan 's embrace . Only by going into mainland China 's embrace will Taiwan have a bright future !
In short , James Soong is merely someone through whom mainland China 's stance ranging from active cooperation to slight warning is demonstrated .
If Ma Ying @-@ jeou does not want to oversleep after going back to bed in the morning , he must truly face what the people of both sides of the Strait have been hoping for for a century !
It is up to him whether he wants to be a sinner of the nation or a meritorious contributor to the nation !
When that time comes , the people of mainland China will respond enthusiastically to Ma Ying @-@ jeou !
What 's going on !
Damn , these people who do n't learn to be good should rot at home . Why are they coming out ?
Endangering the society !
Really , one should not be a Samaritan
If you help the other person get up but she does not appreciate it and even pushes you , then you should not help her anymore .
Yet you help her again ...
Do n't tell jokes at the seaside . It will trigger tsunami
It is really too tragic
Meeting violence with violence does not benefit anyone
Woes of the society .
Those who make trouble after getting drunk should be punished without leniency . Detestable
The following is a quote from Qiuyeyuanmaoerkong from the second posting @:

It is really tough being a good person .
The old man was looking for trouble ...
Nowadays , there are many scumbags around @~

Damn , nowadays one should not be a good person
"@ The society always makes you feel painfully scared . Every day , there always seem to be countless reasons that make people curse ! @"
This is well said ...
This is what you call unforeseen misfortune
People say , do not do good things . He did n't listen ... sigh ,
Scary
The following is a quote from Ninth Inspiration from the tenth posting @:

Why did n't they get knocked down by a car and die after getting drunk ? Scumbags !
The following is a quote from zhukong81 from the 16 th posting @:
Woes of the society ...
Good people are beaten into extinction just like this , they 're all done for
Right , you 're so old , why did you go and help a young man up ... It 's tough to be a good person
It 's tough to be a good person
Never be a good person ... Always remember ...
If severe punishment is not given , in future everyone will pretend to be drunk and make trouble

A Letter from the Victim 's Family
First of all , I would like to thank a kind @-@ hearted person for calling the police immediately . I would also like to thank the public security authority for the prompt capture of the perpetrators .
Early in the morning on September 1 , my father , as usual , was riding his bicycle to Gucheng Park for exercise . At Jiuli Street , he saw someone lying on the side of the road , and so , out of kindness , he went up to check up on him and ask him to go home soon . Then , three people ran up to him , kicking and beaing him ( according to the police , they had drunk four cases of beer at the time ) . As a result , my father 's skull suffered serious injury . He bled profusely and lost consciousness . By the time he was taken to the hospital , his pupils were already dilated . However , with prompt rescue given by a doctor , he survived . As there was serious bleeding , the doctor performed a life @-@ saving surgery to cut off a piece of skull from my father 's head to remove blood clots . Due to profuse bleeding , some of the blood had already flowed into the brainstem and bottom of the brain , putting his life in danger .
Right now , my father is in very serious condition . On September 1 , he underwent a 5 @-@ hour craniotomy . On September 2 , he had a tracheotomy and a respirator was used to help him breathe . Currently , he is still unconscious . After these few days of hospital treatment , he is sometimes able to move his arms and feet , and he is showing signs of recovery .
As his children , we feel very terrible now . It has been six days since the incident . Under the police 's advice , the perpetrators finally gave 10,000 yuan . We have already delivered the money to the hospital . Now , almost 50,000 yuan has been spent on the medical bills . We do n't know when we can get money to pay for future medical bills .
We have now already received a payment reminder from the hospital . If we do not pay on time , the hospital will stop supplying medications . When that happens , I can not bear to think of what will happen to my father .
Our family has very poor living conditions . My mother only gets a minimum welfare pay of 380 yuan , and she has diabetes . My father is a retired coking plant worker . His pay is also just a bit over 1,000 yuan . I am doing odd jobs at a factory , and I have not even made any medical insurance or pension contributions . My elder sister is also an odd @-@ job worker . She has also not made any pension or medical insurance contributions . Furthermore , I am going to be a father soon . I have a very heavy family burden . Our family now can only rely on my father 's pay to survive . We absolutely can not afford such high hospital costs .
It has been six days since the incident . As victims , we have the rights of a citizen to know some things @:
1 . Where are the perpetrators from ? How are their family and financial conditions ?
2 . When can the case be submitted to the procuratorate ? When can public prosecution be initiated ?
3 . We hope the perpetrators can cooperate actively and take practical actions to work together to first save my father 's life .
4 . We request to meet the parents of the perpetrators .
We hope the news media can help us to jointly save the life of my kind @-@ hearted father .
We also ask the government departments to coordinate with one another and be flexible to activate my father 's medical insurance card and save his life .
After the court verdict is out , all medical costs will be paid back to the medical insurance bureau .
A million thanks to the city residents and media for the concern they have shown us in this incident . May all you kind @-@ hearted people have a life of peace !
Victim 's son
Why helped him up when he was sleeping happily ?
Faint . The social morality system is about to collapse . Everything must be torn down and start all over again . Sigh
Manhunt . Post the pictures of that bunch of perpetrators !
Tragedy
What a turbulent society
Nowadays , to be a good person is really not something you can do casually
Hope the perpetrators can assume the responsibilities
Nowadays , to be a good person is really not something you can do casually . Hope the perpetrators can assume the responsibilities
Sentence all of them to life imprisonment and let 's see if they are going to pay
Poor old man . He 's still stuck in the era of learning from Lei Feng . The society today is a mess .
It 's tough to be a good person !
It 's tough to be a good person !
Punish severely ! It looks like we have to mind our own business !
It is legal as long as three hours of sunshine can be achieved .
Most high @-@ rise buildings with a spacing of 100 meters can certainly achieve that .
Three hours of sunshine , from morning till night , can certainly be achieved .
Most sunlight issues raised by the elderly men and women are indeed not against the national requirements , so they 're merely unreasonable complaints of the elderly as a result of their perceived discomfort .
Even if there is a court judgment confirming that the developer is not against the law , they will still persist with their unreasonable demands .
Reply to Light @-@ and @-@ shadow @-@ hero on the 10 th floor @:
Three hours of sunshine is a technical term . Sunlight analysis is needed . Setbacks of spacing are related to not only the sunshine spacing but also the floor thickness . A sunshine spacing coefficient of 1 @:@ 1.4 can meet the requirement for three hours of sunshine on the day of Great Cold in Taizhou . All we want is that the developer does the job legally , and makes it clear that sunshine analysis has shown that the minimum national requirements can be met !
But what you said is also somewhat reasonable . The minimum standards are not acceptable to most people . They have a good reason to ask for more sunlight . However , this developer is too strong . We just want to secure the minimum legitimate interests according to the national regulations , but even that is so difficult for us !
Guanxi and operations , alas .
I remain poised
China @: There are too many issues now ! Is that because good officials are too few ?
Developers always want to make more money . We have a building here , which has not been pulled down so far even after exposed by CCTV . How powerful the developers are .
The following is a quotation of All owners of Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 's words on the 1 st floor @:
All netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter . Let 's see whether it will ultimately be "@ power over law @" or "@ law over power @" for the officials in General Secretary Hu 's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer ! ...
Uh ... Do you have legislative power or enforcement power ?
In Zhenjiang , Jiangsu , an old man doing morning exercise helped a drunk man up and was mistaken as a thief and badly beaten up
Five young men who work as chefs at Zhenjiang Hotel were strolling on the street in the early morning on the 2 nd after downing several bottles of beer .
One of the men , Ji , squatted on the stone step of a bus stop .
Mr. Yang , an old man from Zhenjiang who is in his 60 s , was passing by while on his morning exercise . After seeing that , he asked Ji to go home soon , and then held out his hands to help Ji up .
However , Ji mistook Mr. Yang for wanting to steal his things , so immediately together with Wu and Ma , he battered the old man violently till he was seriously injured !
Murderers all go for the head !
I think they meant to kill him !
Latest news @: Victim Mr. Yang passed away around 9 a.m. on 9 / 13 / 2011 . Perpetrators remain under criminal detention .

the family of Ma recently again raised 10,000 yuan to pay for surgery .
Hereby , we hope the perpetrators will be able to show resolution in taking on responsibilities and face seriously the mistake that has been committed .
Victim 's family @: As Old Mr. Yang is still in a toxic and unconscious state , he is unable to provide information about what happened at the time of the incident .
Though the three perpetrators have paid 10,000 yuan compensation in total , it is obviously not enough to pay for the current medical costs that are increasing sharply by the day .
Furthermore , in view of the criminal detention time limit , can such punishment have a deterrent effect on the perpetrators ?
How about future medical costs ?
The Yang family hopes to get legal and media assistance .
Associated incidents
The moment this incident came out , this writer could not help but recall the " touch porcelain @" case that happened two years ago !
Cases like the one where "@ a vehicle owner who helped an old lady lying on the ground get up was accused of knocking her down @" all raised a huge uproar across town .
Sometimes , I even doubt the frequency at which such incidents happen , life is getting to really look like fiction !
The society always makes you feel painfully scared . Every day , there always seem to be countless reasons that make people curse .
Let 's not say much . Let 's pray for the injured and hope the perpetrators get punished .
The perpetrators are not going to be held responsible just because they said they are poor ! ?
Who dares to be a Samaritan in future ?
The important thing is to save life !
Are there any solutions ? Provide legal assistance !
Let the law show its might @~
It takes 30 days before public prosecution is initiated . Even day lilies wither by then ! @~
This is actually not about being a Samaritan or not . Many drunkards have lost their consciousness and will get in a drunken fit .
When you want to help , you have to see who it is . If you can n't handle , just call 120 . Sigh ...
Severe punishment still should be given to those who commit crimes after drinking . If not , it will be chaos if everyone pretends to be drunk and bashes up others .
Nowadays , one should not do evil , but one should not do good , either
Such a cup .
The old man was looking for trouble . He should have kept a distance after seeing those drunkards .
Would everyone agree with illegal construction of high @-@ rise buildings ?
Now , in the hometown of our beloved General Secretary Hu , such a strange thing is happening .
Here is the thing @: Shenzhen Maoye Developer has come to Hailing District , Taizhou City , Jiangsu Province for urban construction , and is welcomed by our people .
We do not oppose the construction of high @-@ rise buildings . However , the developer is going to construct a high @-@ rise building against the law . That is what we are resolutely opposed to !
Maoye Developer has planned a high @-@ rise building of 150 m in the Julangchao lot of the old East Station , Hailing District , Taizhou City .
Julangchao used to be the eastern suburbs park , for which many of the old Taizhou people have great affection .
Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 is just located at the back of the Julangchao lot , and now Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 is only about 100 meters from the external walls of the original buildings at the farthest end of the Julangchao lot .
How does the developer meet the national requirement for building setbacks based on a minimum sunshine spacing of 1 @:@ 1.4 in Taizhou ?
Aside from the other sunshine shelters , how can the developer ensure a minimum three hours of sunshine on the day of Great Cold ?
It is certainly not feasible if they want to cheat about the 3 hours technically ,
The plain fact is just in front of us . Moreover , are those few entities the only ones capable of doing sunshine analysis in China ?
We certainly will verify it . A lie will never become the truth !
If the developer can not even give us owners a minimum of three hours on the day of Great Cold in accordance with the national requirement , which has ensured its best interests , how can it give a reasonable and fair explanation to the society , the vast community of netizens and the masses ?
Where are the conscience and morals of the developer ?
We understand that the developer wants to get more benefits , but those are supposed to be legitimate benefits !
On the one hand , such act , if illegally infringing upon other people 's interests , will be detrimental to the reputation and long-term future development of the entire Maoye group . On the other hand , are people whose interests are infringed all fools ?
Will they just let the infringement occur ?
The minimum 3 hours is already difficult to accept . If it is basically an illegal act that makes the fundamental three hours even less , think about it - how will things evolve ?
Finally , the contradictions are bound to intensify , making the situation out of hand .
We hope that the developer can seriously think about this issue , avoid losses and seek its own legal interests through rational development and reasonable development according to law !
If the developer are determined to infringe on our rights and interests , we will surely unite as one to defend our legitimate rights and interests !
The most strange thing is that some people of high rank even agree with the illegal construction of high @-@ rise buildings . We hereby earnestly request the people of high rank who agree with the illegal construction of high @-@ rise buildings to raise their hands and give us a way out !
All netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter . Let 's see whether it will ultimately be "@ power over law @" or "@ law over power @" for the officials in General Secretary Hu 's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer !
All netizens are welcome to look into this matter !
Hello , everyone !
Previously , due to issues about the high @-@ rise buildings on Maoye 's pre @-@ sale renderings and EIA by the Taizhou Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau , the young and old of Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 were neither sleeping nor eating well . Some were depressed , and some were irritated . In short , we felt very angry .
Now Taizhou Municipal Planning Bureau has given us a clear answer that those were simply renderings . Upon verification , the Planning Bureau has requested the developer to make modification . The Bureau will definitely exercise administration according to law , and never approve anything unless it is legal , reasonable and fair ! A forum and a hearing will also be held prior to approval ! A large stone in our hearts has finally dropped onto the ground .
We are moved that in the face of such a huge benefit , our leaders of Taizhou Municipal Government and Taizhou Municipal Planning Bureau have stood unswayed , showing a very noble sentiment and reflecting the characteristics of the Communists in serving the people , which is truly admirable !
All owners of Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 hereby express deep respect and gratitude to Taizhou Municipal Government and Taizhou Municipal Planning Bureau for upholding justice ! People living in Taizhou are happy , thanks to the officials caring for them like their parents !
We thank the government for its concerns over people ! We strongly support for the government administration according to law !
All owners , Pengxinlidu Building No. 14

I hope that the developer does not come to compete against us for sunlight . How do we live without sunlight ?
All netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter . Let 's see whether it will ultimately be "@ power over law @" or "@ law over power @" for the officials in General Secretary Hu 's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer ! For us ordinary people who are like dog shit in this society , it is ridiculous to discuss whether power or law is superior .
I feel really good about that oh oh
What 's the point of law over power ?
It is the powerful that make the final execution .
Yeah , in the real world , we vulnerable groups really feel at a loss as to what to do so often . The power of developers is too great ,
Some relevant government departments just blatantly give the green light to developers against the law and help them fool people !
So we have to frequently ask ourselves @: is the law enacted by this country really useful ?
Is it really capable of restraining developers from grabbing through deceit or by force and illegally obtaining benefits ?
But we can not just watch as the developer take away our sunlight , leaving children and the elderly shivering at home in cold winter . If so , we can n't live a healthy life , nor can we enjoy the warmth of the sun !
Japan had been thinking about invading China for a long time . Would it need the assignment from Russia to decide whether to invade China or not ? Not to mention that the US only acts against the political system of China ? Was it still not enough for Russia to be fooled after 1991 ?
The weapons market in South Asia has been dominated by the hairy country . Though it is weakened by the US weapons market , however , the Russian weapons market still occupies the major portion .
It is not Russia deliberately making use of countries on the South China Sea to besiege China .
Looking at the chaos in the East China Sea and the South China Sea , even thinking with your ass , you will also know that it is the US rather than Russia trying to cause trouble .
Firstly , Russia is not a country with sea power . It has no interest in intervening and meddling in the issues of the East and South China Seas .
Secondly , at present , with the expansion and extrusion of NATO , Russia can hardly protect its own traditional zone of influence . We can say it is busy enough with its own affairs .
And presently , the Asia @-@ Pacific Military Cooperation and NATO are all products of the US 's two @-@ ocean strategy .
After World War I , two systems had taken place . One is the Versailles System in Europe and the Atlantic , and the other was the US @-@ Japanese Washington System in the Far East and the Pacific .
The US stretches over the two oceans , and controls the two systems at the same time .
After World War II , it took control of the two systems respectively , castrating Germany in Europe , and Japan staying alone in Asia to be hermaphrodites , living on by helping the US manufacture electronics and automobile products .
And now , the biggest enemies for the US are such large geopolitical powers in the Old World as Russia and China .
While Russia and the West have no so-called estrangement in ideology and political system , NATO still continues to expand to the east .
And now the Asia @-@ Pacific Military Cooperation is setting up a blockage line and a ring of encirclement around the coastal regions in East and South China .
The coup in Central Asia has not succeeded . Otherwise , once the ring of encirclement is completed , the northern land will cause a headache to you just as the East China Sea and the South China Sea .
Do you still believe that China can become a friend of the US as long as it changes its ideology and system ?
The reasons for China to ally with Russia are that both Russia and China need to heal their wounds from after the disintegration of the Soviet Union and with the savage hegemony of the US .
Solving the existing territorial disputes is an important means of realizing mutual trust . Of course China has made great concessions . There is no other choice .
In fact , unlike China , Russia has neither the policy of reform of opening up nor a good future ( this precious opportunity was seized by China at the historical turning point then , while in Russia , it was ruined by the two idiots at the critical moment . It also shows that the Russians are relatively inferior to the Chinese people in terms of both IQ and EQ ) .
The Russians are bare @-@ footed , so they are not afraid of a China with shoes .
China has enough reasons to make concessions to Russia . China has no fear . China has many opportunities and China has other approaches .
Although Russia is not our friend , we should not turn it into an enemy .
Russia and Japan should not be equated with each other .
To the Chinese people , if Russia wantonly killed Chinese people in China 's traditional area of activities like Japan did , then in the sentiments of ordinary Chinese people , they would hate Russia as much as they hate Japan . However , they did not .
The only case where they wantonly killed Chinese people happened at the end of the Tsing Dynasty . It was the disputable Hailanpao Slaughter .
Thousands or tens of thousands , the number is just a small proportion even compared with the population of the Manchu .
It can even be ignored if compared with the Chinese population of nearly 400 million . Can it be equated with Japan 's massacre of Chinese people in the populated North and Southeast of China ?
Besides , Russia is a European country with its strategic focus in the west . The Far East is never its focus .
If the Russians really want to seriously take China as their arch enemy , they should strive to construct the Far East .
However , nowadays , with its own serious problems , it continues to abandon the Far East and many cities have become heaps of ruins .
It shows that Russia 's strategic focus has been in the west , addressing the expansion of NATO . Only traitors will be advocating hostile relations between China and Russia here .
The US can pose a greater threat and impact upon China than Russia , especially in the core area of China .
The reasons are simple . Russia is a European country . The Far East is not its focus , while the US is a country in the Asia @-@ Pacific region .
Do you know the theory of sea control ? Nowadays , is there more influence from the US or Russia in the issues of the Taiwan Straits and the South China Sea and the Far East ? It is the US ! This is clear proof !
Do you think that territorial waters are n't territory ? In modern times , the strategic and economic values of territorial waters are much more than those of land territories . One can only become a strong power and have a say in the international community by controlling the sea .
Why was it not China , its neighbor , but instead Great Britain , separated by vast oceans , that made India into a colony ?
Nowadays , Russia has serious problems itself . Its armaments are quite obsolete , and the living conditions for its people are extremely adverse . The population has faced a sharp reduction .
The national elites all know the home country is hopeless , so they all run abroad .
It has become common practice for women to marry foreigners , and many of them come to China and become prostitutes .
Even the productivity of the population is seriously lacking . It is impossible for it to constitute a threat to China .
And nowadays the US is besieging and containing China openly with a view of disrupting China .
Why leave the current problems unsolved , but seize on Russia , which has no ability to pose a threat to China at present ?
When it comes to that Russia occupied China 's territory , that is another story like the Japanese did . Japan wanted to invade the whole country of China , but can Russia do that ?
Russia is a European country with its strategic focus on the west , rather than the Far East . Its expansion to the Far East in history was also partly non @-@ governmental and partly governmental .
Japan is separated from China only by a strait , with the spacious Pacific behind it . There is no menace from the rear if it invades China with all its strength . Can Russia do that ?
Even if Russia puts a little bit more energy into the issues of China and the Far East , can it ignore the affairs in Europe ?
Moreover , we would rather say that Russia has availed itself of opportunities , than to say that it had invaded and occupied China 's territories .
At that time , those places were far away from China 's traditional living area . China 's exploration was a little bit later at that time . There have been few inhabitants around those places in history .
At that time , those places were bitterly cold places covered with waist @-@ deep snows . So we pay no heed to them .
Although when it comes to now , these places are of great economic and strategic importance . However , at that time we did n't discover that ; therefore , at that time even the ruler of China paid no heed to the places , and sent no immigrants there for quite a long time .
Just like today 's oceans . From the perspective of today , they have huge economic values , so territorial waters are also important territories .
However , in the past , they were not discovered . And territorial waters were not regarded as territories . They even exercised trade prohibition on the sea area and closed the coastlines .
Yet the Russians availed themselves of a favorable geological location to occupy those places ahead of us . The Russians were just availing themselves of opportunities .
At that time , it was a time when big powers established colonies everywhere . Unlike today , when the behavior of all countries are bound by international laws .
Other big powers had to capture colonies by war . For example , it was through war that Britain and Japan occupied Hong Kong and Taiwan respectively .
However , the Russians got such a big place without much effort . That was because the ruler of China did n't care for the unexplored places .
They just availed themselves of opportunities . Things such as territory are hard to talk about .
If it was your imminent area of activity , it might be justifiable .
However , if it was a place that you did n't send immigrants to explore for a long period throughout history , and was taken by others because of a favorable geographical location and convenient access , then as time goes by it would be hard to say , after a certain length of time .
It would be barely passable for you to claim it to be yours . This is totally different from Japan . Can Russia launch a barbaric war of aggression to occupy China 's imminent territories like Japan did ?
Can it provoke * to invade northeast China and launch an all @-@ out war of aggression against China because northeast China had become an imminent territory of China like northern China with the arrival and exploration of large number of immigrants from inside Shanhaiguan Pass ? It is impossible .
The opinions of the writer Wuhan Tuo La Ji Shou on the upper floor are brilliant ! However , by reversing the order of "@ subjugation of the nation @" and "@ elimination of the entire race , @" would it be in line with the historical facts ?
Right now Russia is clamoring "@ to build India into the top military power in Asia . @" Putin personally sealed the arms sale deal to sell India advanced weapons such as aircraft carriers , nuclear @-@ powered submarines , T50 fighters and BrahMos missiles ... Even the weapons it sells to Vietnam are more advanced than those it sells to China . And it only sells China big airplanes and carrier aircraft . Its wild ambitions are thoroughly exposed !
It is a pity that the present dynasty are national scum supported by the Soviet Union ! While the yellow Russians are prevailing , what else can the grass-root folks do ?
It seems that all Chinese hate Japanese , and I am not an exception . However , has everybody thought it over that it was Russia who stirred up the war between China and Japan for fear that China would reclaim territories from it ? It was also Russia that went between the Communist Party and the KMT and was able to achieve success one way or the other . And at the end of the war of resistance , it then stirred up the civil war , and lured China to get involved in the Korean War . If Stalin was still alive , China would have more trouble !
Even if it has propped up an agent in China , it is still concerned about China . And in the 21 st century , it continues to play little tricks of provoking anti @-@ Chinese sentiments . It sold weapons to Vietnam and checked and seized the cargos of Chinese merchants . Its crimes are so numerous that bamboo strips would be exhausted before they could all be recorded .
What is regretful is that our government deals with such kind of things in different ways . If the US or Japan does so , Mr. Qin Gang and Ms. Jiangyu would absolutely deliver a so-called just and severe statement of condemnation . Yet with regard to the incident of the Chinese boatmen who were shot by Russia , there was not even a protest presented . And it became an incident with no definite results in the year 2009 .
The greatest threat of subjugation of the nation comes from Russia . In history , countries being eliminated by this nation were as many as the stars in the sky . Moreover , in the history of China , almost all geographical threats came from the north .
The greatest threat of "@ elimination of the entire race @" comes from Japan . The seed of national hatred is indelible . Once discharged accidentally , it would not be just territorial conflicts , but a massacre .
The greatest threat of downfall of D comes from the US . The dramatic contrast of ideology causes the US to treat all dictating Ds in the world as targets to be removed .
However , there is no need to worry that he would have any claims for territory .
The greatest threat to the economy comes from the EU . The EU frequently takes the opportunity of trade or human right conflicts between China and the US to grab a large portion of the market , and squeezes the surplus values . Now it has become our biggest trading partner .
Personally I think the geopolitical environment of China is quite adverse . However , Just as what the floor host said , the real threat comes from Russia .

Do you think nowadays that Russia still has the capacity to do that ?
If the Communist Party of China does not put the practical interests of the people first , but continues to tolerate the corrupt governments , the people would lose their faith in the Party , and in the near future it could hardly be avoided that the territories of China would be divided by an alliance of the US and Russia !
It was foreseeable that they have put their hands into our neighboring countries , and they have instigated pressures on our country from all sides . Has n't the government in power run by the Communist Party been claiming to be strong ? And now it is time for you to bring your wisdom into play @~
The Sino @-@ Japanese war and the civil war of China were stirred up by Russia , and Russia has the ability to force China to send troops to North Korea ? Nonsense !
For China , China and United States have the biggest relationship in the world , and the Sino @-@ US relationship is a trade @-@ off relationship .
In the most recent visit to the US by Xi Jinping , which is an exercise before he becomes the top official in China , the primary topic discussed was mutually beneficial economic cooperation of the two sides .
The Sino @-@ US relationship is very complicated . Economically , the two sides are partners on unequal footings ,
politically , it is a relationship between socialism and capitalism ; militarily , Chinese and US militaries are in an isolated state .
Therefore , currently China is playing games with the United States , i.e. how to offset the latter two relationships with economic cooperation .
Next is a brief analysis of the main strategy of Xi Jinping 's visit to the US @:
First , what is the biggest puzzle between China and the US ?
The biggest puzzle in front of China is how to maintain its relationship with the US as it becomes increasingly powerful .
To China , it can not fall out with the US .
If China falls out with the US , then it will seriously consumes China 's strengths and will be very unfavorable for future development of China ,
because China will lose the situation of peaceful development internationally , such that China has to cope with not only the powerful military threat posed by the US , but also complicated relations in the neighboring areas . This will seriously consume China energy for development .
Therefore , on the premise of not falling out with the US , China , on the one hand , still has to maintain relationship with the US , while on the other hand , it has to precaution against the dirty tricks that the US plays on China .
Second , it is not time yet to be tough to the US .
Some believe that China should be tough to the US . Is the US someone that yields to hawkishness ?
In the Soviet Union era , it got in a race for hegemony against the US , where both sides were so tough that they became enemies , which provided the US the opportunity to break up thoroughly with the Soviet Union .
As the US does not need the USSR to exist as a great power , the US could attack the USSR and tackle the USSR without any hesitation .
The road China is going along at present is one where the two sides are intertwined with each other , such that the US also suffers great loss when attacking and imposing sanctions on China .
What 's more , many businesspeople in the US also come out to oppose the government 's behaviors . China will be able to truly rise as long as it can keep on for ten years .
As the ancient saying goes , a gentleman can afford to wait for as long as ten years to avenge . If China falls out with the US too early , it will put itself in a very disadvantaged position .
Although we are strong today , it 's not time yet to fight the final battle with the US .
Third , the two phases that the Sino @-@ US relationship will go through .
It is not advisable to fight a major war in the China 's dealings with the US .
The author believes the two sides could only undergo two phases . The first one is a period which sees China grow in strength and the US feel seriously threatened .
The second stage is when China has become strong , the US is no longer certain about winning a war with China , such that it has no choice than to cooperate in order to obtain more benefits .
To avoid war between China and the US , it appears extremely important to carry out exchanges between the two peoples .
Next let 's have a look at survey results of Americans view towards China @:
An opinion poll of a US website shows that 6 % of the people believe China and the US are "@ allies , @" 69 % think they are "@ friendly but not allies , @" and 4 % believe they are "@ enemies . @"
Survey results also show that 71 % of the Americans believe Sino @-@ US relations are "@ very important or somewhat important , @" while the proportion is 85 % in opinion leaders .
On the 14 th , the Washington Post said that in an opinion poll it conducted jointly with the American Broadcasting Company , 52 % of the respondents saw China in a negative way .
This result reflects two urgent issues . First , China is not that bad in the mind of American people , and there is still environment and scope to continue expanding exchanges .
Second , if China and the US do not handle their relations properly , lacking in communications between its peoples and the foundation or friendship , then the Chinese and American peoples may turn hostile .
Therefore , the Chinese and American peoples must enhance cooperation and bring the two sides closer through economic cooperation , so as to offset the discrepancies brought by military and politics .
However , it is undeniable that serious conflicts remain between China and the US in some important areas .
For instance @: the Taiwan issue ; human rights and democracy ; North Korea ; Iran ; proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; Pakistan ; geopolitics and military strategy ; trade and currency ; intellectual property rights and internet spies .
These puzzles can not be overcome with the two characters of friendship alone . After all it involves major interests .
So it is no secret to the two sides . Just like Vice President Xi Jinping counts on the US to oppose Taiwan independence and Tibetan , how could China count on a geopolitical enemy ?
National presidents are all masters in politics , who know what 's at stake . However , what should be said should be said . The thing is if the US has said something , it will break its words if it does n't do what it said , which will show to people in the world that the US is immoral and its words do n't count .
Anyway , between China and the US in the future , whoever is a better strategist and whoever comes up with more sophisticated strategy wins .
It requires wisdom to be friends with an enemy . You can only fight a hundred wars without defeat only if you know yourself and the enemy well .
This view tells us a fact that one will earn respect by developing military force
The cannons are thicker
It requires wisdom to be friends with an enemy . You can only fight a hundred wars without defeat only if you know yourself and the enemy well .
Chairman Mao has said a long time ago @: one will be beaten if he / she is backward . Only development is of overriding importance !
It is fun ? They are ordering the dog they feed at home to bark at you , yet you have gone to shake hands with them , looking for slaps

Brainwash the Chinese people on behalf of the Americans .
Brainwash the Chinese people on behalf of the Americans .
Is it the American system that 's superior or the Chinese system that 's superior after all ?
I think Taiwan and the mainland are already distinguishing relative superiority or inferiority between them . The thread starter should take a look outside the country more
You look but not see the ZG 's chaos in society , or is it voluntary blindness !
I also feel that there are more modern "@ traitors of China @" than during WWII .
Everyone has eyes , look at the living situations of North Korea and South Korea - do you still not understand ?
Venture exchange ,
If I take care of myself , that 's good enough , when the country needs me , I 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness
If these traitors of China existed around 50 , 60 years ago , they would already have been executed by firing squad .
To make a conclusion , you must have something to demonstrate it
I do n't have time to go searching
I wish LZ would explain them one by one ...
Their property and families are all outside of the country , of course they will , just like the officials .
when the country needs me , I 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness
I can just take a look , and dare not to speak my mind , the police can grab people , thread starter , I admire you for daring to speak ! Bump !
The ruling authorities actually should pay attention to these kinds of capitulators and traitors of China !
Comrade Deng Xiaoping once said that the Communist Party will not be overthrown - if it falls , it will be brought down from within the party itself .
Former US Ambassador to China Mr. Huntsman once said in a speech in the US @: we will raise eight hundred thousand spokespeople in China , let the Chinese themselves topple China -
and the CIA then used an annual eight million yuan subsidy to help these domestic so-called elite , vowing that they want to let them raise the wind to make waves domestically , citizens definitely need to be alert for this and can not let outsiders use us .
There are many who have a sense of urgency , quietly watching how things develop , you are dragons coiling , you are tigers crouching , I admire noble @-@ minded patriots .
Has history given us too many lessons ? , 530 , 412 , 64
taking a look
the ones who are suffering are the ordinary people @: even if the body of a salted fish is turned over , it is still a salted fish ...
Freedom of speech \ thought , if people express a view somewhat different than the traditional view , and put forward slightly different criticism , then they are called slaves of foreigners , or are accused of reverence for and fascination by foreign things ,
What is more they are considered traitors of China , which is a fact of cultural tyranny in the cloak of nationalism and patriotism .
In fact , the US no longer needs to use force to deal with China , they have achieved the result of "@ defeating enemy soldiers without fighting @" .
Is the article too intense , is the United States so good ?
If things are not seen by eyes and heard by ears yourself , do not assume their existence , three people create a tiger .
Just passing by and taking a look . Will n't express my opinion
Came to study and learn
Very attractive
It should vigorously advocated
Some people - do n't forget you are Chinese ; if the country needs me , I 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness !
I really especially hate those who are eating Chinese things and drinking Chinese things , but who say America is so whatever , those dogs , if America is so good go find your American illegitimate fathers
I feel our people should learn more from the DPRK , the banner of socialism needs to be held , but Mao Zedong Thought can n't be forgotten !
Only Mao Zedong Thought , can save the nation !
There too many traitors of China !
Patriotism is the bottom line . Everyone must prove worthy of the nation
I think it is not those elites , but that some corrupt officials were bribed
Remove this group of jerks !
I 'm just taking a look
There are so many traitors in the history of China - we need to be vigilant .
With the chaos in East and North Africa , we also had no choice but to prevent the running dog traitors from colluding with Western imperialism .
Everything has its set number , it 's not time for a change in the weather in China , traitors can only bark madly like dogs and nothing else , can only make them disappointed .
It will n't be long until people are coming from all directions to the Chinese court . Leading the world . This is the intent of heaven .
Following with interest .
This just is a specialty of modern China there 's nothing we can do
There are too many traitors among our compatriots ,
Freedom of speech is relative . We need take national conditions into account .
Freedom of speech \ thought , if people express a view somewhat different than the traditional view , and put forward slightly different criticism , then they are called slaves of foreigners , or are accused of reverence for and fascination by foreign things ,
to the person who said this I 'd like to ask which one of those mentioned above is your dad

In critical moments , we are all descendants of Yan emperor and Huang emperor .
Look at the Kuomintang @-@ Communist cooperation of those years and you will know ...
In the peaceful years , creating a ruckus does n't influence everybody cooperating when it 's time for war ...
It can compete with articles from the Cultural Revolution , magnifying a problem to become a question of principle or of ideological line , buttoning the hat .
the fifth column will make those with vested interests in the Communist Party terrified , it 's a good thing

Former US Ambassador to China Mr. Huntsman once said in a speech in the US @: we will raise eight hundred thousand spokespeople in China , let the Chinese themselves topple China - and the CIA then used an annual eight million yuan subsidy to help these domestic so-called elite , vowing that they want to let them raise the wind to make waves domestically , citizens definitely need to be alert for this and can not let outsiders use us .
I have reasons to say this @: these last several days I have seen the suggestions given by the experts - with a glimpse I see they are disciples of Wang Jingwei !
Western society allows these people to see the dawn of fairness and justice of democracy .
The domestic political development is truly too slow , being criticized by people whose ideology is a bit advanced is inevitable . Can we blame others for this ?
Saying that someone is bribed is improper ?
People are all selfish , reality also is often gray .
Some propaganda activities of ZF have soon become viewed as jokes by the people .
In this environment , what 's wrong if they criticize the previous stupefying propaganda a bit ?
We can n't look over the old accounts of the previous so-called anti @-@ Japanese war .
Take a look at North Korea , that 's our country many years ago . Take a look at their ridiculous propaganda .
The United States @' dream of occupying the whole world has never stopped , it is constantly being planned .
These days , there 's a kind of feeling that 's more and more intense @: It 's that America , through long-term bribing of the Chinese intellectual elite has already succeeded in setting up a "@ fifth column @" .
These people may consider themselves to be culture celebrities or may be of high authority and important position , and are distributed in various circles in society , taking great pains to promote American values @* and brainwash the Chinese people on behalf of the Americans .
Why is this kind of feeling getting more and more intense ?
Because these days , I 've been reading part of the "@ Specialist Professor @" blog , it would have been okay if I did n't read it , but after I read it , it made me really surprised .
For example , Assistant Professor Zhang Ming of Renmin University , the political intentions of many of his blogs are extremely obvious .
Such as , in one blog he attributed the reason for the prevalence of hostility in China to elementary school textbooks having "@ Wang Erxiao @" , and he disparaged good articles that promote patriotism as not even worth a penny .
Another example is so-called "@ sexologist @" and "@ social activist @" Li Yinhe - one , her stuff is not similar to things like the treatise "@ Haite Sexology Report @" ; two , she has no deep thought ; and three , she has no significant contributions .
She main relies on doing something novel and different and on shocking viewpoints to attract people 's eyes , but without real ability or learning , she 's purely a jumping clown ,
This kind of person puts on the big "@ specialist @" hat just to intimidate people ; the key is that she is concerned about politics yet does n't understand politics , is willing to be a slave of foreigners yet is arrogant and overbearing , is ignorant yet feels fine .
Like in the essay "@ A bit less hostility , a bit more harmony @" , she completely denigrates class struggle and the anti @-@ pornography @-@ and @-@ illegal @-@ publications drive as social hostility ;
in the essay "@ China has already become the country which worships money most on the earth @" , she attributes Chinese society 's worship of money to atheism ;
the essay "@ Are you studying Paul or studying Bill ? @" , she blathers that "@ people who study Paul will become terrorists @" ;
in the essay "@ Recommendation for establishment of a constitutional court to solve the problem of pornographic products @" , she takes citizens publishing pornographic novels to be freedom of speech , and says the Beijing anti @-@ pornography drive is unconstitutional behavior , etc.
Especially today 's masterpiece , "@ Why is it worth paying such close attention to the Jianghe obscene goods case ? @" , where she is once again crying foul over several people suspected of involvement in erotic business activities who are being dealt with by Beijing City , as well as detailing a list of erotic products , with a deeper intent of doing publicity for other people . @"
But these kind of jerky articles actually being put on top by Sina blog is really preposterous !
And there is also Sichuanese poet Liu Shahe , who , while America clear to the eye and with swelling gall engages in containment of China and the people of the whole nation are feeling indignant , actually comes out with the fallacy "@ China and America are friendly @" , and tries to pour spirit @-@ confusing soup on the Chinese people willfully and without fear ;
Yi Zhongtian , who got famous by remarking upon the "@ three countries @" , whose talent and learning I have always respected , but I did n't expect that he was actually supporting the big traitor of China , Mao Yushi , saying some things like "@ I believe whoever disrespects Mao Yushi is not human @" , once again making me very much drop my glasses !
Also , as for the rumor on the internet a short time ago "@ Complete notes on 100 Chinese celebrities who accepted political contributions from the Ford Foundation @" , I feel that the segment of the intellectual elite in China who are "@ becoming treasonous @" are increasingly ardent and have already become willful and without fear , to a level of publicly harming the country .
But I do not understand , when these people frequently make treasonous remarks , why no one curbs them and they , moreover , can continue to occupy high positions , calling the wind and rousing the rain among the intelligentsia and in public opinion ?
Contacting "@ Southern newspapers @" , which were temporarily fierce a short while ago , I feel that part of the intellectual elite have possibly sunk together with media personalities !
I remember , 60 @-@ some years ago the US had just fought a war with China , and still threatened China with the use of nuclear weapons ;
40 @-@ some years ago , the US entered Vietnam with the intention of containing China ;
although 32 years ago it had established relations with China , 22 years ago it again started imposing sanctions on China , 12 years ago it bombed a Chinese embassy , 10 years ago the South China Sea collision incident occurred , and two years ago it restarted its containment of China with great fanfare .
I do n't understand , why are we Chinese so forgetful ?
Why are there still so many people ignoring their conscience and speaking on the behalf of the US ?
Without taking a big loss , people do n't improve their abilities to remember - this is possibly the greatest weakness of us Chinese .
Therefore , it also stands to reason that the forces of the traitors of China are rampaging and the fifth column is running rampant
It 's entirely possible - do n't we ourselves raise "@ traitors to China @" among primary school students ?
It 's entirely possible - do n't we ourselves raise "@ traitors to China @" among primary school students ?

Mr. Zhengqing , the things you say are quite astonishing , there possibly is a suspicion that there are fragments , even if they are a fifth column , they would n't be so bare @-@ boned , we should allow the existence of different opinions , the times are really different , no matter if its democracy or pan @-@ Occidentalism , neither are beneficial to China , do n't be afraid , what do you say

Love our China , boycott Japanese goods
The Chinese government is incompetent , sooner or later it will collapse !
Give me five hundred thousand elite soldiers and I will make Japan flat in half a year !
China , no matter how much you exercise forbearance , there is nobody who will say good words about you , and others will still bully you as usual
My husband is a veteran . He said if a war takes place , he would stand in the very frontline of the war - rather die on the war field than live on in degradation
The Diaoyu Islands are ours , are n't they ? Um ... Yes , it seems like they were , but now some say they were , some say they were n't . Bit of a mess . Or talk about the matter of development first ?
Let 's do this , once again , listen carefully @: The Diaoyu Islands are whose ? Are whose ? Are whose ?
Oh , yours ? Or his ? Say it , hurry up and say it , shout it out , hurry up and shout the Diaoyu Islands are yours !
Ah , you see you see , they started to catch people , run fast , do n't shout any more , run , beat whoever shouts again .
I 'll ask again whose the Diaoyu Islands are , but do n't shout loud , discuss this matter in a gentlemanly fashion
Oh , let me explain a bit , the Diaoyu Islands did not ever exist . This is a misunderstanding , misunderstanding , misunderstanding heh heh
It should be called , called , called the Senkaku Islands , heh heh the Senkaku Islands , good good , so it seems the Diaoyu Islands issue does not exist any more
Just call them the Senkaku Islands , cheers , for wisely solving the Diaoyu ... ah no , the Senkaku Islands matter , ( ⊙ _ ⊙ )
In a joyful , harmonious , friendly , and peaceful atmosphere , it came to an complete ending .
Who is shouting again outside , go , all disperse , do n't gather and watch any more , things whose nature has been decided , will n't be changed any more ?
That is not good . How can we speak in such a untrustworthy manner , we are a responsible big country - let the matter be , do not mention it again , to develop the economy is of overriding importance .
Why are you still not leaving , all of you get out , OK , you will n't go , right ? call 110 and have plainclothes police move in , uh . ? Still not dispersed , OK , it seems it will n't work if I do n't real weapons , armed police , steel army , come on , if it does n't work , pull out the Third Artillery Troops , fire . .
Sweep the floor sweep the floor we are about to do cleaning , to welcome the next dawn
Dammit ! The Manchu government still charged while holding a kitchen knife ! How about now ? Oh ! Is our ZF protesting ? I believe there are n't any damn Japanese ordinary people who do n't support it . Hey , ZF ! It 's time to wake up . The ordinary people are all making fists ...
1 . Establish guaranteed funds , improve working environment and mechanisms , recruit back to China the hundreds of thousands of IT professionals who have emigrated to and linger in the United States and around the world .
2 . Create a few nuclear @-@ powered aircraft carrier battle groups .
3 . Manufacture 5000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds .
4 . Accelerate the research and deployment of high @-@ speed intercontinental ballistic missiles which can break missile defense systems and whose range is more than 10,000 nautical miles .
5 . Resume nuclear experiments , and establish military forces in space .
6 . Retain 1000 nuclear bombs equivalent to ten million tons of TNT , and when necessary , install nuclear warheads on all short @- and middle @-@ range missiles .
7 . Retain 30 strategic nuclear submarines with the ability to inflict three devastating nuclear strikes against enemies .
8 . Abandon the commitment to not use nuclear weapons first .
9 . Retain the right of pre @-@ emptive strike when national security is threatened .
It does n't matter much when you open your mouth , but how about money , do you really think China is very strong ?
The government is incompetent to this point !
Invade and occupy openly China 's sacred territory , "@ the Diaoyu Islands @" , defying world opinion .
Our China is a country governed with protocol . We do n't want to bother ourselves arguing with the likes of that small country ... really TMD disgusting
Resolutely support the thread starter ! I compose a poem in reply @:
Pledge to fight to the death defending the Diaoyu Islands and the related islands
Fleets bumping fishing boats . Little evil Japanese ghosts stirring up trouble and unrest . With hearts of thieves and arrogant form , they again show their wolfish appearance
Never go back to that time , our humiliating appearance when signing the treaties . China be strong , swords be sharp and knives be shining , let 's bury the approaching enemies !
September 11 th , 2010
I agree with the analysis of the thread starter , resolutely bump up . If war really comes , I would like to be Hua Mulan , to protect our home and defend our homeland , to spread the prestige of our China , to pledge to fight to the death defending our national dignity .
I very much wish I had been born in those passionate and upsurging times of Mao Zedong , the Long March , losing my head and shedding my blood , completely extinguishing all the enemies that wrong China , spreading our dragon prestige !
How Long are We Going to Tolerate Japan ?
My fellow citizens @:
Hello , everyone ! We all know the "@ September 18 th @" Incident , but now Japan again has a premeditated plan for another "@ September 18 th @" on the sea , another "@ Lugou Bridge on the sea @" .
Japan surprisingly defied the strong condemnation of the whole world , openly invaded our country 's sacred territory , "@ the Diaoyu Islands @" .
As we all know , the "@ Diaoyu Islands @" have always belonged to China ; due to historical reasons , what originally belongs us has become controversial .
My fellow citizens , ours is ours , what need is there to negotiate ! Japan thus goes even further - wants to create a fact of occupation . Can we allow this ? No - absolutely not !
My fellow citizens , Japan 's militarism has brought the people of Asia grave disasters .
Especially China suffered the ravages of Japan for as long as several decades .
In the Northeast , Japanese Unit 731 cruelly conducted human body experiments on living people of China , Korea and other countries , the method of which were extremely brutal ; the Nanjing Massacre added a layer of blood to the ancient capital which will never fade away ; the big bloody battles at Hengyang and Changsha laid bare the bones of the dead over a thousand kilometers and killed off everything ...
My fellow citizens , of the heinous crimes committed by Japan in China , there are too many instances to cite , difficult to record without exhausting all bamboo strips .
It 's just as if those ten million deceased souls who lost their lives are wandering over the Pacific Ocean , finding it difficult to rest in peace .
All the people who experienced that era must still remember it vividly ; even our younger generations also will cry with tears streaming down our cheeks , and our blood boils with indignation , whenever we turn to this page of history and read !
Now Japan actually wants to reverse the verdict on the history of its aggression - fellow citizens , fellow Chinese in Asia , wake up !
Although it is painful to look back at these hundred years of shame , we must go face it ; although historical issues have not been resolved , let us create and choose history !
Since there is responsibility , we are not afraid . The territory is small , but it is related to the matter of dignity ; no matter how the winds and clouds changes , the interests of the country and national unity are the guarantee of honor ; even though scarred with wounds , we can not let our native lands be separated !
My fellow citizens , for the Chinese nation , the advent of the twenty @-@ first century means a time when we are beset with difficulties inside while being pressed from outside , and we will face many challenges .
The Taiwan issue , the Tibet issue , the South China Sea issue , the surrounding environment , as well as the foreign forces which are aggressive to China - which way should we go ?
What to do , fellow citizens ? Please take a look at the map of the world , that crescent @-@ shaped encirclement is suppressing our breathing , strangling our development , and coveting our national territory .
We do not want to make enemies , but are never afraid of enemies ; we do not want war , but are never afraid of war .
We must urgently arrange arms , strengthen all military forces on land , on sea , and in the air .
Over thousands of years , the Chinese nation has flourished several times , but before it has never had ambition to expand its territory outward .
Not imposing on others what we do n't want ourselves , what we follow is a foreign security strategic philosophy which applies benevolence and virtue .
The tolerance and liberalness of a country are like those of an individual - we avoid hurting others , but must insist on not being hurt ourselves .
Tolerance is certainly not fear , and sincerity does not have to be cowardice .
China exempting Japan from war reparations for World War II was in service of peace , benevolent peace .
My fellow citizens , the People 's Heroes Monument is a condensed history of the Chinese nation striving for continuous self @-@ improvement
The solemn and magnificent posture represents a sacred expectation for peace .
The thought @-@ strings of my memory have been agitated from time to time - many heroic , stirring , and tragic scenes of shining spears and armored horses spring up in my mind .
My thoughts go through those yellowing pages of history , as if I saw Emperor Kangxi , the famous ruler of a generation , contemplating alone about how to achieve unification of the territory in his audience hall , hundreds of years ago ; also as if I saw Abraham Lincoln , former U.S. President , wandering alone in the dark of a great hall , thinking about the integrity of the Union .
"@ Although it is peaceful throughout the world , it is certainly dangerous to forget war ! @" My fellow citizens , we want development and peace , but we must never exercise forbearance blindly . The "@ Boxer Protocol " of national betrayal and humiliation has aggravated China 's poverty and backwardness in modern time - falling behind will lead to being bullied .
Without strength , where does peace come from !
We must focus on national defense education , build up a Great Wall in the hearts of 1.3 billion people , and must establish the full range of a national defense system having the ability to both attack and defend ;
The best defense is to attack - we should strengthen forces which can engage in ultra @-@ long @-@ range attack , improve combat capability throughout all of aerospace , of great depth , and over great distances . On the premise of avoiding influence on national economic development , increase investment and construction of the defense industry , accelerate modernization and internationalization of military equipment , and establish a high @-@ quality , high-tech elite division .
The battle horn is about to sound , the people are already fully equipped and ready to go .
Without the people 's support we will accomplish nothing ; with the support of the people , we will be all @-@ powerful .
My fellow citizens , it is time for us to say "@ no @" to others . Therefore , we must achieve @:
1 . Establish guaranteed funds , improve working environment and mechanisms , recruit back to China the hundreds of thousands of IT professionals who have emigrated to and linger in the United States and around the world .
2 . Create a few nuclear @-@ powered aircraft carrier battle groups .
3 . Manufacture 5000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds .
4 . Accelerate the research and deployment of high @-@ speed intercontinental ballistic missiles which can break missile defense systems and whose range is more than 10,000 nautical miles .
5 . Resume nuclear experiments , and establish military forces in space .
6 . Retain 1000 nuclear bombs equivalent to ten million tons of TNT , and when necessary , install nuclear warheads on all short @- and middle @-@ range missiles .
7 . Retain 30 strategic nuclear submarines with the ability to inflict three devastating nuclear strikes against enemies .
8 . Abandon the commitment to not use nuclear weapons first .
9 . Retain the right of pre @-@ emptive strike when national security is threatened .
My fellow citizens , only if we have self @-@ confidence and self @-@ improvement , can we strive to be strong . Qin Shi Huang unified China . Zheng Chenggong recovered Taiwan . In our responsibilities we must carry on the farsightedness , insight , and strong will of our predecessors .
Now , that piece of land trembling far away from the embrace of the motherland is shaking , moaning , and calling . Fellow citizens , let us carry forward the unfulfilled wishes of previous generals , moving forward courageously !
When reading over history , the heaviness and anger in my heart simmer into concern for the nation . Although I was born to cloth gown and am one of the common people , for the prosperity of the motherland , for the motherland being splendid once again , I am willing to voluntarily serve our country , and I will have no regrets even if I die ! My sincere patriotic heart is adequate to show to heaven !
Here , I 've composed a poem in classical ci form , to voice the aspirations of my heart .
Paint the deep red lips
Protect the Diaoyu Islands
Bitterly lost our Ryukyu Islands
How can we allow the Diaoyu Islands to fall to other countries
One hundred years of vicissitudes
Smoke and clouds chase the flying waves
Youngest brother is still a tender youth
Wandering in all directions , bearing a seal
Looking over to the flag
Brandish our weapons and cross to the east
Let the horses drink from the Pacific Ocean

Why do n't we fight with little Japan ?
What do Chinese still tolerate ...
They are riding even on our head
Is this still what Chinese with guts do ?
We should tell the whole world , that Chinese can n't be bullied at will by others ...
It is time to show our strength ! China has been calm for too long !
Currently our citizens @' lives are all too carefree ! The officials are too extravagant .
Now we already have no cohesion ! China needs to start a war ! A harsh slap in the face of the countries which follow the United States @' rear !
Let them know that the US is not a panacea ! If we win , it may increase China 's influence ! and improve the cohesion of the citizenry ! If we lose , we can clean out those incompetent bureaucrats , and make those trash get out ! Let China have new blood and get updated . , Get up , China !
Go , China , go
I suggest that China strengthens the guard on the Diaoyu Islands , make it daily , protect the fishermen and the sovereignty of our country ; if Japan dares to invade our territory with military force , we will fight a small-scale war of self @-@ defense , regardless of the cost . China can not lose !
We need shows in life , but it is really p . to show yourself within someone 's embrace .
I 'm just passing by
The whole society is like this , not to mention the stars
Damn it being not sexy
It 's totally unacceptable
Agree , just cheap entertainers . Their reputation in feudal China somewhat makes sense .
Their life looks glorious
a group of people of nine professions
Life is hard .
:shocked:
That 's normal , it has always been the case that a whore is heartless and a performer is unrighteous
They want money , not the face
Have a look at the "@ wolf with glasses @" near Ms. Fan , you will know the actress has no choice but drink with him or she will be forced out or even framed .
SOB
It 's ok as long as there is something to eat :loveliness @:
No one is easy . Life is like a show , you must have a look at the script to know how to perform
All are SB
There are top scorer in the Imperial Examination in all 360 walks of life ! What effort and endeavor behind those top scorer in the Imperial Examination ! This is humiliating the word " bean vermicelli @" !
Haha
Overdoing
The reality
Shoot those hooligans
Cheap performers
Cheap performers !
The entertainment circle is a dirty one , all men in it are birds and beasts and scum
Pity them , but who is to blame ? Those female stars are not easy
Everybody is doing this , how can you make money if you do n't do this
She is a proud woman in front of others but is in melancholy mood when staying alone ...
To put it plainly stars nowadays are just popular prostitutes in ancient times . Now that they are famous prostitutes , it should be just normal to drink with some high officials or even sleep with them
Stop talking about others just behave yourself
What should we do in the future ! Ability alone is n't enough to become successful ! Are we goin @' to face such hard choices too ?
More suffering is under the disguise of glorious looks , it is the undisputable fact .
It 's not so bad , they 're just playing in their own circle , out of sight , out of mind ,
Not like the old guy Zhang Jizhong not only behaved like a hooligan in his own circle , but also thinks he is virtuous without any talent . He makes TV series when he has nothing to do to wreck people of the whole country .
Both take what they need
When can China have a pure , innocent girl ?
A story is now very shocking in the entertainment world . It is rumored that Hsu Yuki has been forced out because she refused to drink with a guest as arranged by the company and has to switch to work as a lawyer 's assistant instead to make ends meet .
Much envied super stars often encounter social engagements or circumstances which they do n't welcome but have to join in ,
After all , there are many things they can n't decide themselves 'cause that will have to do with many aspects and the interests of many people ,
Sometimes a dinner party which seems very normal for us ordinary people may not be that simple for stars as we imagined .
A star will have lots of contracts and her source of money will be rolling if she tackles well ; If she does n't tack well , what comes after her heel would be forcing out or even frame @-@ ups ...
There are two kinds of smart female stars . Those of the first kind always hold very high integrity and sternly reject all such invitations ;
the second kind are good at playing the trick and making their objectives achieved with their seed money ,
It 's rumored that even some super female stars won their first roles in this way .
After drinking some alcohol , the advertiser or show sponsor may take the chance to lie on the female star 's shoulder , feel her chin or kiss her cheek , and endurance is the attitude most adopted by the female stars .
They are the very people of lower nine professions
Those stars are just pretending , they are all actually living a much damned better life than this
Agree , just cheap entertainers . Their reputation in feudal China somewhat makes sense .
Agree !
Ah well , it is not easy to be an actress
They deserve it . They asked for that .
It dawned on me nothing is easy !
The women are birds and beasts , and the men are worse than birds and beasts
In the summer of 2005 , a picture that people have long been looking forward to started emerging with frequency in various major Hong Kong media .
With their unique charm , these well - known cartoon images once again caused Hong Kong to be a focus of worldwide attention .
The world 's fifth Disney park will soon open to the public here .
The most important thing about Disney is that it is a global brand .
Well , for several years , although it was still under construction and , er , not yet open , it can be said that many people have viewed Hong Kong with new respect .
Then welcome to the official writing ceremony of Hong Kong Disneyland .
The construction of Hong Kong Disneyland began two years ago , in 2003 .
In January of that year , the Hong Kong government turned over to Disney Corporation 200 hectares of land at the foot of Lantau Island that was obtained following the largest land reclamation project in recent years .
One .
Since then , this area has become a prohibited zone in Hong Kong .
As its neighbor on Lantau Island , Hong Kong International Airport had to change its flight routes to make this area a no - fly zone .
Mickey Mouse 's new home , settling on Chinese land for the first time , has captured worldwide attention .
There 's only one month left before the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland on September 12 .
The subway to Disney has already been constructed .
At subway stations , passengers will frequently press the station for Disney on ticket machines , trying to purchase tickets to enjoy the park when it first opens .
Meanwhile , the Disney subway station is scheduled to open on the same day as the park .
For two years , Disney has constantly maintained its mystery .
No media have been allowed to enter for photos .
We took a taxi along the path of the highway that heads toward Disney , trying to experience this mysterious park from close by .
However , before any of the Disney symbols were in sight , the car was stopped by a security guard at the intersection of the road towards Disney .
On our way back , the taxi driver gave us an explanation after understanding our intentions .
Er , according to what the security guard said , for the time before everything is officially opened , opened , all , no cars can enter unless they have special permission .
No one can enter otherwise .
Video recording is especially forbidden .
Ah , everything is top secret .
If pictures are taken without permission , %pw that is to say , it will at all times be pursued by legal action , a big hassle .
Although Disney Corporation chose Hong Kong as the venue for the Chinese Disney park , what they are actually most excited about is the mainland China tourist market .
Since the implementation of the Individual Visit Scheme between Hong Kong and the mainland , more and more mainland tourists are coming to visit Hong Kong .
From the beginning up till now , more than seven million individual tourists have , have come to Hong Kong .
Well , we now , er , believe more will be coming .
At this point , it has been about two years .
Also , the current number of 34 cities will be increased .
Hong Kong was developed from a fishing harbor one hundred years ago to become today 's international metropolis .
Here , eastern and western cultures have gathered , and the new and the old coexist .
When in Hong Kong , you can wander among skyscrapers , heartily enjoy shopping sprees in well - known stores and malls for goods from various countries , and taste delicious snacks from all over the world at tea shops or at street stands in Mong Kok .
You can go to burn incense and make a vow at the Repulse Bay , where all deities gather .
You can enjoy the most charming sun - filled sandy beaches in Hong Kong .
You can ascend Victoria Peak to get a panoramic view of Victoria Harbor 's beautiful scenery .
Or hop onto a trolley with over a century of history , and feel the city 's blend of the old and the modern in slow motion .
After dark , cruise Victoria Harbor at night to enjoy the enchanting evening view .
Every corner of Hong Kong is filled with fun .
Meanwhile , as various new items are constantly being added , what other kinds of pleasant surprises will the Hong Kong tourism industry bring us ?
Over the past 28 years , the Ocean Park has basically been a must - see destination for tourists coming to Hong Kong .
Watch spectacular performances by dolphins and sea lions at the Ocean Theater , and experience passionate screaming and accelerating heart - beat adventures on amusement rides .
Or ride the giant Ferris wheel to get a bird 's eye view from high above of the magnificent panorama of Hong Kong Island and the South China Sea .
These items , which were the pride of the Ocean Park , have made this place the most popular tourist attraction in Hong Kong for some time .
However , since Disney entered Hong Kong , the Ocean Park , sharing the same city as Disney , has felt the pressure of competition .
To improve the park 's brand , they are planning to invest 5.5 billion in a renovation project starting in 2006 .
It seems that for the future , we have a scheme , a major renovation plan .
That is , the entire park will be divided into seven sections for renovation .
Ah , additional , newer , ah , attractions will be available for tourists .
It seems that those attractions like the North Pole and the Marine Life Center will also be renovated after several years .
Are they going to be different from what they are now ?
They will be , in ten years .
Ah , there will be more animals , and more animal species , different from what there is now .
It looks like we will also bring in whales .
Er , we will implement this plan as soon as it is approved by the government .
Groundbreaking is expected to start next year .
Yes .
The area of Hong Kong is only one thousand - plus square kilometers .
The population is dense .
Natural resources are relatively scarce .
However , the clever Hong Kong people will utilize all resources they have created for developing the Hong Kong tourism industry .
Among these is the Avenue of Stars .
Entering Hollywood of the East ,
here , you can come up close with the stars in your mind .
He is my .
She is my Goddess , ah .
Please stay with us on New World Travel .
Hong Kong has always worn the crown of Hollywood of the East .
Over the past 100 years of film history , Hong Kong cinema has nurtured many internationally renowned directors , actors , and screenwriters .
They have shortened the distance between Hong Kong and the world .
Hong Kong movies have even become a window for the world to see Hong Kong , which have made the image of metropolitan Hong Kong more prominent internationally .
For this reason , in 2004 , on the Waterfront Promenade originally constructed for viewing only the scenery of Hong Kong Island and Victoria Harbor , the Hong Kong Tourism Board also constructed the Avenue of Stars , memorializing Hong Kong 's 100 - year film history .
Here , tourists can learn about Hong Kong 's film history , and can come up close with the stars in their mind .
Hong Kong is a busy metropolis .
Even at dusk , the city 's pulse never stops beating .
Across from the Avenue of Stars , a special performance is staged every weekend .
%pw As our Victoria Harbor is %pw very famous , and , er , our nightscape is already very beautiful , by what means could we enhance the dynamic beauty of our nightscape ?
So , one idea was to transform Victoria Harbor into a performance stage .
Er , each key building is like a performer .
It is based on this that music and lights are arranged to reflect each other and perform a unique , er , and fascinating multi @-@ media world - class light show .
Let me now introduce to you all the well - known skyscrapers participating in this large - scale light and music show .
The PLA Hong Kong Garrison Plaza , Bank of China Tower , at 8 @:@ 00 every Saturday night , HSBC Main Building .
Their performances will be on schedule .
Center of the East Central .
Ten landmark buildings located on Hong Kong Island reveal themselves one by one , participating in the show in full splendor , presenting a world - class light extravaganza to a musical rhythm .
Whenever there is a major event or holiday , fireworks are also added to the light show .
Some , er , cities have consulted with us .
Uh @-@ huh .
Their area of surprise was that those private , er , buildings , that is , the business community , ah , is willing to invest in our overall project .
Yes .
The answer is that this is a reward to the entire society , not an individual building 's reward .
Er , of course , after SARS , we felt that all of Hong Kong hopes to be involved , so that the Hong Kong tourism industry will recover , rebound together with other sectors .
Hong Kong Wetland Park , which is currently under construction , is also one of the designated new projects of the Hong Kong SAR government for advancing the Hong Kong tourism industry .
This is a park intimately connected with nature , being built by the Hong Kong government for its people who live in a city of reinforced concrete .
Hong Kong Wetland Park covers an area of 61 hectares , including a 10,000 square meter visitor 's center and a 60 hectare outdoor wildlife habitat .
In the indoor exhibition hall , tourists can learn about types of wetlands in various parts of the world , and to gain knowledge about wetlands .
Outdoors , they can also personally experience wetland ecology .
At the highest point of Hong Kong , er , from the highest point we can see two different ecological environments .
Ha , on that side are many tall buildings , that is , towns with lots of people living there ,
but behind me is our Wetland Park .
Ha , entirely different .
Quite primitive ,
er , a fresh water swamp ,
er , the Wetland Park Exploration Center .
Lastly , farthest away you can see Putian of Shenzhen .
Then , the bridge is , on the bridge is Hong Kong and outside is Shenzhen .
You can come into intimate contact with nature in the outdoor wetland environment .
Children can get to know different animals and plants , and even some crops that are rarely seen in our daily life .
Over here are paddy fields , which is rather unique .
Ha , there are aquatic plants inside .
Ah , the most special is rice , because %pw many Hong Kong children nowadays have never seen what rice looks like .
Look over there .
They are going to be ripe soon .
The long one over there .
Oh .
Yes .
With , with ears , ah .
Where ?
Ah , here .
Perhaps there will be an introduction so that children will know the names of the crops when they see them .
Let , let them get some understanding .
Mai Po Marshes adjacent to Wetland Park is a major wildlife habitat within Asia .
Each year , over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong 's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here .
As a result , three different types of aviaries were built in Hong Kong Wetland Park .
These have become the best spots to observe birds .
Among common birds , a rather special one is the black - faced spoonbill .
It is an endangered bird species throughout the world .
Uh @-@ huh .
Ah , there are only about 1,500 in the world .
Wow .
Um , however , each year , about two to three hundred of them come to Hong Kong to spend the winter .
Some of them , er , have stayed in Hong Kong Wetland Park .
Uh @-@ huh .
So , our park 's logo is unique , featuring this black - faced spoonbill , which hopefully can draw people 's attention .
Uh @-@ huh .
Wetland Park workers are now in the middle of intensive work .
They will complete the park 's entire construction by the beginning of 2006 , to be able to participate in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year campaign .
Ah , we have established the year 2006 as Discover Hong Kong Year .
Why is that ?
Because , as everyone knows , our Disneyland will open in September of this year .
In addition , we will have Ngong Ping 360 , that is , the cable car , er , to the Giant Buddha .
They add to what we already have , like the Avenue of Stars , which is also very famous .
Moreover , er , we are including our software .
Hong Kong 's software is very well known .
Like what 's used in our Symphony of Lights .
We hope to use , er , a variety of hardware and software to package this entire 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year .
Without planning it in advance , they chose to settle here .
A dream that has been anticipated for more than twenty years will soon come true here .
Because your line connects us with two --
In recent years , Hong Kong 's tourist attractions have gradually moved from Hong Kong Island to Kowloon and the New Territory .
Two out of the four new attractions participating in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year are located on Lantau Island of the New Territory .
For this reason , Lantau Island has become a new Hong Kong tourism popular spot .
The earliest to settle here was this world 's largest outdoor seated bronze Buddha .
In Chinese Buddhism , there are five directions - east , west , south , north , and center - and five Buddhas .
Therefore , Hong Kong 's Tian Tan Giant Buddha at the most southern tip of China , together with Lingshan Giant Buddha in the east , Leshan Giant Buddha in the west , Yungang Giant Buddha in the north , and Longmen Giant Buddha in the Central Plains , exist as the representative Buddhas for each of the five directions of China .
As a result , this place has become holy land in the hearts of male and female devotees .
However , to common tourists , more of what this place brings them is wonder and awe .
Since this giant bronze Buddha settled on Lantau Island , the world renowned Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok and Disneyland have also been constructed here in succession .
The important status of Lantau Island is increasingly apparent .
No , it was totally inaccessible in the past .
In the near future , construction will also begin on a cross @-@ sea bridge connecting Hong Kong , Zhuhai , and Macao .
In 1992 --
Could n't go in summer --
So , after their return , Macao , and Hong Kong , the two special administrative regions , are basically still using ships and helicopters to stay connected .
It 's extremely troublesome to get there via land .
One has to go up to Shenzhen , Dongguan , then go through Panyu , keep going up , to Zhongshan , and certainly go to Zhuhai , then pass through Zhuhai to get to Macao .
For a Hong Kong person choosing to go there via land , it 's extremely inconvenient .
A full twenty years ago , Hopewell Holdings Group Chairman Wu Ying - sheung , a well - known construction tycoon , boldly made a cross @-@ sea bridge proposal .
With this bridge , the distance would be very small , only a little over one kilometer .
However , due to various reasons , bridge construction was put off .
This is what we have seen since 1999 .
Anticipated for 20 years , today this dream is finally coming true .
Well , originally the construction of the new --
With this new Hong Kong - Zhuhai - Macao bridge that basically leads to all three places , Hong Kong , Macao , and Zhuhai , basically , at the start of the bridge , you can get on the separate road to the place you want to go .
Macao is this way , and Zhuhai is this way .
From the perspective of either Hong Kong , Macao , or Zhuhai , our concept is a tourism zone .
Er , %pw Zhuhai for sightseeing tours , Macao for entertainment , and we have Disneyland and other , other attractions in Hong Kong .
Each place has different attractions of its own .
So , with this bridge , when some old friends , friends from mainland China or from foreign countries come to our place , it seems they can basically enjoy a complete tour with great convenience in several days , before , ha , going home .
Once the Zhuhai - Hong Kong - Macao bridge is built , it will no longer be a dream of tourists to enjoy gourmet food in Macao before having fun at Disneyland just an hour later .
Promotion of Hong Kong Disneyland has long since begun .
However , even though it has entered the last countdown period before its final opening , this wonderland is still unwilling to take off its mysterious veil .
Ah , currently it has been decided that Disney will open on September 12 .
There 's also what we call soft opening .
Ah , they are now rehearsing .
Ah , different , ah , some groups , they are rehearsing their service , well , hoping that they will become used to the service , be familiar with it , when our tourists come in September .
Well , I am very confident , that when our tourists come to Disneyland , they will certainly return home very satisfied .
The Wonder Tour will start from Hong Kong .
This dynamic metropolis never ceases its movement .
It continues to explore ; it continues to open new worlds .
Each day , there is always something new for people to experience and to love about this city .
Hong Kong is a world famous shopping paradise .
What determined the position of Hong Kong as a shopping paradise ?
Is it because of abundant merchandise or high quality at low prices ?
Is it a paradise for the rich or the general public ?
After all , what are the joyful memories from inside paradise ?
We respectfully invite you to watch Hong Kong : a Shopping Paradise in this edition of Across China .
Hello , everyone .
This is the Cross Strait program on CCTV International Channel .
Welcome to our program .
First let 's focus on the main contents of today 's program .
Wang Jin - pyng says that he has decided not to continue serving as KMT vice chairman .
Candidates for the giant pandas to be presented to Taiwan as gifts from the mainland may increase .
Taiwan 's military uses Taipei Aerospace Exhibition as an opportunity for pressing arms procurement .
Recently , the 2005 Ningxia Investment and Trade Fair and Ningxia - Taiwan Economic and Trade Cooperation Seminar were held in the city of Yinchuan .
More than three hundred Taiwanese businesspeople gathered in this land known as " lush southern - type fields north of the Great Wall , " beginning their tour and inspection journey .
Well , what is the unique charm in Ningxia of the western region that has attracted the attention of so many Taiwanese businesspeople ?
Please watch this edition of Hot Topic Analysis for a detailed report .
The KMT vice chairman arrived at party headquarters to meet with KMT Chairman Lien Chan on the afternoon of %pw .
After a long talk of over an hour , Wang Jin - pyng expressed his wish not to renew his term as KMT vice chairman .
He said that he will follow Lien Chan as a lifelong volunteer .
%pw
He can n't seem to help himself from apologizing for anything and everything .
Hallmark could make a fortune off of this guy .
I do n't follow , why should he apologize to Palin ?
Did Palin apologize to Giffords ?
He needs to conduct a beer summit between Palin and NBC .
Mend some fences and get this country moving .
He could call it the APOLOGIES ON BEER tour .
Hell , sell tickets and hire the Chinese to cater the event .
Who Drops Out After Super Tuesday ?
I think Romney wins big today and obviously stays in .
Santorum gets enough of a boost to do the Huckabee hangs around .
I think Gingrich 's sole win in GA is enough to hang it up and go back to making millions in the private sector .
I think the Good Doctor is too crazy to hang it up .
I will stick around until the end .
No one
I think Mitt drops out @...
Ok , my answer is no one and Obama wins the GE .
The only one with any reason to will be Newt , but I do n't think that he will .
Ron Paul says tornado victims should not get aid
Nuts .
My heart goes out to the people in tornado alley and I have no problem with my tax dollars going to help the survivors rebuild their lives .
If you have no problem with your tax dollars going to aid them then you 'd have no problem donating to them of your own free will .
Not to mention that he 's absolutely right that they should have insurance to cover them .
Ron Paul is not quite bright .
He 's right in some ways but it does n't translate into being right across the board .
This is n't like someone 's house burning down and they make an insurance claim .
Everything is gone , the entire infrastructure is gone .
Even if someone has insurance to cover their loss , that will n't extend to the roads , power lines , sewers , public buildings .
The problem with this regime is aid is not distributed equally .
Democrats get it , minorities get it , white republican jurisdictions do n't .
Aid is now patronage , good party members get it .
Is n't it interesting how Libertarians @' desire for "@ freedom @" correspond so neatly with skinflints who do n't want to give ANYONE , ANYTHING .
So while libertarianism attracts people who want to be "@ free @" it also attracts cheap assholes who do n't want to pay their fair share .
Perhaps when Libertarians figure out a way to differentiate between the two , I 'll vote for them .
I get what Ron Paul is saying .
Thats what a Hardcore Libertarian would say .
But the rest of us are thinking about the people that do not have insurance and / or need help right now .
Kind of hard to build a house over night , Mr Paul .
Kind of hard to import food considering that the stores are probably wiped out too .
How does one survive until the insurance ( hopefully by a respectable company ) claim comes through ?
How does one survive when you have the funds but the people you need to buy the goods from has no address ?
I know , you get into your pickup and drive over to the next town -- if you can find your damn pickup !!
Homeowners generally have insurance , but Federal Aid is necessary to provide for the clean up , repairs of electrical and water systems , roads , schools , buses , etc. etc.
Keep in mind insurance companies are not in the business of paying claims , they are in the business of making money .
Anyone who suffers a loss as have those who lost everything over the weekend will not be made whole , and whatever claim they receive will not come soon or easy .
Ron Paul and his Libertarian ideas are at best impractical .
No surprise there .
He had to win there to stay in , so ultimately this helps Mitt keep the vote split .
Best outcome of the night would have been Newt losing there .
He 's a nonfactor at this point and only in out of spite .
If he were out of the race , Santorum might have had a chance .
The Catholic Church is opposed to contraception for moral reasons .
Where is the morality in creating a life when food and clean water are rare commodities ?
Where poverty exists and educational opportunities are non existent ?
Where is the morality when disease is spread ?
Where is the morality when a women is the victim of domestic violence ?
When a women is forced to conceive and then trapped as the child become a lever to gain more power and more control ?
I am with you .
If you can n't feed , house and take care of a baby you have no business having one .
Why is it literally 100 % impossible for the liberal mind to understand that just because you do n't want government involved in something does n't mean you 're against it ?
I 'm in favor of feeding , clothing , and giving shelter to the poor . I 'm against all the gov't institutions that tax our brains out and who inefficiently attempt to provide some of these things .
Now am I just a genius who does n't know it , or is it really not THAT hard to understand such a simple concept ?
Will they try to prop Romney up with a strong VP to help make him more palatable - or will they bring in a new face ?
Either way , they 've got a big problem .
Are n't you one of the assholes who assured us how Romney was inevitable as the GOP nominee ?
I do n't think Standtorum will tank , its going to be a close one till the very end , I am still rooting for a Romney / McDonnell ticket .
Wow , another Solyndra @-@ type company who took our money and failed in their goal .
They laid off 125 employees , but gave big raises to executives .
Another scam that the media will ignore .
After seeing those bus tours to AIG execs homes , promoted on ACORN 's website , I am wondering why those same people are n't outraged at this .
Maybe because it would look bad for the guy who promises to pay their mortgages , put gas in their tanks , gave them free cell phones and increased the welfare rolls .
Of course , the people on the AIG bus tours likely did n't get soaked with high taxes to pay for this scam , so why should they care ?
This is not surprising or shocking to me .
Obama must pay off his supporters by way of cash infusions and call it "@ stimulus @" money .
He is not lying to call it stimulus .
It stimulates others to be big contributors so they may be in on the next wave of free cash from the boy king .
Another victory for the left because there are more people in need .
The government will rush in and show these people that government dependency is better than working and providing for themselves .
That is the plan with all the liberal policies .
No one should be expected to practice self sufficiency or concern themselves with personal responsibility .
Increase the welfare rolls till the takers outweigh the givers . Only then can socialism creep in .
Everything Obama has done is straight from Alinsky 's Rules for Radicals . All of it .
If some on the left want to remain ignorant and not read Alinky 's book to prove it , that is on them .
For those in the know , this was all quite predicable .
Dumb , dumb dumb @...
I 've always been a critic of judges who decide they are going to disregard the will of legistlatures and the populace and impose these things , but here 's a case where they did it the right way ,
they passed a bill , and Christie the Hutt decides he 's stull sucking up to be RomBot 's running mate .
Christie is being set up on this one and the legislature called his bluff
It will make him a big shot with the GOP in 2012 but by 2016 if he were to run for president "@ Christie vetoed gay marriage @" will be a millstone around his neck .
By 2016 most Americans will have gay marriage available .
Christies denial of marriage privleges to gays will alienate independents and his "@ I wanted to have the people vote on it @" will ring hollow
It is Santorum that is the by far major nonRomney candidate and Newt would appear to be the spoiler .
When the situation was reversed Gingrich argued that Santorum was helping Romney get the nomination and for the good of the conservative cause Santorum should drop out .
Now that the same logic would apply to Gingrich dropping out , should he ?
Sure , why not .
I think Santorum is going to be the last of the "@ Not Romneys @" , and Newt has had his moment .
Who know . He may make a comeback .
Of course money is a problem for him so he may HAVE to drop out .
Santorum or Mitt . I could vote for either one .
No , why should he ?
He is , if nothing else , insuring that he 'll be able to sell books after the election .
I mean you do n't really think that any of these guys really give a shit about their party or their nation , do ya ?
More than they care about themselves , I mean .
Americans @' assessment of Congress has hit a new low , with 13 % saying they approve of the way Congress is handling its job .
The 83 % disapproval rating is also the worst Gallup has measured in more than 30 years of tracking Congressional Job Performance .
Ever notice that the more gridlock there is , the more Congress @' ratings go down .
In other words , Congress should stop all the politcal bickering , put their heads together and start working things out in a real bi @-@ partisan format .
It worked for Reagan and Clinton and look at the positive results .
I 'm not the least bit surprised .
I 'm still waiting for Pelosi to drain the damned swamp .
Today on the Senate floor Durbin said healthcare premiums WILL NOT GO DOWN and that the Administration needs to quit saying that !!!!
Then Nancy Pelosi in the House said we need to pass the Healthcare Bill so "@ we can find out what 's in it @.....@ @"
The Democrats are slowy turning Congress into Bozo 's Bigtop Circus !!!!!
The insurance industry 's own institute said premiums would skyrocket .
How could they not ?
If you force them to accept pre @-@ existing conditions and accept other insured 's currently not eligible because they cost too much , who is going to pay for that extra risk ?
You can n't legislate risk away . Of course premiums will rise .
The administration is in campaign mode , willing to say or do anything to get this turd passed .
The joke will be on House Dems who are being promised a bill to "@ fix @" the problems with teh Senate bill .
Anyone who believes that will happen is dreaming .
Obama will hang them out to dry .
1 . Ending the war in Iraq
2 . Developing American energy independence
3 . Universal healthcare for all Americans
Works for me @......
Only if that means it is over because we won .
And we will have some very strategically located , large bases to counter Iranian and Russian aggression for the next 50 years .
A good thing , but he will have to include things he opposes , like DRILLING and NUCLEAR power , along with coal power to get there .
Only if he adopts Hillary 's plan of MANDATORY UNIVERSAL PARTICIPATION .
Which means EVERYONE , without exception , PAYS premiums .
Here are the things that should be Obama 's top priorities .
#1 Ending the war in Iraq
#2 Bringing us Universal Healthcare
#3 Repealing NAFTA
#4 Repealing The Patriot Act
#5 Repealing Taft @-@ Hartley
#6 Bringing Bush / Cheney up on criminal charges for war crimes . ( send them to the Haig !!! )
#7 Fire John Bolton !
#8 Strengthen the FISA act
#9 Abolish The Office Of Homeland Security !
#10 Prosecute John Ashcroft !
what about when my favorite doctor quits because he is not going to take a pay cut ?
or just lets the quality of his practice go down the tubes ?
also , who is going to goto school for 15 years to be a doctor , with major student loans and only make a sub @-@ par government salary ?
i 'll tell ya what , if were going to goto school for 15 years , it would be for rocket science or computer engineering or something of that nature so i could easily make an above average salary .
last and most importantly , i never want to see any of my paycheck support some lazy person who does not work because the government pays for them to live their life .
I plan on voting against every single one of these dirtbags that call themselves representatives .
Our congress , be it the house or senate , are a bunch of non @-@ representing representatives .
Its as if the British Red Coats were in charge once again doing whatever is best for themselves irregardless of the consitution .
I say kick them all out of office , and then do it again every election for the next several cycles until they get the hint .
WE ARE NOT HAPPY , WE ARE NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE !!!!
Am I the only one or are some of you feeling like this too ?
I 'm not a Republican , I 'm not a democrat , I AM AN AMERICAN !!!!!
Start respecting my country , my consitution , and our national heritage or get fired / voted out .
Add your 2 cents people .
I 'll have a Senator to vote for along with my Representative , and Senator Voinovich is not running in 2010 so I 'll luckily have more options to vote for .
So far there are 3 candidates in the race that I 'm aware of , and I 'm not impressed by any of them .
But hopefully somebody good pops up that I can support .
As far as my Representative goes , I can n't wait to vote against him .
I do n't vote '@ against @' anyone .
I vote '@ for @' the best candidate for the job , regardless of political affiliation ( unless , of course , they are un @-@ American , like Libtards and Neocons ) .
Since none of the incumbents in my district will get my vote , I guess you could say I 'm voting '@ against @' them , but I 'm still not comfortable with that term .
Where would McCain be without Sarah ?
A lot of us , including myself , have had fun poking , jabbing , making fun of Palin , her lack of knowledge about the Constitution , her appearance on SNL , etc. @...
but at this late date in the race @...
Where would he , ( McCain ) , be if he did not have her as his running mate
IMO @.... she is helping him more now , because he is hurting himself , more .
Palin solidified the Republican base for McCain .
She invigorated the far right wingers to actually go out and campaign for McCain , instead of apathetically voting for McCain to spite Obama .
Palin is the real star behind the Republican ticket this year .
If it were anyone else , McCain would not have a shot in hell .
Palin invigorated Obama 's campaign , and she is one of the reasons Obama raised $ 150 million dollars in September .
When I saw her speech at the convention , I immediately sent Obama as much money as I could .
Presidential Candidates @: Chuck Baldwin ( C ) Constitution Party Bob Barr ( L ) Libertarian McCain ( R ) Cynthia McKinney ( G ) Green Ralph Nader ( I ) Independent Obama ( D )
Looks like women have a candidate running for President .
Why are n't women flocking to her ?
What 's wrong with the Green party ?
The woman is a nutjob .
She would make Ralph Nader look like Barack Obama .
Why on earth would women vote for the Green Party just because they have a female candidate ?
Sorry , I would n't have voted for Hillary , either .
I would vote for Sarah or Condy .
THe Green Party is the party for the libtards who are too crazy even for other libtards .
If the Government provides Health Care , whether spelled out in this bill or not , it will RATION the care .
That is how it works .
The Government can not afford to pay for everything for everyone , even if they took all our money .
And in fact the research that backs up this health care bill out of the House spells it out clearly .
Specifically it identifies the elderly and those under the age of 2 as being less important and so they will be the first to suffer from reduced services .
Knowing that the Government can not efficiently run anything , I can promise it will n't end there .
Since all healthcare is rationed , the question for me is do I want those decisions to rest with corporations whose sole reason for existence is to make a profit --- profits which depend upon insuring the healthiest among us , and denying coverage for those whom they may have to pay claims ?
Corporations where profits are dependent on NOT providing the services I pay for ?
That can at any point in time decide to cancel my policy , leaving me without any coverage at all and no prospects of obtaining coverage on my own ?
That spend 1 / 3 of their revenue in administrative overhead ?
I have not seen much cold weather , or snow , here in the northeast .
Meterologist say this will be a warmer than usual winter this year .
Many temperatures have been above what is normal for this time of year .
Is this Winter weather going to be what winters will be like in the future . ?
Warmer temperatures . ?
Is what global warming is about . ?
Hey stupid , Maine 's getting 4 @-@ 8 inches of snow tonight .
When it snowed in October it was Global Warming too
52 nd Street all up in the white .
I see mr. Biker boys . Thanks for letting me know .
Whats the name of that motor cycle gang you belong to ??
Its warmer , therefore Global Warming
It 's snowing , therefore Global Warming
When will it be too late to do anything about global warming ?
Have we already guaranteed our doom ?
So you are a warmist too ehh ?
Sorry to hear .
The facts @.... from about 1980 to 1998 we had a 1 / 3 of a degree warming period .
This started the Man made global warming claim .
Another inconvenient fact for the man made global warming crowd . Since 1998 until today there has been no significant warming .
A further fact . In the early 1900 's scientists predicted that over the next 100 years the temperature would go up globally about 1 degree . And that is what it did .
So we had an 18 year trend that saw a rise of 1 / 3 of a degree world wide . Followed to date by a 14 year period with no appreciable warming . Remind me again how we are all doomed ?
Experiencing the great platonic year .
Precission of the earths equinox refers to the earth 's axis wobble moving in an unconventional way .
Time period event is a 25765 yrs wobble path .
Notice the ice cap weight shifting it is due to earths own inertia and the sun moon alignment .
This vid indicates inertia shifts in ice not to be due to global warming but due to physics of the earth , sun , moon system .
This inertia of the sun earth moon generates potential physical plate movements on earth , ie earthquakes .
Very cool stuff .
So is this because of global warming or is it Bush 's fault ?
It 's a good thing the polar ice cap is shrinking then right ?
This seems to explain the record snow fall in Siberia and Alaska .
Nobody as yet really understands why periodically earth undergoes geomagnetic reversal . But the wandering magnetic pole seems to have been happening for the last 200 million years .
Happens regularly , and seems to have little effect on the biosphere as a whole .
No unusual events in the paleo record seem to be associated with magnetic reversals .
but everyone knows that what man makes does n't count huh ?
Not , I suspect , as it relates to magnetic pole shift or drift .
You just know that some ignorant fool is going to blame pollution .
This is really eye opening .
Where are the environmentalists ?
Have you seen the trash along the roads and in the ditches across this county ?
I see chairs couches refrigerators and who knows what else out here in the countryside .
People have no respect for their neighbors and I am talking about Americans here .
If they have no respect for their neighbors or fellow countrymen how can they have respect for themselves ?
Its not everybody but a small segment of our society but the question is how small is this segment ?
Now that is precisely what I am referring to .
Instead of focusing on the filthy habits of illegals violating our border , you go one a mission to deflect .
Not today , pal .
Stay on point !
Whole apartment was shaking .
Far out and funky !
What the hell ?
Two Thumbs said he felt this too in PA .
Nothing here in Birmingham though .
did you think earthquake at first ?
Felt it here just outside of Reading , PA !
Thought I was having a seizure or something at first , till I saw the water in my water bottle swaying back and forth .
The book shelf in my computer room was moving back and forth .
Weird dude .
Was going on for like 20 seconds .
The time of water wars is upon us with the privatization of water resources worldwide by multinational conglomerates who are not accountable to , or suppressible by the local populations they effect , even here in America .
What say you ?
'@ Flow , @' a documentary on what the privatization of water really means which was the inspiration for me creating this thread .
It brings to light the insane and completely immoral behavior of water corporations ( Nestle , Coke , Pepsi , as well as Suez and Vivendi , and their involvement with the World Bank ) @...
I am never going to buy another Coke , Pepsi , or Nestle product until @...
I am dying of thirst , which is the situation many in the world find themselves in now .
Allowing the privatization of public waters sources is stupid beyond all understanding .
Water is resource of the commonweal and ought never to be allowed to become captured by any private concern .
Right now corporations like Nestles are buying up the world 's best springs to make bottled water .
Allowing this to happen is a perfect example of how perverted our governments have become .
Hey @........@ 30 years ago , I was reading about all kinds of hysterical doomsday theories of the extinction of this natural resource or that natural resource .
You get a few decades down the line and realize there are lots of smart people out there who roll out hysterical theories because they know there are millions of suckers out there who 'll buy it in a heartbeat and profit handsomely FTW !!!
My wife works with the GAO a lot and she sent this report over to me .
They report on just how difficult it will be to regulate the amount of CO2 being released .
http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10818.pdf
Of course it will be difficult .
The energy companies are putting many , many tens of millions of dollars into preventing anything at all from being done .
But we will probably start doing it well after it will make no differance .
Our grandchildren will curse the blindness and greed of this generation .
I went to youtube and checked out the Gulf oil crisis @: all of the posts are one month old , or older @...
How many million people post on youtube ?
The first two months there were hundreds of private citizens with their video cams reporting about what was happening in the gulf @... showing everyone firsthand eyewitness accounts of the incompetence of BP and the lack of government response .
Now there are none @: zero @: nobody has posted one single video on youtube about the gulf oil crisi for one month .
This stinks to high heaven .
Do n't tell me nobody has posted anything on the gulf crisis for one month @: there is a media bl ; ackouit going on .
The last time something like this happened that I know of ; was the republican convention in New York for the renomination of Bush Jr for a second term in office .
Would n't that be a YOUTUBE blackout , then ?
I mean , rather than a MEDIA blackout ?
gulf oil spill - Google Search = Plenty of coverage about the oil spill still on the media .
That 's the point @: the oil has not been cleaned up @: its sunk below the surface @: just like all the true facts have sunk out of sight .
The dispersant they used , Corexit ; has destroyed all possibility of cleaning up the oil because it 's made the oil sunk below the surface .
BP 's use of corexit is a quick way of sweeping the problem under the carpet @: idiots who do n't see the oil on the surface will assume that there is n't any ecological damage going on .
Instead , the ecological damage to the entire area is now a million times worse than it was when the oil was still on the surface .
The oil beneath the surface @: millions and millions of gallons of oil is killing all wildlife , all the fish , all the dolphins , all the crabs , all the shrimp , everything .
To people who do n't live there @: the horror of this catastrophe made worse by BP can not be understated enough .
Yes you read that correctly @....@ lets just assign a number because we want too !
Yeah that 's the ticket !
These clowns commit this fraudulent behavior all the fricking time and old fraud , chris , konradv , trolling blunder and a whole host of others ignore this .
What is so distorted in their fundamental makeup that they can see this desecration of science and ignore it ?
In fact they support and revere it .
Bizarre .
Yes , they have been extrapolating temps for areas where they had no direct measurement . However , as they stated , one should use the NCDC measurements for those areas , if very accurate measurements are desired .
Yet , for all of Watts yapping , none of this changes the fact that the warming continues , and differant agencies have better accuracy in some places than others , depending on the methods used .
Another item concerning Watts .
He is not a meteorologist .
He is a fraud in that department .
Tomorrow , the Employment Situation Report comes out and as usual , there will be idiots claiming the government does n't count people not receiving unemployment benefits , or that the government is n't counting people who should be counted etc.
So let 's discuss .
Question @: What exactly do we want to measure and why ?
Answer @: We want to measure the Labor Market and how it is changing , especially how difficult it is to get a job .
First difficulty is that not everyone can freely participate in the labor market .
There are laws and barriers afffecting groups of people .
While children can work , there are significant restrictions as to field , hours , changing jobs etc.
At approx age 16 the restrictions are gone , almost all jobs are open for full or part time work .
So we ignore anyone under 16 .
Next group are prisoners . While some "@ work @" it 's not really a labor market system and working or not working are not free choices of entry and exit .
So we ignore prisoners .
Next group are those mentally or physically incapable of working .
While many disabled and those with psychological conditions do work , those who are institutionalized or in long term care ( such as a hospice ) can n't .
So we ignore those in an institution or long term care .
There remains many disabled who can n't work but are n't in an institution , but since some can and some can n't work , there 's no bright line , so we include them all .
Next @: Retirees .
Many countries exclude those over the age of 65 .
For a country with mandatory retirement , or generous government pensions , that is sensible as almost all those over 65 do n't need to work and do n't work and including them can distort the picture .
But in the US , there is no mandatory retirement ( except in military / police ) and retirement benefits are not as generous or universal .
So no maximum age limit for us .
Last , military . For a while , they were counted as employed ( 1984 @-@ 1994 ) but since there 's no free exit and it 's not a market system , including them just raises the number of employed by a fairly constant level , so it 's better to exclude the military .
So we have our population @: The Adult Civilian Non @-@ Institutional Population .
How do we divide that up ?
The key is to be as objective as possible .
Since we have to use a survey ( it 's just not possible to do a full count every month ) , any subjectivity will increase our error , so we have to avoid any possible overlaps or judgement calls .
Let 's look at Employed .
Who is employed ?
Some have suggested a minimum number of hours worked , but is that a good idea ?
Plenty of people voluntarily work few hours , or in a particular week only work a few hours . Should we say they do n't really have a job or are n't really working ?
That 's very subjecive . We do n't want to run into cases were someone nomrmally works 40 hours a week , but in the particular week of the survey she only worked 2 hours and counted as unemployed .
So we set a bright line of 1 hour for pay , and also include those as employed people temporarily absent due to brief illness , injury , vacation , strike , bad weather etc.
We can always look at sub groups later .
Unpaid labor .
Some people do n't get paid ( directly ) for work , either charity work or working on a family farm or family business .
Let 's not include charity work , because that 's not really part of the labor market .
But family business / farm is a different story @...@ the person is either just helping out , ( meaning if they do n't already have another job they would n't take one if they were n't working for family and / or no one would have to be hired in their place ) or they are a substantial part of the business preventing them from another job and filling a job slot no one else can take .
So let 's set a bright line of 15 hours a week and anyone working without pay on family business farm 15 hours or more a week is employed .
What about someone hired but not yet working ?
Many things can happen , so we will n't call them employed until they 're actually working .
Now for the Unemployed .
In casual usage , this can mean many different things , but what we want is a precise , objective definition .
And what we 're looking for is available workers who are n't working .
This has an impact on the labor market @..@ supply over demand .
Some people do n't want to work @...@ retirees , housewives / husbands , full time students , and some people on drugs or alcohol or criminals or lazy .
So let 's not count anyone who does n't want a job .
Should we count everyone who says they want a job ?
They could be lying .
They could be unable to take a job if offered ( meaning they 're not available labor ) .
So what bright line can we set ?
If someone is actually looking for work , sending a resume , going to an interview , on the union list , then we can safely assume that they are really available for work .
But if someone is n't DOING anything about a getting a job , then they 're not available , anymore than someone who does n't want to work .
Sure they may still consider themselves "@ unemployed @" and they may sincerely want to work , but since they 're not available , since they 're not part of the actual supply of labor and can n't be hired , we exclude them .
So we have our Employed , we have our Unemployed @....@ this is our Labor Force , our available supply of people who can work or be hired .
Everyone else is Not in the Labor Force .
Since the population tends to grow , for an historical comparison , it 's better to look at rates / ratios / percentages to get a clearer picture .
Labor Force Participation Rate @: The Labor Force as a percent of the Population .
This can be largely affected by non @-@ economic factors as the increase of women into the labor force in the 60 s and 70 s showed , but it gives a good look at how much of the population is trying to work .
Employment @-@ Population Ratio @: this tells us the percent of the population that 's actually working .
Again , non @-@ economic factors play a role but looking at the changes can tell us useful things .
Unemployment rate @: Unemployed as a percent of the Labor Force .
This tells us how much of available labor @...@ people willing and able and available to work @... is not being used .
This is all economic factors @...@ the percent of people trying and failing to get a job .
Does this give a complete picture of the Labor Market ?
Of course not @...@ it 's not meant to .
It does n't tell us types of job , if people are working as much as they want to , people who do n't believe they would be successful .
But it tells us what we 're looking for @: the percent of people who we know for sure can not get a job .
I think that explains the basics .
I 'll be happy to clarify questions or discuss any real issues .
The issue is simple , when 150 k jobs are created and you need 250 to maintain @...
Yet the UE rate goes down . 2 % then you have a choice @...
You can make believe things are getting better or you can understand that things are getting worse and deal with it .
You chose to make believe .
Neither side expects the other to be consistant .
I remember the libs making this argument during the Reagan years .
Of course , the real cuteness was during the Carter years during the run up to the 1980 election when the military was added to the employed part of the picture .
Presto , 2 million more employed persons and the unemployment rate when down by a substantial fraction .
that got quietly reversed after the election .
What is important here is that unemployment is no longer the short term thing it has usually been .
We have people looking for work who have been looking for three years or more .
We have folks just plain resigning from the work force and do n't look any more .
People who four years ago had successful careers .
Even under the regime of 99 week unemployment rather than 26 week , we have large numbers who have gone beyond benefits .
To maintain what ?
And does "@ it @" need to be maintained ?
Or you can do actual analysis of the data .
"@ Jobs @" comes from the Current Employment Statistics Survey ( CES ) while Unemployment ( and total employment ) comes from the Current Population Survey ( CPS ) .
The CES is non @-@ farm payroll employment . It excludes agriculture , the self @-@ employed , unpaid family workers and private employees ( private cooks , nannies , maids , etc. ) .
So "@ jobs @" may go up 150 K , but total employment goes up 300 K .
You can n't directly compare 2 measures that measure different things .
Much of the drop in UE has been for the wrong reasons @...@ a decreasing labor force .
That was not the case for the January drop .
At best things have been spotty lately @...@ up and down .
You can n't just look at one number or one measure and say "@ things are good @" or "@ things are bad . @"
The BEST unit of measure is , I think to determine how many Americans are WORKING .
Instead we get reports on the number of people who SELF REPORTED they are n't working but are looking for work .
To find out all we have to do is ask Bernie Sanders and remember that Obama voted to the left of Sanders while in the Senate .
God help us all if Obama ever got to appoint a liberal inflationist Fed Chairman .
Oh , and we might remember that when their God , Keynes , was asked about the future consequencs of his ultra easy monetary policies he said , do n't worry about the future , we 'll all be dead .
Bernie Sanders @: Another very important issue is with unemployment so high , how can we strengthen the Fed 's full @-@ employment mandate [ with inflation ] and ensure that it conducts monetary policy to achieve maximum employment ? [ through inflation ] .
In other words the Fed has a number of mandates and one of them is to control inflation .
But one of them also is to pursue policies that lead to full employment .
Is the Fed doing that in an adequate way ?
Well I would argue that by definition when you have 16 % of people unemployed and underemployed it really is not .
They 'd do exactly what they 've done since 1913 .
Lend out "@ money @" that does n't exist , charge interest for it , inflate the hell out of the currency and line their pockets in the process .
Then , they 'd bankroll endless stupid foreign wars , the socialistic welfare state , massive Ponzi schemes , endless bailouts of states , cities , corporations and foreign nations @....
The same thing a conservative Fed would do , and then they 'd call it brilliant and give obama the credit .
An NGDP target can fix the unemployment problem without resulting in inflation .
That 's a gross misunderstanding of the Keynes quote .
What he 's saying is n't , obviously , that we should n't care about the long run .
What he 's saying is that economists are taking the easy way out only ever considering the long run .
We need not only theories of the long run , but also theories of the short run .
Nobody can "@ fix the unemployment problem @" ....
This is the fatal conceit of socialistic central planners coming out of the chute .
"@ Global warming is real - it is man @-@ made and it is an important problem . But it is not the end of the world . @" - who said it ?
Bjørn Lomborg - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia
i think this issue is only valuable for the purposes of supporting commoditization of CO2 . that 's my explanation for why all of the funded scientists point to the gas and build the anthro argument . i do n't see how it is credible in light of more dominant causes .
I 'm curious Dante @...@ Dosen't the temp change by about 40 degrees , every year , in the northern and southern hemisphere ? Also , with warmer temps and more co2 in the atmosphere , would n't the number and variety of plants and trees increase ? What ever happened to the rain forest , nuclear meltdown , ozone layer , global cooling , or any of the other iminent catastrophes that will befall us if we do n't do something RIGHT NOW !! ? The only environmental issue important to envronmentalists is whatever one can generate the most money . At least oil companies get their cash by providing us with something we need . You enviro @-@ whackos get yours by doing absolutely nothing at all , except making life harder for everyone else .
In reality humans contribute about 5 % to global worming in terms of CO2 release into the atmosphere . Yes it is true that we are responsible for this number and trying to minimize it in whatever way we can , but humans are not ultimately the source of global worming . It is arrogant of us to think that we can effect the ecosystem of the world in such a drastic way in only 20 years . Science is divided on the issues with scientists in government labs reporting that global warming is an imminent threat caused by humans and only we can save the planet while scientists at universities and private organizations generally suggest that man is not the ultimate cause and in reality contributes little . The IPCC has published documentation and recommendations about global warming at regular intervals and it was not until one of their more recent publications that they completely overturned their previous data showing global warming to be natural in favor of new data that showed global warming to be human caused . The problem is that they used the same relative data set and simply changed the way it is viewed to maximize the human contribution . They have also been known to falsify information to suit their purposes and destroy information that proves them incorrect .
So it would appear that politics drives natural history and our relation to the ecosystem @...@ inherent problems there .
Consider too Rapid Climate Change Events as documented by paleoclimatological data from ice cores drilled out of Antarctica and atmospheric analysis of gas frozen in the ice . This heating process occurs every 22,000 years like clockwork for the past 150,000 years that our records go back . Guess what @...@ it has been just about 22,000 years @...@ fancy that .
Remember in the 80 s when the next ice age was around the corner and we were all going to freeze to death ?
Very simple . Adapting to a rapidly changing climate is preferable to changing our present habits , no matter how destructive they are to the coming generations , or to the rest of the biosphere .
For most people , the present rapid changes are already stretching their abilities to adapt . They see jobs that they considered safe niches now gone forever , with no demand for skills that took years to develop , and now the scientists are telling them that they have to change even more . That we should cease to use fossil fuels asap , that we need to switch to an energy base that features nuclear , wind , solar , geothermal , and other non @-@ polluting sources , that they do not understand , and have no experiance with .
I see otherwise intelligent people convincing themselves of the scientific equivelant of the sun rising in the West simply because they wish to avoid any more changes in the lives , and the way that they live . Which , of course , pushes the changes onto their children , and grandchildren , who will be facing a much more serious situation concerning the effects of a changing climate , a rapidly changing climate , than we face today .
Well , that is the culture of this nation , and our children will suffer the consequences of our inability to face reality .
How long would we live if we could replace body parts with exact matches ?
How about replacing our whole bodies and exchanging brains with that of a clone ?
Someday the micro surgery techiques will be available .
Would you participate ?
I would if it was sure fire .
They are patenting human genes right now .
Perhaps one has an inalienable right to patent ones own body and its specific type .
Do we own our own uniqueness ?
Your thoughts ?
interesting book @...@ last child in the woods @...@ talk about how this generation has accepted the merging of man / machine / animals @....@ that there are about 2000 patented life forms @...
i am not real sure what that means but i am sure xox can explain it @...
i find the idea of "@ cloning @" sillie @...

now that would be a brave new world .
Would I be able to order clones of Elisha Cuthbert and Jessica Alba that I could keep as sex slaves ?
If so , count me in .
Go ahead and slap a property tax on them too , I 'm good for it .
31 US troops were killed when the Chinook carrying them crashed .
May they rest in peace and condolences to the families and loved ones of these brave young men .
365 Coalition Troops killed this year ? Man , that 's a lot .
I did n't realize the casualties were that high this year .
Our MSM does n't seem very interested in covering the Afghan War much . I 'm really not sure why .
That 's bad but this is the unnecessary war Bush started .
This is war and people die in wars .
Over One Million Iraqi Deaths Caused by US Occupation
This happened in 2010 .
They are the first and only ones , I believe .
They did the same training , made it through .
That is pretty cool .
It 's like the "@ softest @" branch of the military and the toughest assignment together .
So these guys can be sitting in a bar next to some Marines .
Marines say , "@ so what are you ? @"
And they say , "@ we 're in the Coast Guard . @"
And maybe they snicker a little , but they should n't !
What makes people assume the Coast Guard is the softest branch ?
Ignorance ?
Maybe you never served in any Military branch and have no frame of reference ?
Not to diminish the great Navy Fleet Sailors who keep the gigantic ships running with all kinds of technical skills , Coast Guard people are the real Sailors who navigate tiny boats in high seas to rescue people , arrest criminals and keep America 's shores safe .
It 's not surprising that they could complete SEAL training if they wanted to .
I 've been reading through several news sites tonight and I just picked up on a great story about a US Air Force pilot who probably saved a lot of US Military lives in the early goings of the Iraq War .
Now let 's get one thing straight , I initially agreed with the reason for going into Iraq , but I no longer agree with it .
I support Obama 's decision to pull our troops out by next year .
I always , 100 % side with our brave men and women who are putting themselves in harm 's way .
Now today , I came upon this story on TV .
Lieutenant Colonel Victor Fehrenbach .
He was promoted to Lt. Colenel in 2006 .
He 's part of the 325 th Fighter Wing Mission that serves off of Tyndall Air Force Base flying F-15C 's and F-22 Raptors .
He 's been in the Air Force for 18 years .
He is just 2 years short of retirement .
He 's flown missions in Iraq , Afghanistan , Kosovo and has been awaiting re @-@ deployment a new tour of duty .
If you know anything about air force , he 's Afelm JT Fly Trng .
Back in 2003 this hero won the Air Medal for Heroism .
Back in April , 2003 the Army was making the initial advance to capture Baghdad Int'l airport , Victor and his wingmen found an Iraqi ambush site of about 12 APCs that were less than a mile from the Army advance .
At the time , his wingman was suffering from a major malfunction in his plane that prohibited him from deploying his weapons .
Within a timespan of 20 @-@ 30 minutes , he and his wingman were finally able to deploy all of their weapons and destroy the 8 APCs that were about to ambush the US Army on their mission to take Baghdad International Airport .
They took out the entire enemy position and that night the Army captured Baghdad International Airport .
Why am I posting this when there have been several hundred if not thousand of other US Soldiers , Seamen and Pilots who have each served their country heroicly and have also won medals , which some have even died for ?
Because this hero was 2 years away from retirement and is being discharged , against his will , from the Air Force . Is this because of bad behavior ? No . He has an excellent record of service and has never had any problems . Then why , if this 18 @-@ year veteran who is an excellent Pilot of the US Air Force being discharged against his will , 2 years before he retires ?
Because he 's openly gay . He 's commanded squadrons , saved other American soldiers @' lives and served with honor .
But because he is different than we are , because he is sexually attracted to men , his sexuality trumps the incredible record of service he 's had over 18 years .
Are you telling me that the most professionally trained , the meanest , the fiercest military in the world that can destroy any other enemy and accomplish any goal its given , can not accept men or women who have different seuxality tastes than other people ?
This Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell law absolutely MUST be repealed immediately !
Men and women who fight to save our country , who are more than willing to die to protect our freedom , must NOT be discriminated against .
It 's time to end prejudice and time to accept human beings for who they are - ESPEICALLY our heroic men and women in the US Military . Support Our Troops !
ALL OF THEM !
In these troubled times we simply can not do without this significant portion of potential enlistees , and talented senior members , to uphold an absurd , and bigoted , policy .
Most absurdly , we are allowing ourselves to fire Arabic language specialists , people whose positions are critical at this time , due to a trait that has no effect on the performance of their duties .
I know congress has a lot on their plates right now , but they need to move on this soon .
Preferably with a solution that would allow soldiers lost to this idiotic policy to reenlist if they still wish to .
Its not that the military is against gays .
The military is against things that make it run less efficiently .
Allowing blacks to enter the military increased its numbers and productivity thus the long term goals outweighed the short term unease .
Allowing openly gay men / women into the service would create Long term discomfort and you would see a decrease in troop numbers as well as military efficiency .
Because of the nature of the military and close quarters shared especially among men in war simulation , training and actual warfare the distraction of having someone who you know may be attracted to you can ultimately cause death because you are distracted .
As part of the Army ?
They do pretty much the same things though the Army has the much more elite units and more highly trained infantry .
The Army , as demonstrated by its successful execution of D-Day during WWII , is also capable of making daring amphibious assaults , so why not just disolve the Marines into the Army ?
You are aware that the Marine Corps is the only service that is protected by Congressional Act ?
The Marine Corps must maintain a minimum of 3 Divisions and can not be disbanded without a Congressional act .
This was done in the early 1950 's because of rejects like you .
Because the navy needs bodyguards for the officer corps and a expeditionary force , too .
Leave the fucking Marines alone .
They 're one of the few organizations I still have some respect for in this nation .
To be honest , the Army is a great service .
I have served with several stellar performers from 2 ID and 3 rdArmored .
Got friends in the 101 and 82 nd Airborne or Airmoble .
The bottom line ( and the hook and sinker ) is that man for man , and dollar for dollar the Army can not match the "@ kick in the door @" specialty that our Marines do .
BTW I did a force on force with the 10 th Mountain in the late 80 's .
They were attempting to go @-@ light and were using our FMFM 's to teach em techniques .
And besides , they Ai n't Ready to be Marines Yet .
You just know I have to weigh in on this one !
Each service and the Marines have their unique roles .
There are of course some similarities and overlap between them .
That is what allows the US military great flexibility in operational execution .
Funding will always be an issue .
Each service thinks their requirements are more important than the other service 's .
Because not everything gets funded , we go to war with the military we have and not the military we want .
Obviously , there has been interservice rivalry since the first ship went to sea with fighting men on board .
The army has brotherhood beef with the marines but we recognize that the marines are a unique unrivaled infantry machine .
The Army has the ability to meet any infantry requirement anywhere and is set up for long term missions .
The long term ability of the army mesh 's with the immediate ferocity of the Marines .
They are far from the same and if combined would defeat the purpose of their original designs .
A funny story ( at least to me ) .
I have two sons in the Marine Corp , both of whome recently completed their MOS training and headed to their permanent duty stations .
One of them went through MOS school at Fort Leonard Wood , MO .
He was telling me that the Army trainee 's had top salute the Marines ( no matter their rank ) @....
that to me shows the respect that the Army has for the elite US fighting force @...@ and a respect that would be lost if they were part of the Army .
He also told me that the Air Force guys got additional pay for being stationed on the same base as Marines and that the Marines were not allowed to go round in groups of more than 4 , because they were concerned about what they could do to anyone .
Be afraid @...@ be very afraid @....@ USMC all the way !!!!
Man , how the hell can people do this ??
And a Mother especially @.....@ where is the Motherly love and the Mother instinct to protect her children ??
Blind rage is just that @- blind .
I once found myself holding a steak knife @- ready to plunge it into my chest .
And I did , in my mind .

But by some other force , I did n't .
I still do n't know why .
It was one of but two miracles that I 've witnessed in my life .
Folks black out so to speak .
They black out to one singular vision that is a reality of past present and future . And for that I hold them ( and once myself ) harmless .
Drugs . Valle had over 20 different kinds of drugs she was taking .
It 's a wonder she could find the bathtub .

I want to say something else too though .
I watched a documentary about Tyson once , it was one that focused more on his fighting career than his personal life .
My god , as a boxer that young man was simply awesome - and that is not a word that I use very often .
If I remember correctly he won 19 out of his first 20 professional fights by first round knock out , generally consummated by a left @-@ upper @-@ cut struck on the jaw that would lift a 220 @-@ pound man two feet off the mat .
Its impossible to compare athletes from different eras .
In golf alone the equipment is so much better now than it was even 10 years ago let alone 20 or 30 years ago .
Its also impossible to compare the competition levels .
I do n't think Tyson was ever slated to be the greatest boxer of all time .
Regardless of his skills , he never had the competition during his era to be considered the greatest
Ali defeated Liston , Frazier , Norton and Forman who were all better than anyone Tyson ever faced
I found out today that the Blockbuster Video that I go to is closing down .
This is the fourth store in my area to close in the last year , and I 'm actually a bit upset about it , because the few that remain are n't close enough to drive to .
Blockbusters already drove the mom and pop videostores out of business , and they are being driven out by movies on line , movies on demand , and movies by mail @- businesses they are trying to get into .
I guess some would call this progress , but I think we are losing something as well .
Redbox is a simpler version of Blockbuster , in that you can still go to a Redbox and browse and get a movie right then and there .
I actually prefer the Redbox because it does n't have nearly as much selection .
Enough but not so much that I stand there for an hour , you know ?
All of the Blockbusters around us closed down .
You can get some great deals on movies / tv shows as they unload their inventory .
They drop the prices each week so if you 're looking for something in @-@ particular , nows a good time to keep an eye out for it .
Also , when ours closed down they offered a free movie ( that you were buying anyways , I think whatever the cheapest movie you were purchasing ) and a month free of Blockbuster online ( it 's like Netflix ) .
You can just cancel before the one month timeframe is over .
I took them up on the offer @... good deal .
For me , part of the fun of renting movies was going to the store with your chick and picking them out , bullshitting with other people in the store , etc.
God forbid we have to leave the house for an hour and move our limbs .

I assume he assumed after reporting it up the chain that something would be done .
I do though think the school made the right move last night , just wish Joe had been able to go out on a more positive note after what he 's done for nearly fifty years at PSU .
Wish him a long and happy retirement .

The local papers are of the opinion that , whomever won the leadership contest , the Labour Party was likely to be heavily damaged going into next year 's elections .
Local OWS activists were part of this protest .
File this under "@ Holy S*** ! @"
Hundreds of protesters from various groups converged on the state capitol in Topeka , Kansas today .
Shortly before the protesters arrived , Capitol Police discovered a truck laden with explosives parked outside the capitol .
Yeah , this sounds like bullshit .
One , the protesters were not targeted .
That 's an invention of the blog reprinting this .
Second , I have a really hard time believing that there were any ACTUAL "@ explosives , @" since the news story they link to talks about one guy getting arrested for THREATENING Governor Brownback .
Nothing about explosives charges , etcetera , which they 'd be quick on top of if there were any actual explosives .
Given the way these stories get exaggerated , "@ several improvised explosive devices @" could mean anything down to a few bundles of firecrackers -- or nothing at all , since false reports are n't at all uncommon .
Doubly so since they apparently did not even bother to tow the truck , so clearly there was n't a serious threat .
Translation out of hype @-@ speak @: some kook made threatening noises at Brownback and got arrested . The end .
Of what Am I trying to convince you ?
I 'm expressing my own views here .
What you believe is of concern only in terms of debate .
And possibly adding to my knowledge if I 'm convinced there 's justification .
So far , NOT .
If that article represents the final word on "@ substance @" to you , that 's fine with me .
I am , and remain skeptical .
I 'm sure they found something .
Hard to make any case at all without something tangible .
What it is , who put it there , and why remain , for me , unknown , and also remain deciding factors for me .
Wingnut / Hard for me to grasp . Goodness , disagreeing with you causes personal attacks . Not hard to believe when considering the weakness of your argument .
This is excellent news , we needed a counter balance !
It was revealed in January that Rupert Murdoch / News Corp were creating the right wing spanish version of Fox News .
1 . what makes u think these channels will be a counter balance to anything lol nt
2 . Because when all else fails , I still trust in Mickey !
3 . Disney 's ABC Network has been rated the second most conservative news coverage .
Still , a conservatively biased channel is preferable to a conservative propaganda channel , which is what the Fox Spanish channel will certainly be .
4 . How is Univisions coverage ?
I understood that it was a center left network .
I turned on my coputer this morning and instead of opening the internet to my Google home page ( White ) it opened to a page called "@ Blackle @" which was black .
I thought , hmm , they do funny things with the Google letters for holidays , so maybe today is Blackle Wednesday or something .
I "@ Blackled @" it and found out they changed the page to black to save energy .
Does this make sense ?
Any teeth to this and if so , does it make enough of a differrence for web developers to switch ?
I just Googled Google and when I click on the first selection it takes me to the white Google page , so apparently we still have a choice .
The new search from Google has the Blackle.com address , not google .
Also , when we have a choice for skins , like I think we do ( or did at one time ) here on A2K , then we could all contribute to the energy savings by using the black skin , right ?
So , we could participate that way , too .
( Although I find the black page harder to read . )
Anyone familiar with the workings of energy that could explain the black page using less ?
Or , whether or not it is that significant ?
Only so long as they have no redeeming qualities , I imagine .
It is always wrong to kill anybody , whatever they have done .
I heard it costs upwards of one million dollars to execute one prisoner ; that sure buys a whole lot of years in prison .
A concurrent thread has touched on the the role of religion in the US Civil Rights movement , and its place in the US constitution .
Is the "@ equality @" issue "@ religious wish fulfilment @" which flies in the face of biological and sociological "@ fact @" ?
I think you are answering if two men are the "@ same @" and not necessarily if they are equal in rights or should be .
T K O
I see equality as a goal to strive for , although in effect , it is somewhat arbitrary , dependant on the whims of changing times .
While riding the bus earlier this week , I overheard a man say that if he "@ had the guts to do it , @" he would jump off an overpass .
He followed up with an affirmation that he would never do it because he would never find those guts .
We are probably all familiar with the traditional saying regarding suicide - that it is a "@ coward 's way out . @"
My question is this @: Is it really ? Or is it the opposite ?
That is , does the act of suicide actually require courage to commit ?
Personally I believe it requires a tremendous amount of courage and perhaps the greatest amount of courage of any possible action .
After all , we are speaking of terminating one 's own life , perhaps forever ending one 's existence .
We all have our thoughts on what comes next , but no one can be certain .
One may be forever ending his existence , or he may be forever subjecting himself to punishment if the religious views on suicide being a sin are correct .
Either way though , one is entering the unknown by willingly terminating his life , which blatantly violates the biological drive to live , to continue existing .
How can this not be an extremely courageous act , much more so that "@ finding the courage to remain alive in the face of unbeatable problems ? @"
Remaining alive to face one 's problems is continuing the state of existence that one has always known .
Ending that life is journeying into something new , something that may be better or may be worse than the current state of existence the individual is comfortably familiar with .
Either way he is terminating his life and accepting the state of death that deep down we all fear .
How can one consider voluntarily entering that state cowardly ?
@Elmud , Well , I think your reasoning has merit @:
[INDENT] One is fearful of some thing One overcomes their fear to do that thing In so doing , one can therefore said to have courage [/INDENT]
So yes ; strictly speaking , I think you 're correct .
Although I must admit , it strikes me as very unproductive to give praiseworthy words to such an act .
"@ He had the courage to kill himself @" ; though correct in this sense , leads to a '@ destructive @' conclusion .
As a side note , labeling it as a "@ cowardly @" or "@ easy @" way out - I think - is simply people using derision to express their disapproval .
Such disapproval may be certainly warranted - and I disapprove of it generally - but what one must go through ( mentally , emotionally and / or experiencially ) can hardly be called "@ easy @" .
I can also envision a state where , for me , such a solution could be warranted ; not a good one to be sure , but conceivable nonetheless .
To fight with every last stitch of breath for even the most @-@ remote possibility for "@ things getting better @" is what I hold to .
Interesting twist on the issue . Thanks for posting
@WithoutReason , It is a purely courageous act , especially if you prepared for it so that it was least painful for your loved ones .
I do n't know if it could be argued as a logical choice , per se , especially if you had not yet tried letting go of all the things that bring you down ( psychologically speaking ) .
But , if you just got your arms and legs blown off by and IED , then by all means , have at it . ( Err @...@ have someone do it for you . )
According to most analyses , from within and without the petroleum Industry , the world supply of oil , relative consumption , will effectively peak in the next decade .
What does this mean ?
If demand exceeds supply , someone will necessarily have to go without .
The issue is who ?
Some nations will be priced out , most likely the relatively undeveloped countries in which automotive transportation is not really essential .
However , when there is not enough oil to satisfy even the industrialized nations , which totally depend on oil not only for transportation , but for farming , various chemicals industries , etc. , how will they likely respond ?
Obviously , war is a possiblity ; they have been fought for far less in the past .
Of course , access to petroleum itelf is not the only issue .
Most of the world 's food is grown using modern farming methods that require enormous amounts of gas .
If the amount of surplus food suddenly decreases as a result of peak oil , the poor around the world will starve , lamentable in itself , causing instabilities that could lead to conflict over scarce resoures .
China comes to mind .
The economy of that nation is being built , with questionable logic by the central planners , on the western model @: i.e. dependent on cheap petroleum .
What is unique about China is that the ruling party 's legitmacy is intimately assosciated with rapid economic progress .
If this were suddenly to halt or risk collapse , would that ruling party push the country into war , either to acquire access to oil or simply as a distraction , as so many authoritarian regimes have done in the past ?
There is shift of power occurring in Asia , as China and Russia exert their influence .
The Shangai Cooperation Organization of which they , along with Ian , Pakistan and most of the former Soviet republics , are memebers , has stated that it intends to remove U.S. influence from the region and failitate the rise of a '@ multi @-@ polar world . @'
I do n't want to guess their specific motives , but it seems to me that such an arrangement could be very advanategous for those nations in the event of a crisis brought on by peak oil .
Between Russia and Iran , they would have access to enormous oil reserves , from which they could , if supplies were too short , deny the U.S. Saudi Arabia comes to mind as well .
As anyone who has done even the most superficial research on that nation would know , the House of Saud is a joke , a paper tiger and a tyranny hated by most of its people .
If elections were held their , or if there was a struggle for power , the regime that woudl arise would be friendly with Iran and extremely antagonistic to the U.S. @: quite understandably I might add .
With the largest oil reserves in the world , it is vital that the U.S. maintain contorl over Saudi Arabia , which means propping up the House of Saud , and it would be equally benificial to Iran or to China and its partners in Asia to facilitate a revolution there , which would allow them greater access by default .
And so , after all that , which you might justly consider paranoia , my question is basically this ; in light of the threat of peak oil , and of the general decline in American economic might relative the rest of the world ( not to mention the current U.S. crisis ) , what do think the world will look like in a decade or two ?
If American hegemony fails , as appears inevitable , what will be its replacement ?
Nice post and important issue .
I really , really hope that alternative sources are being as enthusiastically @-@ pursued as the urgency of the situation dictates they should .
But the first , perhaps facetious , response I had to "@ what would happen @" @-@ question was to recall the 80 's movies @: Mad Max , and Mad Mad @: Road Warrior
I 'll admit though @: There 's a part of me that wants to see all this fossil @-@ fuel B.S. come tumbling down .
Even if it set transportation , technology and civilization in general back some , I 'd think a "@ reboot in a better direction @" ( read @: away from finite resources , fossil fuels ) is so much the better .
Yea , more war over oil resources is likely ; perhaps even inevitable .
There is no question that the coming century will see a confluence and will be a critical turning point in human history .
Peak oil will be one of the primary drivers of this process .
We may very well be called upon to choose between collective life and death .
The potential is there for both .
If we so choose to do so the technology we will have available in the near term future is perfectly capable of salvaging the situation .
But if we do n't and we allow our technological civilisation to collapse under its own weight , the next generations of humans will have to do without the major stepping stone of an oil based economy .
There simply will not be enough oil left .
They may not be able to kickstart their own industrial era .
I think what you are going to see is a shift towards localized economies .
As the oil supply becomes smaller and population grows there just will not be enough to feed the system .
Hopefully , people realize that it is going to take oil to move beyond oil , so the focus should be using what is readily available wisely , before the shift becomes extremely expensive .
I just Read of Arthur C Clark 's death in Sri Lanka -- he is primarily know as a science fiction author , but his science fiction presaged many of the technologies that we now consider plebian .
His prediction of geosychronous satellites in the 40 's are now so utilitarian that this 24 hour equatorial orbit is now known as the Clark orbit ,
Many other of his '@ fictions @' have now become casual technology .
I remember when he did that show "@ mysterious universe @" about enigmas and theories about things like Easter island , great pyramids , and Stonehenge .
Great man , great body of work , a truly enlightened soul who will revisit us again I 'm sure .
See you in the blink of an eye , buddy .
This was sad news .
I enjoyed his books and his perspective on things .
Another giant gone .
Shame nobody ( except a quoted person ) spelled his name right .
I could n't for the life of me figure out where to post this question , so I thought I 'd put it here since it 's biologically relevant @... somewhat .
Do n't ask me why but I need to know what happens if you dye your eyebrows .
Say you want to disguise yourself by bleaching dark hair blonde and that you wanted to do the eyebrows as well to complete the disguise .
Now the hair on your head will eventually grow and you 'll lose the blonde @-@ ness , but what about the eyebrows ?
I do n't remember ever having them cut or trimmed , so would they stay blonde ?
Eyebrows have a different "@ terminal length @" than head @-@ hair -- that is , they grow to a certain length ( and not longer ) , then fall out .
They 're still going through the growth process , though .
The old ones fall out , the new ones fall in .
So it 'd have to be re @-@ done at intervals , yep .
This excessive concern with little eyebrows is a trifle odd .
I do n't think soz is looking to disguise herself .
I think she 's on the vamp .
According to Darwin it is the males who do the vamping .
What 's the scientific explanation of the reversal in humans ?
Its the same with long @-@ haired dogs and short @-@ haired dogs .
The short haired dog has hair strands that ( on the average ) fall out or break before the average long @-@ haired dog 's .
Eyebrow hairs grow much slower than head hair , so if you dye everything together , your head hair will show "@ roots @" long before the eyebrows do .
I dye my eyebrows all the time , whether I 'm doing a touch up to the roots , or my entire head .
So , that 's every 2 weeks .
I do n't know how fast my eyebrows grow , but after 2 weeks there 's always a grey one in there somewhere .
I guess they grow as fast as women seem to need to pluck them .
BTW , when you 're dying them , use a Q-tip , and make sure you get it all the way to the root .
I rather suspect that the "@ there is a GOD who always was -- and the GOD created what we see and can infer exists @" scenario has more appeal forl you .
Am I correct ?
A "@ Theory @" is nothing more than an explanation of known facts @...@ when and if the facts change , the theory would be expected to change . Therefore , any proposed "@ Theory @" that is not supported by known facts is to be rejected . However , support for any one theory does not
automatically lead to a rejection of a second or even a third if those
theories are also supported by the facts .
Facts , not interpetations , are the basis for evaluation . An open and
curious mind and a regard for truth are still the basis for good science .
Media coverage and political support are not .
It 's a common argument that the Universe is tuned "@ just so @" for life to exist , and that any slight modification means that "@ life @" would be impossible .
But this premise assumes that life as we know it is the only form of life that *@ can @* exist . And I disagree with this assumption .
The life we see around us evolved in this Universe as conditions allowed , so it 's not surprising at all that everything fits nicely . Other Universes with different rules would necessarily have life in them which fits that universe . And Universes which are sterile have no life in them to question the fact that they are not there .
The really interesting thing to realize is that life evolves in Universes ( at least this one ) at all . Is the evolution of life in a Universe pure chance , or is it inevitable ?
In our universe at least , life not only can exist , but does exist . And that means that our Universe is itself , alive , in a very real sense . And we are its thoughts .
A variant on the multi universe which seems to me obvious , and very real , is the infinite universe .
Here the universe that we perceive is simply one cell of infinity , the others being like or unlike "@ cells @" beyond our own , but filling the remainder of "@ everything @" beyond our specific "@ this @" with "@ otherthings @" , identical , or not .
If we look at the magnitudinal stratification of this universe we go from , as we interpret it , and with our current ability to decern at sub nano levels , the smallest subatomic particles through atoms , molecules , solids , constructs , and on , and on , and on , to planets , star systems , galaxies , and on to our entire known universe .
Would it not be foolish to assume this "@ Mandelbrot @" like lattice would stop at the extreem of our meagre ability to observe , rather than continue to follow its serial makeup to unimagined levels of structure , and beyond to infinity ( infinity , of course not being a point , but rather a lack of constraint quantifier ) .
multiverse
I was working on a research project on the concept of the multiverse and while I enjoyed the incoherent rambling argument on whether there is a god or not Im feeling kind of empty . The universe is the way it is because if it were n't then we would n't be able to contemplate on whether therte is a god or not . And trying to justify the existence of god through anything dealing with relativity is laughable . God is only able to exist through faith . And faith goes against everything that science stands for .
A key issue in disscussion of "@ life @" and "@ universes @" is what constitutes "@ structure @" or "@ order @" . For example , to take BGW 's ( and Capra 's ) fractal model of embedded "@ structures @" we are still left with the regression problem of " who observes / defines such structure @" .
My own conclusion is that terms like "@ multiverse @" have no separate reality with respect to a singular concept whilst the criteria for "@ reality @" concern explanation of what we call "@ events @" in the single universe . I am saying that the occurrence of "@ life @" is not an "@ event @" in the usual sense because events presuppose "@ observers @" who classify them as such . ( Observation in "@ our minds eye @" is cognitive sleight of hand ) Note also the term "@ multi @" implies "@ one who classifies or counts @" and we can ask again who is this other than ourselves ?
In short , the corollary the universe appears like it is because we are like we are is equally valid .
The transcendent question is of course "@ what constitutes explanation " and how can this encompass the interaction of observer and observed ?
Rather than take a reductionist view proposing infinite , slightly different universes that somehow interact ( alah M-Theory ) , allow for strong emergence via the Landauer @-@ Lloyd analysis of flaws in the of the Laplace 's demon argument that supports reductionists . Basically this states the final outcome of a system may not be soley defined by outcomes written into the basic laws of physics * a gazzillion atoms , but there can be "@ a cosmic imperative @" written into the laws of nature ( Paul Davies - Macquarie Uni - Sydney , Australia - Emergent biological principles and the computational resources of the universe , Complexity vol 10 ( 2 ) , p1 @"
So basically ultra complex systems can produce weird outcomes ; such as rocks , intelligent life or high temperature superconductors all from the same raw materials - simply arranged slightly differentally . This might bring down the number of universes required to create life from infinite to merely fairly large !
Can we PLEASE get these people a voice in Washington ?
How long are we supposed to wait to see if this womans brain will ever rewire effectively before we move on ?
We Americans have let our victim fetish get so bad that we are pathetic .
If I were in AZ-08 , I think this would be a fair question but I 'm not sure of what the mechanism to remove a Congresswoman is other than the ballot box .
Strom Thurmond was not all there but still held his office with the consent of his constituents .
I think as long as her constituents are ok with it , we do n't get a say .
As Butrflynet pointed out , Gabrielle Gifford 's office is doing quite a lot .
That does n't seem incidental or trivial to me .
Gabrielle Giffords was voted in because people agreed with her policies and approach to politics .
She hand @-@ selected this group of people who now make up her office , with the intent of working together to implement her vision .
In that way , she is still the representative , as these people take her stated vision and priorities and work to make them happen .
If Giffords is unable to recover fully before the next election , I think it would make sense that her second @-@ in @-@ command , or whomever has been most instrumental in the work that her office has been doing since the injury , goes ahead and runs in her place .
I think engineer 's point about not encouraging removal from office by gunshot is a good one .
The members of the minority party in the House of Representatives are largely ciphers anyway , although only a few of them have the excuse that they suffer from medically certifiable brain damage .
All the Democrats in the house could take a year @-@ long vacation and the results would largely be the same , so Giffords 's absence from her duties is hardly consequential .
Indeed , the country would benefit if more congressmen could be induced to take extended breaks from their duties .
It might be a good idea to keep track of this woman . Some basics from her wiki biography might be helpful .
The Congresswoman , who is about to turn 55 , was born in Iowa . When her parents divorced , she moved to Minnesota with her mother . She worked in a kibbutz after high school , attended Winona State University , the now defunct law school at Oral Roberts University and the William and Mary Law School where she took a master 's degree in tax law .
She has been married for 30 years . "@ Bachmann and her husband own a Christian counseling clinic in Stillwater , Minnesota .
Bachmann also has an ownership stake in Waumandee , Wisconsin farm land . Since the death of her father-in-law , the farm and its buildings have been rented out to a neighboring farmer who maintains a dairy herd on the farm . From 1995 through 2006 , the tenant @-@ farmer received $ 251,973 in federal subsidies , chiefly for dairy and corn price supports . @"
Initially a Democrat , she became disillusioned with Jimmy Carter . In 1976 , the CHristian documentary by Francis Schaeffer , "@ How Should We Then Live ? @" impelled her to take up an anti @-@ abortion stance and she and her fiance began praying outside abortion facilities .
"@ In 1993 , Bachmann and other parents started a K-12 charter school in Stillwater , and she began speaking against a state @-@ mandated set of educational standards , which propelled her into the world of politics .
Bachmann became an outspoken critic and opponent of Minnesota 's School @-@ to @-@ Work policies . In a 1999 column , she wrote @: "@ School @-@ to @-@ Work alters the basic mission and purpose of K-12 academic education away from traditional broad @-@ based academic studies geared toward maximizing intellectual achievement of the individual . Instead , School @-@ to @-@ Work utilizes the school day to promote children 's acquisition of workplace skills , viewing children as trainees for increased economic productivity . @" @*
* My reaction @: what a surprise .
I love Michele Bachmann !
With any luck , she will be the Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential race .
A dream opponent for the dems , really .
Now , if her running mate were to be someone named Turner , the dems could be in trouble , like , a Bachmann @-@ Turner ticket would blow them off the road once the campaign got into overdrive .
Doubt if she 'd adopt an anti @-@ vocational ed stance , though .
All I know , is the more I see her on television , the better .
Youtube @: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAaDVOd2sRQ
@33export ,
I 'm not certain that everyone will "@ get @" the reference to Bachmann @-@ Turner . The Canadians , however , will .
@plainoldme ,
It made me laugh ( and I am American ) .
Thats only because you ai n't seen nothing yet .
@maxdancona ,
My comment was simply a reply to the backhanded reference to BTO .
IMHO , Michele Bachmann is not as sharp as a bowling ball and has no business even thinking about running for President .
I love watching Michele Bachmann . She is funnier than any sitcom on television . Bad thing is she makes Mitt Ronmey look very solid . I mean , compared to Palin and Bachmann , Romney sounds like Einstein LOL .
@jcboy ,
I believe that Bachmann has a real chance of beating Romney for the nomination . I think it will come down to the two of them , and Romney 's negatives , from being a Mormon to having taken so many positions in the past that annoy conservatives .
A "@ selection of recent articles on the Republican presidential wannabe and Tea Party darling @" , from the New Statesman HERE
@Walter Hinteler ,
As amusing as a Bachmann candidacy would be , itll never happen . There are some intelligent people in the RNC who realize that this would be tantamount to handing over the presidential race to Obama without firing a shot . The RNC is scared that the public may love her like they do Sarah . With the GOP trying to find its "@ center of mass @" they are p [ arading out these clowns that can only cause them big trouble in November 2012
It 's that time again .
Politicians running for mid-term elections are attacking their opponents and in doing so , stretching truths where ever they may be found .
I want to get a list of fact check websites going .
It 'd be interesting to see if different sites come up with the same facts @....
i figure someone should just start a website called They All Lie dot com and just post pics of all the candidates , that would certainly make it easier
I 'm kind of cynical that fact even matter anymore .
We 've left the information age , we are well into the opinion age .
That idiotic GOP "@ Pledge to America @" was ripped to shreds by Factcheck.org , but it will n't matter because those who believe it ( or at least believe in the idea of it ) will n't ever dare venture near a fact checking source .
I think we need a new web service that fact checks , but also tracks who comes and reads the facts .
You must have been reading the Pledge to America , in which the GOP promises to return the country to failed Bush policies of borrow and spend and the elimination of oversight and regulation .
It was his policies that brought us a net job loss over ten years ( first in history ) , banks that became , in essence , hedge funds , sleazy sub-prime mortgage loans , torture , corruption , etc.
Moreover , privatizing social security and Medicare is a prescription for disaster .
( Check with the Brits who went through this relative to their version of social security . )
While the hostilities between internal factions of the clerical regime and their feuding over the sham election is escalating , the people of Tehran , particularly young people , demonstrated in their thousands in different parts of the city including Fatemi Street , Vali @-@ Asr Street and Square , Vanak Square , Shariati Street , Takht-e-Tavoos Street and Sa'adatabad against the illegitimate and fraudulent election .
Whereas I take every single word uttered by Israel with a grain of salt the size of Jupiter , even I can smell the stink from that election .
Dear Fellow American , This 4 th of July , while you and your family celebrate the 230 th Anniversary of the founding of our great nation , there 's one party you will n't be invited to @...

You see , this party is n't to honor your freedoms -- but to conspire to take them away .
Over our July 4 th holiday , on American soil , they are preparing to enact a legally @-@ binding treaty that would give the U.N. unchallengeable power to ban civilian ownership of ALL firearms .
That means your rifles , your shotguns and your handguns . AND YOUR FREEDOM !
To learn what you can do to stop the U.N. 's global gun ban treaty @-@ before it destroys our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms visit www.stopungunban.org .
Just as a handful of patriots fired the "@ shot heard '@ round the world @" at Concord Bridge , it 's up to you and me and every patriot who cherishes our Bill of Rights to tell the world today that our nation will not be bullied by the U.N.
Thank you for acting today .
Throw 'em out , and drop out .
This organization has been financed with U.S. tax dollars since its inception , and all it does it feed off of the money and try to kill the host . F--- 'em .
Odd , such an extensive website about the threat of this global gun ban treaty , a dozen webpages at least -- and it does n't actually seem to have a single link to the actual text of said proposed ban .
Do n't those NRA members want to check out for themselves what the text actually says ?
Do n't you think it 's odd ?
Do n't you want to know what that ban treaty actually says ?
The treaty can be found here @..
It seems that LaPierre is in support of criminals based on the what this treaty does .
Try reading the UN treaty when you sober up cj @..
you might find it is n't even close to what you desperately want to think it is .
What makes you think the NRA lets little facts like that get in the way of stirring up fear ?
Like the UN is going to actually demand that we close our firearm factories , and they are just going to lock the doors because of this treaty .
Lethal injection Electric chair Gas Chamber Hanging Firing Sqaud
Who cares , would you rather have your hard earned tax dollars spent by keeping them behind bars .
I would n't .
Lethal injection followed by hanging .
Firing squad is probably pretty quick , but I do n't know that it 's used much .
The electric chair and gas chamber are nothing short of barbaric .
On the ballet I filled out yesterday , there was a Constitution party running for president .
I tried to look up their website , but it was blocked at work .
So this even peaked my curiosity even more ( as the other candidates websites are not blocked ) .
Anyone have a clue ?
Here is their mission statement .
Interesting - I have n't heard of them before and was curious .
What could have been so offensive that the website was blocked ?
Obama 's view that affirmative action should , after these many years , continue may lead to his defeat in November .
And this may be the correct result .
Affirmative action equates to discrimination against nonbeneficiaries , usually while males . Obama says he is against quotas , but so-called goals are invariable set up .
Moreover , the goals are a euphemism for quotas .
Obama should assidiously avoid the AA term and instead embrace programs the benefit the economically disadvantaged , regardless of race , gender , or ethnic origin .
Depends on how it 's framed .
By far , the largest group benefiting from affirmative action is @.... wait for it @..... WHITE WOMEN .
Affirmative action has been essential in allowing women to break into some high paying , male dominated fields .
Many of these fields are clearly still male dominated in the management areas .
All Obama has to do it make the point , repeatedly , that McCain 's position is anti @-@ women and he is for increasing the roles women play in the workplace and he 's got a winner .
What is telling is that even when talking about Obama 's "@ defeat @" the other guy never gets mentioned .
If this prediction were true I would think one would consider it what 's his name 's "@ victory @" rather than Obama 's defeat .
They can n't both lose @...
The funny thing is that more Americans support Affirmative Action than oppose it ( this Gallup Poll shows 49 @-@ 43 in favor of AA for racial minorities ) .
The Conservatives do n't understand that turning the majority of Americans into "@ liberals @" is not a good electoral strategy ( as they saw in the 2006 elections and will see again in November ) .
I 'm always surprised to see affirmative action discussed in terms of liberal / conservative .
My brother , who is a General in the US Army , self identifies as conservative but is a BIG believer in affirmative action .
I self identify as a moderate liberal and definitely identify as a woman am not nearly the supporter he is .
So I 'm just going to read along to see if the why of this being a liberal v. conservative issue becomes any clearer @......
Quotas are racist .
There is no getting around it .
They are a means of making a choice based on race .
Why does it surprise anyone that Obama would support quotas ?
Obama is n't against ALL racism , just some of it .
Are Those Who Question 9 / 11 Anti @-@ Semites ?
Anti @-@ semitism is one of the most frequent allegations levied by defenders of the government 's version of 9 / 11 against people questioning that account .
Is it true ?
Are 9 / 11 activists really anti @-@ semites ?
Not anti @-@ semites .
Just anti @-@ logical
So out of the 70 million American voters who say we need new 911 investigations there are no Jews ?
Not likely .
This post is based on the incorrect statement that @:
"@ Anti @-@ semitism is one of the most frequent allegations levied by defenders of the government 's version of 9 / 11 against people questioning that account . @"
No . Anti @-@ Semitism is not the most frequent accusation against those that question the governments explanation of 9 / 11 .
Only when obvious anti @-@ Semites try to say "@ the Jews did it , @" might that allegation made .
And , that I thought was a version of 9 / 11 that is accepted in many Muslim countries as the most popular notion .
Unfortunately , anti @-@ Zionism and anti @-@ Semitism have been melded in the popular culture by many people .
So , anti @-@ Zionists often become anti @-@ Semites , rather than do the intellectual efforts to parse the two concepts .
I saw Clinton on a show this weekend .
When asked why no economists support her tax holiday plan , she said they were elitists who do n't understand the pain the common man is in .
Just to review , Clinton and McCain have proposed eliminating the federal gas tax of $ 0.18 / gallon during the summer driving season .
McCain says he will pay for it with spending reductions , Clinton with taxes on oil companies .
Obama ( and all economists ) say this is a bad idea and results in insignificant savings .
There is no support for this in Congress and the President has denounced it .
If the tax is repealed , several commentators feel the refiners will take some for themselves since they have also been hurt by rising prices .
What burns me is the "@ elitist @" comment applied to economists .
We tell our children to work hard , get a good education and become experts in their fields , but if they disagree with a politician , they become latte drinking elitists out of touch with the hard working common man .
Is n't this just what Bush has done to the scientific community in miniture ?
Is n't advice from experts required to run a country like the US ?
I 'm sure there are some economists of priviledge out there as well as some who propose solutions based on theories without regard to the impact of their ideas , but Clinton does n't have any economists who support her proposal , so what 's the deal ?
( I do n't know about McCain 's beliefs since Clinton has been doing the heavy lifting so far . )
interesting I think , is the poll released this morning on MSNBC detailing that 45 % think the gas tax holiday is a good thing while 49 % think it 's bad .
whatever , I think it 's just plain sleazy .
Engineer Engineer , I repeat my response on another of your topics .
I agree with you and Dyslexia .
Hillary Clinton 's desperation "@ gas vacation @" proposal is about the last straw with me .
She has really demeaned herself as far as I 'm concerned .
It 's not only her pandering , it 's that the proposal is so stupid .
The oil companies would end up with the money by raising their prices and the public would get nothing .
Hillary Clinton for Senate Majority Leader is now my choice for her . BBB
Clinton and McCain are trying to win votes with nickle and dime stuff ;
our economy is straining so badly , it needs more than $ 600 tax rebates or one @-@ time summer relief from taxes ;
it 's called a ) saving homes of millions of families , b ) our economy , and c ) the war in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Some dunderheads will fall for these gimmicks , and vote for them in November .
I have gone thru countless elections and many things are said in the heat of the campaign .
Hillary once elected might go not thru with it .
That is not to say she lied but that wiser heads may counsel her to pass it up .
Where is Dick Cheney ?
Why has he deserted ?
His absence has been explained many times in many different ways , but he has virtually disappeared from the scene .
This would n't be so important , but he still is the vice president , is n't he ?
Things are looking very muddled right now .
Rumsfeld , who was enjoying a limelight , is now being asked to keep a low profile , since his abrasive personality has alienated so many .
Poor Bush , no matter how many times they parade him , still is n't impressive .
And Powell is beginning to look like a desperate man in search of some dignity .
A lot of public appearance is left to Ari Fleischer , which is his job , but he does n't exactly have such an ingratiating personality either .
Which does n't leave us very much in the way of impressive @-@ looking leadership .
So where is Cheney ?
He 's in the underground command center @....
he 'll resurface soon @...
Maybe he is in a cryogenic chamber right next to Ted Williams .
In other words they are keeping him on ice .
moonlighting for Haliburton
weird , is n't it .
i 've been wondering where he wandered off to .
He 's been '@ off the radar @' for a long time .
But he told us all at the outset that this is the way it would be .
He is spending time in the bowels of Hell with his real boss , plotting and planning .
Yes and getting richer by the day .
Maybe a low profile because his name is now showing up in Arabic and European papers regarding that very same Halliburton bit ?
As Reagan would say here we go again .
K-Mart is closing 326 stores and laying off approximately 35,000 people .
It is almost a daily ritual with the announcement of massive layoffs .
President Bush on the other hand continues to claim the economy is strong , not as strong as it could be but strong nonetheless .
He has however presented a package which he contends will stimulate the economy and create jobs .
Over half of the package $ 367 billion will come by removing the tax on dividends .
What do you think of the package will it stimulate the economy ?
In addition if the economy remains sluggish what are Bush 's chances for re @-@ election ?
Yeah , it 'll stimulate the top ten percent of the wealthy in this country , but will do nothing for our economy .
Money must be put into the hands of the middle class and the poor for our economy to be stimulated .
The best way to accomplish that is to cut everybody 's taxes by ten percent effective January 1 , 2003 .
That 'll pump about a half trillion dollars into our economy . c.i.
Well , I thought it would be nice to see that title somewhere @...@ since I can n't find it in Reality @....
It is wild to me how such an effective , strong , woman -- the closest advisor to the most powerful person in the world -- has garnered no more support , no accolades from women and blacks -- two groups who are always trying to find successful sisters or positive stories of black achievement .
I have noticed a distinct discrimination among women and blacks in whom they will ballyhoo , and whom they will n't .
If any other woman in this country had soared to the heights Condi has reached , it would be Mardi Gras 24/7 @...
Clarence Thomas is unwelcomed among his own race .
The second black person to serve on the SCOTUS .
Even if he had a disfiguring pigment problem and a third leg , if he were the slightest bit liberal -- he 'd have statues and streets named after him already .
I heard a Georgia mayor on NPR today , and was heartened .
He was explaining to the ( of course , liberal ) quizzical reporter how he could be a Republican .
It was as if he had to apologize to the entire black community @...
I was proud that he told the reporter he felt racially stereotyped to be expected to be a Democrat .
He should n't be expected to be anything .
It is to the great , abiding shame of women and blacks to turn their backs on the great achievements of these people .
It is the New Racism ; by blacks against blacks .
The New Feminist Sexism . Appalling .
Some liberals do n't much cotton to "@ uppity @" blacks like Powell , Thomas and Rice confronting racial discrimination and outright racism and leaving the plantation of dependency on white liberals and achieving the great things they are capable of .
Gotta @' keep 'em in their place , you know .
What does women or black have to do with it .
Clinton had a women secretary of state , and Rice does not represent blacks , so what is your beef ?
What amuses me about Rice is that she lived in the South during the Civil Rights movement , and that experience seems to have left her untouched .
Yet Bush mentioned that background as though she actually did anything beyond striving toward her own growth .
More power to her for her achievements .
But do n't be surprised if you 're not hearing wild applause from her community , because I 'm not sure she has one @...
Assuming she establishes a credible name for herself as Secretary of State , I am cautiously anticipating the GOP nominee in 2008 to be Condoleeza Rice .
And yes , I think she can be elected easily assuming that the GOP is allowed something close to a level playing field .
I think Colin Powell against Gore or Kerry in the last two elections would have won by a landslide .
Americans , especially Republican Americans , have largely left issues of racism and / or stereotypical prejudice and bigotry well behind them .
Any qualified person with charisma and a track record can compete with clout .
I keep hearing that inflation is under control .
And I suppose it is if one does not need to put food on the table , buy gasoline , heating oil , electricity and many of the necessities of life .
From your prospective do you find inflation to be a non @-@ factor ?
Did n't seem to have much effect on the last couple of yachts I bought .
Now , I hear that high end housing ( 1 1 / 2 million +@ ) are also holding the line in some areas .
This whole economy seems to be based on the comfort level of the ones referred to by Dubya as his base .
Lock up all scumbags .
Lock 'm up .
Make 'm work .
Break up the gangs .
If you get caught with meth , got to jail @...
there is no unfortunate case .
You had dope its illegal , you knew it was illegal before you had the dope .
And to whomever spoke of the INNOCENCE in prison , Quit talking like that is the norm .
99.9 % of inmates deserve to be there .
I will take those odds in vegas any day .
Please pick Bloomberg to be your vicepresident .
Please read this if you do n't instantly see why @... http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1632736,00.html
He would ensure that moderates , libertarians , and technocrats sick of politics as usual would vote for you .
He is easily among the most competent politicians we have .
He researches and practices evidence based politics and thus virtually every policy he sought no matter how unpopular proved a success .
And he like you knows how to balance budgets without hurting the economy .
He can also pay for the election campaign .
I highly doubt that Bloomberg is going to switch parties .
He 's already an Independent ( switched from Republican ) .
But , offset Hillary 's "@ Northeastern Elite @" and "@ inexperienced @" negatives with Bloomberg 's "@ Northeastern Elite @" and "@ inexperienced @" negatives ? Not so much .
personally i look upon this conflict as the source of 90 % of western @-@ muslim 's confrontation ,
the US needs and so supports Israel , Israel wants to stop attacks on its citizens and so strike on palestinian targets , which in turn results in more attacks on Israel , this increases the number of radical muslims too , which results in attacks against america around the world ( military targets , embassies , and citizens ) resulting in american foreign policy like the war on Iraq and / or Afghanistan , and the circle continues , reactions to actions resulting in reactions , this circle having No beginning and no end
is not easy to solve , but if we try to and start by the issue at core ( palestinian @-@ Israeli conflict ) the rest can be handled ,
i want to start a thread here , that simulates peace negotiations between two sides , palestinians ( me and who ever volunteers ) against Israeli side ( i suppose Volunteer would not mind representing them and any one he chooses )
each side is allowed one posting per day , then after every two posts its discussed freely by all for two days , then each side makes a post , as the palestinian side is the one with most demands lets let them start ( if its ok by all ) ,
i need ur OK guys and Girls .
very true , the same people who said SADDAM violated UN resolutions , seem to forget , ISRAEL has been in violation of UN resolutions for decades .
Give up hell , tell them to come get it ?
That goes for Isreal too , if Egypt or Syria were anything worthwhile , Isreal would n't of got what they did .
To the victor goes the spoils .
Glad I 've never backed the UN .
Israel is Western , civilized , the progenitors of the first Christian community , and facing total annihilation every day of its life , thanks to being surrounded by psycopathic states .
THEREFORE @.......@ we must back it . :headbang:
So you think if Isreal stopped retaliating , the attacks would stop ?
No chance of that , they would chip at them until they were extinct .
Max Blumenthal goes to the Young Republicans convention in DC , and asks why none of them - who strongly support the WoT and the War in Iraq - have bothered to sign up and serve in the armed forces .
Unsurprisingly , there were plenty of excuses banded about .
Republicans get mad when the '@ Chickenhawk @' argument is brought up , and this is because it is damned effective .
They usually attempt to counter with some version of this line @:
It is n't stupid , though .
There is a perceivable and significant differnce between those who discuss war , who think it is sometimes necessary , and who are willing to do what must be done for US safety ; and the War Cheerleaders .
The actively aggressive advocates of warfare as a solution to life 's problems .
Those are the Chickenhawks @: the ones who continually advocate the solving of our national Foreign policy problems using armed force .
The ones who suggest that the US is so strong , we can go it alone if we have to and we should n't be held back from attacking other countries by little things like , say , international conventions .
They advocate using maximum force to win ; their problem with the war in Iraq is that we are n't killing enough people over there , innocents included .
These people , who cheer on the deaths of others , who think that force is the best way to get what we want - but do n't sign up to serve themselves - are Chickenhawks .
They are too cowardly to put their ass on the line , but continually advocate that others do so .
This topic is right on the money .
These leeches and vultures are the ones getting rich off of the nation 's blood .
They stand safely back , saying , "@ Let 's you and them fight .
Me ? I 'll cheer you on , while me and my friends get rich off your efforts . @"
There was a time when I strongly supported the invasion of Iraq , and it had nothing to do with presenting the good people of Iraq with a democratic form of government .
Oh , I also spent 5 years in the US Army , from a time when most of us had heard of Indochina , through the period when just everybody could name each country in the region .
So , I 'm an oddball . S'okay .
Yes , I would imagiane that Patrick Daniel Tillman most likely did n't need the $ when he enlisted but it is curious why Bush rendered the investigation of his death as a secret of national security .
The Chinese are going to stab us in the back . if we do n't turn away from Iraq and Afghanistan to rebuild / recover our strength . Where they 're financially and militarily , bleeding us to death .
Fine , threaten to sell Aegis equipped ships to Taiwan if they do so .
If China were to do that , they would be cutting their own throats .
The LAST thing that China wants is a weak dollar because that would completely wipe out any chance of a trade surplus from their number one trading partner @... the U.S.
A weak dollar means lots and lots of closed down factories in China because the Americans can n't afford their widgets and doohickies .
They will threaten , they will try to influence , but they will n't '@ drop the bomb @' unless they have a guarantee of some other country willing to buy several hundred billion dollars worth of junk a year .
What do you think the consequences would be ?
Do you think the Shrub could pull it off ?
If not , why ?
His approval rating can not sink , so , what 's the risk .
After all , he 's the Decider , and Congress holds his trousers while he skinny dips .
Does America want us to lose this war and cut and run as Reid and Pelosi have impose upon our president ?
Does America want us to have to fight our way back in in six month or a year with a death toll in multiples of thousands over a radically less period of time ?
Also if we pull out of Iraq and go into Darfur what will be the justification for joining that war , WMD ?
Reid and Pelosi telling the government not to fight America 's war is like congress and the senate telling the government not to fight racism and the KKK a few decades back .
These cowardly democrats are bargaining that Americans will be stupid and not realize the deeper war that will have to be re @-@ fought in only a few short years .
Iran and Russia will be the next war along with Chavez if we do not create a successful democracy in Iraq .
The power vacuum will in Iraq pull Iran and Russia and possibly the whole middle east and maybe even China into an allied front against America .
This my friends is Armageddon .
Reid and Pelosi have been told this I am sure but they simply do n't care .
Winning elections trumps all other concerns @...
Do we really want these people setting public policy ?
Why not leave and let the Iraqis fight the war ?
Answer @: If the Most powerful army is already struggling in this war what will it be like when we pull out and come back in six months to a year ?
Reid and Pelosi stop trying to shove your partisan politics at our president over the generals "@ sound @" military policies .
Listening to your bribe bibber Murtha instead of our generals @...
Seven friggin @' years of this crap is ENOUGH !!!
If we pull out now the disaster will be on YOUR heads just in time for election @...
The blood of freedom is at stake and the very people who claim to value it are now our own worst enemies .
The new democratic KKK selling our freedom and dignity simply for power .
Does America look to geniuses such as yourself for analysis ?
. Now I know you are just kidding , that attitude is just whacky otherwise .
There are tons of examples in history of ill advised "@ proactive @"@ wars , and most of these were eventually lost by the aggressors
Also , rex , try to be civilized and do n't resort to childish name calling .
Its usually a sign of an inability to craft an argument solely based upon the issues at hand .
Just because you feel passionately about this does n't automatically mean that others will embrace your opinions .
OH YEH , AND , if you call me a coward again , Ill come up there to Jonesport , hunt you down , and buy you a drink first .
I 'm thinking Farmerman means what he says .
The day it becomes truly cowardly of one to suggest an end to mindless mayhem is the day I want to float off this planet .
Edgar , you know its a cynical attempt at "@ spin @" by the rapidly sinking SS Bush .
His " handlers @" are trying to cover ytracks and leave a legacy that is goona leve his presidency up there with Harding or Buchanan .
( oy , theres a comparison , Buchanan , I believe started the first of the '@ proactive wars @" against the Mormons ) ,
People like you have done more to screw this country up than "@ the democrats @" could ever have hoped to do .
You repeatedly voted for and supported a president and an administration who was clearly and obviously incompetent and ideologically extreme .
This was evident from campaign through the early years of governance .
You think that America means red , white , and blue and war and think nothing of shredding the constitution on the way to more blood and glory .
And you dare to presume that you are somehow the "@ real Americans @" and the rest of us , those of us who actually know what the Constitution says and know what this ignoramus is trying to do to it , are somehow going to destroy "@ your @" country .
You wave your flag and trust an ignorant incompetent who can n't even run this country to somehow rebuild another , one that he did n't even begin to understand and had never been to .
You trust an idiot .
You think the answer to incompetence and mismanagement is faith .
You and your brethren , the Bush die @-@ hards , have sent this country in a death spiral .
And sadly , the only people we can have any hope of pulling us out are the "@ other party @" .
A party that already was waning in respect due to corruption and its willingness to take some fundamental social justice concepts too far is now supported by a majority of the public , and the beloved party of small government and individual liberties is now a hulking rusty heap of corruption , scandal , incompetence , special interests , big government , and domestic spying .
maybe I am , and maybe I 'm saying that you 're an idiot .
Hard to say exactly . :wink:
You mean SCUT FARKAS and his sidekick @"@ toady @" was Grover Dill , who was actually beaten up by Delbert Bumpus .
I need to set these things correct so that the record will be clear testimonyat Rex 's sanity hearing .
I am a conservative , and you are an idiot .
You said @..
Most Christions I know will not bow to another God , no matter who that God is .
Thats why so many Christians were killed by the ancient Romans , they refused to bow down .
Also , to use an old cliche @...@ "@ I would rather die on my feet then live on my knees @"
I was reading in the paper today about all the laws under consideration that would make it harder for Americans to vote when I suddenly flashed on all the purple fingered Iraqi voters that were so celebrated in our press only a few short years ago .
I think I must be missing something because I 'm really confused by this .
Why would any state do anything that would make it harder for it 's citizens to vote ?
Please can someone explain this to me ?
That 's pretty easy .
Conseratives figure ( and probably with justification ) that their voter base will get out and vote without regard for any minor hurdles which might be thrown in their way .
They rely on older citizens and more affluent citizens .
Anything which makes voting more difficult they figure will reduce the number of voters going to the polls to vote for Democrats .
I do n't have a problem with the first two - provided that they make available photo IDs at no cost to people with limited income and allow clear instructions and make it easy to obtain ( in other words - there are many locations to obtain and enough hours that are varied enough to get these ids ) .
I support having IDs to limit voter fraud , but you can not make it difficult and it should be economically feasible for all to get an ID .
I mean if you make the extra effort to go out and vote - it should n't be much more a burden to get an ID .
The Democrats must return to their progressive program , and must spend the resources necessary to remind the people that the GOP , the right wing , the Tea Party are just plain wrong on the issues .
Hopefully the Massachusetts loss has made Obama go back on the progressive track .
What is interesting about the 2 party system is the people never actually vote FOR a party .
They always vote AGAINST THE OTHER ONE .
The net result is the people are misrepresented 100 % of the time - but amazingly they are so dumb they can n't figure it out .
We asked you @: To save money , should local governments use nonviolent inmates for physical labor ?
That was the question in the other day 's opinion section of my my local newspaper .
YES @: 92.6 % NO @: 7.4 %
So my qestion is this , should gov't turn to slaves to save money ?
@David cv , Depending on country it is already done .
Hard labour , chaingangs , prison farms Voluntary work while incarcerated gets minimal pay etc.
The option as voluntary will at least not require quotas and enforcement through violent means ( beatings ) or witholding of priveledges like food , bedding ( yes bedding ) or outdoor sunlight and isolation . ( legislativ brutality encouragement )
The question is what kind of work is beneficial in a crime and punishment related way .
Some experiements are already implemented in disaster relief bushfires / floods , comunity work as replacement for incarceration . ( Anti social behaviour treatment )
It really depends on the moral standards of the Nation in question .
Forced labour in Europe compared to Africa or America is implemented differently
Have'nt governments / corporations turned their populus trough a monetary reward / tax system into working slaves anyway ?
what 's your thoughts on this ?
i mean , the guy is 88 years old .
Is it really necessary after all these years ?
he 's been here since 1955 and never did a thing to any one .
being a nazi was what was expected of germans back then .
you and i , had we lived there during that time , would probably have been in the same boat .
The head of the OSI is named Rosenbaum , what do you expect ?
While I disagree with you that we 'd all be Nazis , it was over 60 years ago , and the man has obviously reformed .
Expelling him was a political move to strengthen the Zionist stance through a reminder of the holocaust , and serve as a talking point for the anti @-@ Ahmadinejad crowd .
So I was discussing that new tv show on ABC , Commander in Chief , with my grandfather .
He made a comment that was interesting , he said , "@ That show is just the liberal media trying to get us used to the idea of a woman president for when Hillary runs . @"
Now , my grandfather is one of those old , cynical guys that thinks that every sports game that does n't go his way is fixed , and is a tad racest , however , I found the statement intrigueing and made me wonder .
What are your guys @' opinions ?
I 've definitely heard that argument before , and I refuse to watch the dang show .
Ok so I live in MI and maryjane was just legalized in our state .
Well all know why a state would legalize it , but do you really think that it can help somebody ? If so why ?
Think of any other drugs that you feel may help someone .
Think of this . When I was doing crystal , I was in school .
I never missed a day of school .
When I went to my classes tweaking , I paid more attention to what was going on in class .
I went home did ALL of my homework .
I remember lookin at one of my report cards before I started using and my grades were either all d 's or d 's and f 's .
Then I looked at a report card that I got that had ALL a 's on it .
I was soo high on crystal that semester that I do not even remember most what happened at school or at home .
So I ask do you think drugs can be good for some people ?
I know that no matter what no drug is good for anyone .
This does n't mean that I would go back and change things if I could , because I really do not want to .
I am just wondering how other people feel about this .
@secondchance , I think that drugs can have positives but I think that they 'll rarely come without negatives and whether or not it 's a net positive is hard for anyone to tell , most of all the user .
@secondchance , it is possible to self medicate to a positive outcome . responsible use is required .
For instance a couple of generations of artists have widely used drugs , convinced that the change in consciousness is of great help to their work .
We moderns have no doubt but that it is a good idea to drug people up on Ritalin and anti anxiety drugs and antidepressants , this highly drugged society has no basis to complain about weed and coke .
Meth though messes people up big time , so I do n't see a lot of upside to that .
Yes , and I 'm one of them .
My life would be impoverished without my daily glass of wine .
I quite enjoyed the few joints I have tried .
And sometime , when I 'm in a better general mood than I am right now , I 'd like to try LSD or one of its relatives , maybe magic mushrooms .
To me , consuming drugs is a matter of moderation , not abstinence .
My wife has Constant ringing in her ears @: noise , a "@ whooshing @" as she describes .
Any ideas ? THANKS
@RobC , That 's tinnitus .
She should see an otorhinolaryngologist ( ear specialist ; ear , nose and throat specialist ) as , if this is recent , there may be things they can do .
I just watched the most fascinating , inspiring , and yet heartbreaking documentary @: The Half Ton Man .
Obesity is reaching epidemic proportions in the world today .
Is there a fat gene ?
Science seems to think there is .
Many people feel hungry every minute they are awake and fight the fact they know they are literally killing themselves with every bite they take .
One man in the documentary lost 706 pounds !
Yet , when he reached 198 pounds he celebrated by having a hot dog , which turned into two , three , etc.
He now is morbidly obese again and is n't ready to go back into rehab at a center that has great success in helping these people .
When I was younger I could eat virtually anything and not gain weight .
I 'm almost 52 and it 's not quite that easy for me to keep my weight to what is comfortable for me .
I am able to do it , but watching this video scared me . One woman in the video was actually eight feet wide when she got help .
I have seen shows on TV where two year old children weigh nearly 200 pounds all because their parents want to appease the child and stop their fussing .
Does anyone out there have a big problem with their weight ?
How do you combat it ?
Is food an addiction ?
Is over @-@ eating a disease like drug addiction or alcoholism ?
Now , THAT 'S a link ! LOL
I think the problem and cure is psychological . They should spend more time on the psycology of it coupled with the surgery .
Oh , now there getting into that part .
I watched that documentary on Patrick Deuel a while back @....@ too bad he 's gained some weight back .
But there 's always hope he 'll get back on track .
Besides the obvious medical issues with him , I was disturbed by the co @-@ dependant relationship with his wife .
At his worst , he weighed 1,072 pounds .
He was unable to even roll over in bed , let alone get to the refrigerator or supermarket @....
he could n't even get to a phone or a computer to order food if you put it 10 feet away from him .
So @....@ who was feeding his all that crap ?
Who was bringing it to him ?
She feels she 's showing love by bringing him to deaths door because he asked for ( or begged or ranted ) for food .
And not just food @....@ garbage .
I understand love for your spouse , but theirs is not a healthy relationship .
Also , in the video , after he had gotten under 500 pounds , Patrick said "@ I avoid foods with a lot of fat and sodium @" @....@ as he was snacking on individual size bags on salted nuts and potato chips .
In the scene before that ( after his gastic bypass and much weight loss ) , the wife brought him dinner @....@ Kentucky Fried Chicken .
"@ Oh @" , she said , "@ Here 's your protein @" , as she waved an extra crispy drumstick at him .
My husband loves egg sald .
When I make it , I through out 4 out of the 12 yolks , and mix in a pound of tofu @....@ he never knows the difference .
( BTW , he 's very thin , but has a heart condition ) .
Wifey could maybe take some lessons from me .
Doctors have told me I have a full thickness rotator cuff tear and must have surgery or my shoulder will freeze .
Looking for information from anyone who has had it or with someone recuperating .
I have heard the recovery is brutally painful .
Any tips , suggestions , etc. , about what to expect during first few days , how to manage , sleep , any info .
I had it done three years ago at Johns Hopkins .
I had suffered low grade "@ bursitis @" in one shoulder for many years ( probably a worn rotator cuff ) , until one day while working out I got a real , full tear .
Lots of serious pain with some movements or any strenuous exertion .
My surgery was successful , but it took me several months to regain my range of motion in the shoulder .
I learned that the post op therapy is probably more critical than the surgery itself .
I was determined to restore the range of motion and to return to my old exercise routine , so I in effect took charge of the rehab program and made it clear to the therapist the Orthopedic Surgeon that I would n't accept less .
In retrospect I believe this was the critical thing , in that the Docs . and the therapists take their cues from the patient -- if you passively accept less than full recovery , they will let you go .
If you are determined to go on , they will help .
I have full use of the shoulder and no more pain .
I would do it again .
I hope this is helpful and wish you good luck !
I 'm under erratic , severe stress in my personal life and my colorful , efficient adrenalin glands are playing merry hell with my blood pressure .
I 'm hoping to avoid drugs by losing weight and learning serenity , but meanwhile I 'm supposed to monitor my blood pressure at home .
Once upon a time I had a jim @-@ dandy wrist unit that worked perfectly .
Then after 7 years of faithful service , it up and died .
Now the wrist units at the local drugstores come with a read @-@ outbox that is too wide for my 5 1 / 2 inch wrist .
I 've also tried the wrap @-@ the @-@ upper arm monitors .
These only work about 20 % of the time and dealing with them sends my blood pressure up to new heights .
Also , because of a lumpectomy I can only use my left arm for B.P. readings .
I 'm left handed , but am making progress in non @-@ dominent @-@ hand dexterity .
Can anyone recommend a no @-@ hassle , Luddite @-@ friendly home blood pressure monitor that will work around bird bones ?
Noddy , from your post I assume you have not checked on the models currently on the market .
Most companies have fully automatic models that do n't require adjusting it to your arm with every use .
You adjust it once to fit your arm ( You can do this with it off your arm ; it might take two tries ) and that 's that .
Slip it on your arm . Press a button and in less than a minute read your B.P. and heart rate .
I 've had an Omron for three years and have never had a problem .
I think it cost in the vicinity of $ 50 @-@ $ 60 .
You can get them a bit cheaper if you are willing to pump it up yourself .
The semi @-@ automatic that I have does the pumping for you .
As I sit here foggy headed and lets face it with most of the symptoms of hypoglycemia I thought I should do something about it .
Im trying to start to eat healthily , slowly but surely , which means cutting out processed foods and eating more natural things .
A good start to begin with but not necessarily dealing with hypoglycemia .
It says give up things like caffiene , tobacco , things I do n't consume anyway , it says give up wheat , which is bread , which I tend to eat alot of .
I assume we all do , it kind of houses all the other ingredients we need like in sandwiches or wraps , pizza .
Basically does anybody have any advice on what to eat or recomend a good book ?
Search out a glycemia index , and determine something both edible and low on the list .
Add that to your diet , to avoid getting into hypoglycemia .
If it happens anyway , skim ( non fat ) milk will raise the blood sugar about as fast as anything .
Indulge in a light bedtime snack , again , something fairly low on the list .
Do n't overdo it , though .
i have not yet been diagnosed but i am beginning to suspect hypoglycemia / low blood sugar .
lately i have been very confused , have anxiety , dizziness , fatigued , weak , depressed , and generally low .
i know i need to gain more weight - i lost about 20 pounds suddenly about 6 months ago and have n't been able to gain it back .
how does a doctor diagnose someone with this ?
what tests should i have them run ?
I have been reading about FluMist , the new flu vaccine that is administered intranasally .
One thing that I noticed , is that it is marketed as suitable for people ages 5 @-@ 49 .
I have not seen any material as to why the 50 @+ population is unsuitable for this vaccine .
Anybody know why ?
Well , according to that FDA link children between 5 and 17 are the most likely to actually get the flu itself and it looks like that was the intended target age group for the development of FluMist .
They note that it is 87 % effective in preventing people in that range from getting the flu at all but people in the 18 @-@ 49 range only had lessened symptoms .
It seems the older the patient the less effective the drug .
It is inconceivable that you take a multivitamin in good faith and it wrecks havoc on your health in such a profound way but that is the case .
I "@ was @" taking a Centrum multivitamin once a day as suggested on the back label and I was waking up with dry mouth so sever I could not even swallow .
My skin was getting scaly , my eyes burning and my feet were so dry they begin to develop calluses and crack .
I stopped my vitamin and it is now gone .
WHAT IS UP CENTRUM ?
It is not just Centrum but any type of multivitamin causes this .
If you search the internet for "@ dry mouth and multivitamin @" you get this idiot named "@ Jade M @" on Google answers that replies that it is "@ not likely @" that a multivitamin is causing this dryness of nearly every cell in the body .
Sorry to say Jade M whoever you are but you are WRONG @...
If you do n't know what you are talking about you should n't be doling out incorrect information in an online medical forum .
My sister is a nurse at a veterans hospital and she complained to her doctor that she was getting dry mouth .
He told her that it was her multivitamin and she cut down her intake of the multivitamin and her dry mouth left completely .
A friend of mine who takes many medications for his heart just came up to me and told me he was getting terrible dry mouth at night and reduced his multivitamin to only a few times a week and now no more dry mouth .
In other words if you follow the directions on the back label of your vitamins they will start slowly killing you .
Do n't expect Paul G. Donohue M.D.to help you either .
He basically dismisses this elderly persons claim then tries to get her to take corrective medications .
How typical @...
I get dry mouth too plus my skin gets dry and scaly and when I stop my multivitamin it immediately goes away .
Now this is four completely unrelated people all coming to the exact same conclusion .
Not only can we not trust the general consensus on the internet but we can not trust people who have PHD credentials giving their advice online .
What do we have to dry up and die before we finally figure out what ails us ?
When my sister told this to me I did not really give it much thought .
Then I permanently lost 10 % of my eyesight due to dry eyes .
Then my mouth chronically became dry , skin kept piling up on my feet that I could n't sand it off fast enough to keep up with it , the skin on my hands became scaly and my lips kept cracking and my tongue felt like it had pins and needles poking into it .
I stop the multivitamin and my mouth symptoms are gone , sadly my eyesight is still damaged .
I should have just listened to my sister rather than err , Jade M .
My doctor was even prescribing fish oil supplements to correct the dry skin problem which could not even put a dent in the problems being caused by my multivitamin .
I do n't consume a lot of salt in my diet and I am on no other medications or drugs whatsoever .
If you are experiencing dry mouth and take a multivitamin stop the vitamin immediately before you ruin your health irreversibly .
Take it only a few times a week , if that , and you will realize the vitamins cause this .
I was also told by a pharmacist that other than the antioxidants , a person gets what they need from their diet of most minerals and do not require a multivitamin at all .
So a strictly antioxidant formula is all that is required minus the multivitamin minerals .
Please weigh in on this , sorry I am upset about this but I am also troubled now by internet advice that is clearly WRONG about this issue and no telling how many others .
Tinnitus , vision loss , global cellular degeneration , moisture loss , and even constipation are all caused by general use of multivitamins .
Also if you are feeding your children multivitamins you should be highly cautious of this too .
Even children should only be given a multivitamin a few times a week and not every day .
They should be explained the dangers of regular use of vitamins ( in other words following the prescribed dosage ) .
Take it from me who has experienced this first hand , my sister who is a nurse , my friend taking many meds whose dry mouth stopped the very day he cut down on his multivitamin and L.F who was incorrectly advised by , err , Donehue .
It is a sad commentary that people have to collectively learn this on their own and that doctors , health specialists and the internet are so out of the loop .
Consider that vitamin waters and health food drinks on top of a multivitamin only compound this problem .
I forget what my sister said was causing this , I seem to recall zinc , but I may be wrong about that .
I have to ask her again .
Consider if it is visibly destroying your skin it is also destroying your major organs too .
Please comment and offer any further advice on this subject .
I just started on a new kind of multivitamin and my body 's been all kinds of crazy .
I used to just take specific vitamins but that got expensive and elaborate and I was missing some things so I switched to a multi .
The multi has calcium and I know from previous experience that calcium tears my stomach up .
I 'm getting older and I know that I need some calcium though .
I do n't have dry mouth but I agree that multivitamins can have unintended consequences .
I have been taking high potency multivitamins for almost twenty years .
I have not know any side effects .
One thing , though is to not have certain foods too close to the time of the taking , because certain ones can interact .
For instance , I am taking something now that advises to not take regular vitamin C for an hour on either side of taking that product .
It suggests discontinuing the 12 hour release of Vitamin C for as long as that product is being used .
I have to constantly make such comparisons to make sure it all works .
I am on very high dose vitamin C , besides my green multiple , that is very concentrated compared top wimpy Centrum .
I never had dry mouth until this high dose of C , so I am assuming it is the C .
I use it as an antihistamine to control my IBS .
I have overactive mast cells that start pulling water into my gut when i run out of C and Magnesium ( this I think was caused by taking a round of vaccines in 2003 , and the studies I found online confirm that mercury in the adjuvants often do cause increased histamine production ) .
So I am on 4000 @-@ 6000 mg of C 4 X daily and 400 @-@ 600 mg Magnesium 4 x Daily .
This is a lot , but I have learned it does control my bowels .
The normal person would get colon blow from these doses , and it firms me up to normal .
This is ultimately an adrenal issue , as the adrenals are throwing out huge amounts of electrolytes and I am sure other stuff , so until I realized this I was in constant loose bowels losing my nutrients .
But it HAS caused dry mouth .
I do n't think it is as bad as some I have read here .
There are some archaelogists who believe that two sites in Syria could be the world 's earliest cities .
Tell Brak and Tell Hamoukar in the NE of Syria may have existed back in 3700 BC .
Seems plausible .
Damascus is generally considered to be the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world .
It 's mentioned by name in Genesis as a place where Abraham stopped on his way to Canaan from Ur of the Chaldees ( in modern-day Iraq ) .
According to this , American citizens can now be arrested and detained indefinitely without trial .
Does that mean that anyone can be taken and put into a hole forever without justification ?
If so , I think it 's scary .
But who decides that the person was actually a member of or working for Al Qaeda ?
What court can review that decision ?
Well , the verdict just came in .
Guilty of involuntary manslaughter .
The judge would not let him be released until sentencing either .
The judge said his behavior was wreckless and the community could be in harm 's way . ( Not his exact words ) .
I am glad he is losing his license .
No matter what , he never should have given Michael Jackson that propofol .
The man practiced here for many years .
The local TV news is running nothing but outrage over the conviction .
Not one word in favor of it .
The local ABC channel featured a legal expert who derided the trial , calling it a travesty , making doctors afraid to treat patients and so forth .
He seems to think a "@ proper @" court would have let Murray go free .
An increasing proportion of US children are so severely obese as to be at immediate risk for life @-@ threatening complications including type 2 diabetes .
Some will become candidates for treatment at newly established pediatric surgical weight loss programs throughout the country .
As an alternative approach , involvement of state protective services might be considered , including placement into foster care in carefully selected situations .
Ultimately , government can reduce the need for such interventions through investments in the social infrastructure and policies to improve diet and promote physical activity among children .
Severe obesity in children -- is that a form of child abuse ?
Should the state step in and save these kids from their parents ?
David @... you 're so not looking at the big picture .
If this current trend continues , a whole generation or two will be lost .
Considering that we are globally competing against India and China who so far DO N'T suffer this epidemic , we will fall farther behind in almost every aspect .
These next generations will become a major burden on our health care system .
Prevention is needed now not later when it will most likely NOT work .
Cheaper to fix it now then to let it cripple the entire economy at a later date .
I live in CA and I signed an affiliation agreement 12 / 09 which states that I was to pay a monthly fee to the owners .
The owners said "@ NOT @" to pay until my business had picked up .
Although my business is struggling , I have tried several times to start paying this fee .
Each time the owners said "@ NO @" do n't worry about .
We have now parted ways , for both personal and professional reasons , and now they are taking me to small claims court for the affiliation fee they said I did n't have to pay plus their legal fees ( I am being bullied ) .
Has anyone dealt with a situation like this ?
I thought a verbal agreement would override a written agreement , but is that hard to prove ?
I mean obviously the proof is that they are suing me for back fees that I have not been paying because business has been slow .
Please , help or share your story .
It sounds like there is more than what you have posted .
Did you break a lease or agreement with them ?
Leave early ?
It sounds like they were waiving certain fees , with the understanding that you were going to stay for the long haul .
If you left early , then they now want all their fees .
A written agreement trumps a verbal agreement .
A written agreement is hard proof .
Without that it 's your word against their word .
You should have put the money is escrow if you felt uncomfortable with the arrangement .
My newspaper has an article today on animal hoarders , listing some signifigant recent cases @:
One woman lived on an old school bus with 117 dogs , 4 cats and 2 chickens .
One man had 500 dogs .
Another had 80 cats .
Two weeks ago , animal services confiscated 39 cats living with a man in a van .
Most hoarders live in unimaginable filth .
( I did n't want to post the photos because they are really gross . )
Most of these people are charged with animal abuse and neglect and they are fined and jailed .
Do you think these people are criminals ?
i watched animal planet ( way too late at night this weekend ) and saw a florida animal cops .
They busted a hoarder with 82 dogs and confiscated 78 of them ( i think legally in fla you can have 4 ) .
The dogs were in such bad shape , some could n't walk because their nails were so long , most were flea infested and had been sleeping in their own feces .
there were two sets of puppies in the house and as they panned around the house , it appeared that there were at least two other sets of puppies in the making .
the woman was not prosecuted as long as she was willing to give up the amount needed to take her back to the legal limit .
and they checked up on her after that .
apparently the media ran a story about it and over 40 dogs were adopted the first day they were available .
i go for mentally ill as well , but like freeduck said , sometimes the only way to get them treatment is to prosecute .
They just told this woman they would keep checking up on her ( randomly so she could n't hide pets like she was when they were rounding them up ) and as long as she had only 4 , she was fine .
that seems reasonable to me since no dogs were dead , no dogs were starving , they just needed more attention .
it was a much better story than the dog chained to a tree for 3 weeks in florida heat that finally succumbed @...@ made me cry .
now those people should be tied to a tree with no food and water and see how they do @...
We had our own local "@ cat lady @" who made the newspaper headlines a couple of decades ago .
She lived in a filthy , almost uninhabitable house surrounded by cats , cats , cats .
Many people tried to help her , but she made it impossible for anyone to give her effective assistance even in the face of having her home condemned .
And that 's what eventually happened .
Her house was declared a public nuisance and the city tore it down .
I 'm pretty sure this old lady had more than just a few screws loose .
I saw her many years ago at a local supermarket .
She was wearing a drab winter coat and a large colorful scarf around her head with her unkempt gray wig hairs sticking out .
She was slumped against a wall and the store personnel had called an ambulance .
It was a pathetic sight .
I think it is a kind of depression myself , where one lets go of a lot of effort to keep up with daily life except to '@ care @' for animals , and then is overwhelmed but sees no way out of it - except that they do , I gather , start again .
A kind of compulsion .
Not that I do n't want them stopped .
Is this a kind of ocd ? a pre @-@ alzheimers ?
There is something to be said for humane institutional care , and I am not talking about the dogs .
Tricky subject , on which I can see several sides .
Please - this is NOT a thread about the case , as such , I find those threads concerning - BUT about some of the differences between the American , and some other countries @' practices - and their effect .
For instance @: i ) In Australia , and , I believe , Great Britain at the very least , the name of a juvenile involved in a criminal matter is not revealed , whether they be alleged victim , or alleged perpetrator , except in very special circumstances
( eg they have been kidnapped , and police seek public help to find them - or they have been murdered - or if they are alleged to have committed a very serious crime and are being tried as adults , or if it is in some way in the public interest . )
To these non @-@ US eyes , it is very shocking to see the name and photograph of the young man alleged to have been abused by Jackson splashed all over the media -
here , juveniles are protected to the point that , on the few occasions I have accompanied a minor who was raped or sexually abused to court , while she / he gave testimony - if the offender ( these were cases where , oddly , a conviction was obtained , so I do not say "@ alleged @" offender ) was also a minor , it was a big deal to be allowed in to be a support person for the victim , because I would hear the name of the offender .
What do people think of the US practice ?
What is the reason for it ?
Which would you prefer ?
What do you think is the impact on young people so identified ?
ii ) The media circus .
Here , both defence and prosecution are very limited as to what they can say about a case that is before the courts . The matter is considered sub judice .
Occasionally , with high profile cases , the police will "@ leak @" things - and / or the media will attempt , within the letter of the law , to try a case in the media ( the Lindy Chamberlain case was a terrible example of both these occurrences ) -
but the organised propaganda campaigns that I think I detect in the US are not generally present .
Full details are generally releasable only after the trial .
Again , the spectacle is very shocking to these non @-@ US eyes .
I presume it is allowed because of an interpretation of free speech ?
Do people think it aids justice ? That it is societally positive ? What do you think ?
iii ) This is unrelated - but , do people think this is going to be another black v white case , and do you think that high profile non @-@ Caucasian people still - despite their wealth and power - are unfairly treated in the US justice system ?
I would think that , similarly to here , that poorer and obscure people of colour would tend to be - but I am interested in views re people who have achievedfame and fortune .
Judging the US legal system based on what goes on in , say , the Jackson case is probably a bad idea .
I 've served on jury duty several times and came away highly impressed with how seriously everybody took their various responsibilities .
A case like Jackson 's , alas , or the Kobe Bryant case betray many standards .
The media have some role in this , as do glory @-@ hounding attorneys on both sides .
I 'm sure , for example , that a minor 's name should never be publicized in a case like this .
I 'm trying to pay as little attention to this case as possible , because I think it 's more a freak show than anything else .
Please do n't judge our system on the basis of the Jackson trial !
We have very strict publication bans around identity of abused minors in Canada .
The person charged often can not be identified , as their name , and the details of the relationship to the child , would mean the child could possibly be identified .
Sleeping next to the elephant means we 've probably become a bit jaded to the circus . But the laws are much tighter here .
I would be extraordinarily happy not to make such a judgment , D'Artagnan !!!! But - it is ALLOWED to happen !
Would the name of the child , for instance , normally be suppressed ?
How often do cases become media circuses ?
I guess what I am getting at is the different LAWS on such matters @...
Interesting to have such differences in the systems of countries that grew so similarly , ehBeth .
We seem much more like you guys - but , I suppose , the US invented its laws after a revolution - we inherited them after centuries of slow evolution with no cataclysm , and made changes slowly .
I think but I 'm not completely sure if you can print any name of a sexual abuse victim in Canada without the express permission of the victim .
You can not print the name of any minor whether the victim or perpetrator of any crime , except in very special / rare circumstances where a minor is at large and a suspected danger to the community or themselves .
A court order is needed in these cases and once the minor is apprehended the name and or picture must not be printed again , ever .
News outlets are rarely allowed to print anything specific in these cases as well .
In cases of family abuse the names are rarely printed , if ever , in order to protect the victim .
I had no idea the victim in the Jackson cases was publicized .
I have seen pictures of his previous victim which I though was pretty appalling but generally the faces have been smudged out .
What I hope will happen here is that people will come along to present the case FOR allowing the names to be made public , because it is incomprehensible to me -
but there MUST be reasons for the US system to be the way it is on these matters .
It is n't as though people in the US are not interested in and critical of their own system - gotta be a reason @...
I think they are getting ready to bring the first miner up .
Over 2,000 feet up , in a little tube , through a little tunnel .
On CNN I saw a picture they showed of the faces of the miners , and I saw at least a couple guys that look way too big to fit in that thing .
I guess they 'll be sucking in their guts .
Wow , 69 days .
That 's like a full season of Big Brother .
I guess the whole rescue is supposed to take about two days , if their estimates are correct and nothing goes wrong .
And the whole thing will be watched live all over the world .
Here 's a place where there are some livestreams if you want to check it out .
Americans could learn a lot from the Chilean people as the 33 miners are rescued .
They came together to support and save the miners @' lives .
So much better than the political party fighting going on over the coming elections in the U.S.
I have a question .
The last man , one of the rescuers , must be able to lock the rescue tube 's door correctly from the inside ?
I can understand how he could hook up the oxygen pack and other devises , but I can n't figure out how he can lock the door so it does n't come loose if no one is there to do it from the outside .
he will have to hold it shut with a handle or maybe a bungee cord held on the inside .
Good question .
Looks like these guys are gonna get out in time to do their Christmas Shopping
I am sorry ; but I thought Chili was part of America @...
One of them at least @...
They come in two 's you know @...@ Inner Mongolia , and outer Mongolia @...@ That sort of thing @...
In any event , I do not know the answer to your question @...

I 'm watching on the telly yet another shooter ( Orlando Fla ) news says 8 victims taken to hospital .
You know what David is going to tell you in a few minutes @: if the others had guns to protect themselves , they all would be dead by now .
That 's how gun logic works , my dear dys .
Guess all the gun crazy psychotics are flipping out of the woodwork .
yeah , and then I 'm a gun owner .
And your """"@ enlightened @"""" solution is ?
my "@ enlightened @" solution is for everyone to determine who might become a potential shooter and kill them before they are able to harm anyone .
Does my sarcasm equate adequately to yours ?
I 'm talking specifically about the showing of the contents of the package that he sent to NBC .
I realize that this stuff will probably come out anyway , and that the public really REALLY wants to see what was in that package , but is n't it also in a way glorifying / validating the guy 's actions and giving him exactly what he wanted ?
For instance , the image of him pointing a gun at the camera is on just about every news site I see online , and the video clips of his rantings are starting to show up everywhere as well . And his writing .
I realize how fascinating it is to try to get inside this nutball 's head , but is there any way to put the news out there about him without giving him rock star status ?
Is it even possible ?
I wonder how long until this stuff shows up on murderauction.com or one of those other disgusting sites .
I think there can be details ( what happened when , who tried to do what , etc. ) without spreading his own propaganda . Because that 's what it is .
He stage @-@ managed this -- he wanted the badass stuff out there , he wanted that lasting image .
Just show a small picture of who he was , the original one was fine .
The rest is unnecessary , and articles BBB and nimh have linked to argue convincingly that the propaganda is downright dangerous .
The American public has reached the point in our culture , that the news that gets the most coverage is the news that plays to the lowest common denominator amongst us .
Think about it . For weeks , there was Pamela Anderson and the baby . Then it was Don Imus . Now all we hear about is that murderous nutjob who acted on his sickest delusions .
It is like the newspapers and TV want to beat out the supermarket rags . Ugh !
I 've been enjoying the NYTimes blog , primarily by Michael Kimmelman , who I 'm used to reading when he writes about art .
But he 's joined by several other good writers who are apparently hanging around the US Open typing away as they feel like it .
I like all the different viewpoints .
Have always like Vecsey 's writing , but can n't read him in the paper lately because he 's now in the Times Select group that you have to pay for to get access to , even on the day of the article .
My favorite writer on the blog is Kimmelman , he seems to have my eyes , if I had his .
I 'm enjoying the play by play , as it were , so much that I want to see if I can go back and read the blog on the World Cup .
Probably not , as so much time has passed .
Anybody on a2k following this ?
Going to the matches ?
I do follow international tennis -- one of the first things I want to glance over on the morning newspaper .
Not going to the matches , though ?
Well , so are you following the US open ( http://www.usopen.org/ ) ?
Who are your fave players ?
Yeah , she sure was a tennis prodigy .
She 's always lacked the killer serve that is a key to today 's power game , though .
If she did n't have it in her heyday , she 's not going to have it now in the twilight of her career .
Hey , hope your day is going well !
I have a question for anyone who feels that want to answer .
I have been watching a bit of '@ Rhythmic Gymnastics @' on YouTube @...@ I just find it amazing @...@ it 's very cool .
I do n't have children , but when I get to that stage , I 'd love a daughter of mine to take part in this really cool sport .
My question though is , is it true or just a myth that while all this crazy flexibility at a young age is nice , at old age they will be in pain and not able to move at all ?
If it is true , I 'd prefer not to have any part in it , but if it 's not true , it would be great to know .
Can anyone help ?
I 'm no expert , but Nadia Comenechi , the famous Romanian gymnast , has no health problems from her gymnastics days though her former gymnast husband is wracked with arthritis .
Thanks for you quick reply .
Could it be that different people react to it in different ways ?
Maybe you just enjoy it while you do , and if you find it painful afterwards @...@ bad luck , if not @...@ GREAT !
Has anyone else got any other thoughts ?
I 'm not familiar with rhythmic gymnastics , but I know both gymnasts and dancers are prone to on @-@ the @-@ job injury -- and the effects of those injuries can add up .
The behaviour of Australian cricket fans is of more concern than the thousands of spirited Barmy Army members set to descend upon our shores for this summer 's Ashes series , say Victoria 's police .
The number of English fans travelling to Australia is expected to easily surpass the 10,000 who came for the 2002 @-@ 03 Ashes series because of last year 's victory and because of an online ticketing fiasco that saw thousands of English fans nabbing Ashes tickets meant for Australians .
There has been some discussion here about the Ashes .
Not the test series , the actual ones .
Apparently the Aussies ( a devious lot ) have said that when they win the series ( that 's IF they do , but they do n't think that way ) they want to take the small urn from its permanent place at Lord 's Cricket Ground back to Oz .
MCC say , on your bikes Cobber , because that urn is a gift , not a trophy , and it stays where it is .
What say the Aussies now ?
I 'm sitting here pulling my hair out because my roomate is watching the Masters on TV . I 'd rather drink battery acid than watch golf .
While semi @-@ watching , I just realized something @: while the golfer is setting up his shot , and about to swing , all the fans get very quiet for them . Then I thought about fans at sports games ( golf is n't a sporting event , it 's a hobby ) , and they scream , yell , and do their best to annoy the opposing team 's players and throw them off their game .
Why the hell do golfers escape that aspect ? The pressure and ability to block stuff out adds to the challenge . Why are they so special ?
This made me just hate watching golf on TV even more .
I love golfing .
Do n't understand watching it .
Also do n't understand courses that use carts .
None of that new @-@ fangled crap for me .
Walk , and carry your bloody clubs .
so there are others out there other than myself that hate golf and believe its not a sport ? thats wonderful !
golf is a sport @... an incredibly boring sport @...
tennis players get the same '@ silent treatment @' from spectators -- not exactly sure why @...
Bite me , Slappy .
Hatred of golf is for people with brain deficiencies .
One other thing that must annoy you . In all other sports ( yeah , golf is a sport ) @...@ there are refs and umps and all that . And the people playing the sports argue with those officials all the time .
In golf @...@ you gotta call fouls on yourself . And golfers do !
There ai n't nothing in the world better than golf . ( Well @...@ maybe one thing . But even that , you can eventually get enough of . You can never get enough of golf . )
Will Tom ever return to the Pats ?
Ever ? Yeah , next season .
It 's looking like he is out for the year , though depedning on his rehabilitation , he may try to be available for the playoffs .
It 's tough to say though .
My money is on Brady to return next year .
I do n't think he 's willing to let the previous season 's Super Bowl be his last .
Or it is possible you will stand there with a frozen grin on your face , unable to say anything remotely intelligent .
WE CAN HELP YOU !
Several of us A2K @'@ ers have created a support group to painlessly guide you towards appearing knowledgeable even if , like many of us , you are clueless .
They are called the Wildcard games .
You will need to invest a grand total of 7 minutes . Total . Max .
Please indicate , by noon on Saturday , Jan 8 th , your picks on these 4 games @:
NY Jets @ Indianapolis Colts
Baltimore Ravens @ Kansas City Chiefs
New Orleans Saints @ Seattle Seahawks
Green Bay Packers @ Philadelphia Eagles
The Jets aggravated me no end in Fantasy Football ( Sanchez was my quarterback ) , so this seems to me a perfectly good reason to pick the Colts , who also aggravated me , but not as much .
I 'm placing my faith that the Jet 's defense will kick in one more time .
Plus I like it that no one else seems to have faith in the Jets .
Besides this wild card round is just fodder for the real games when the Patriots start playing and ultimately take the whole burrito , ( enchiladas are n't classy enough for Tom Brady and the gang ) .
Instead of a coin toss - and because I know absolutely nothing about football @- I 'm going to do it by which city I know / like better and see how well I do .
So my picks will be @:
New York
Baltimore
New Orleans
Philadelphia
Just as an experiment to begin with , but I am fairly competititive in spirit , so if one of my teams makes it to the Super Bowl - I 'll watch it instead of the Andy Griffith show marathon and eat me some chicken wings and drink a beer or two .
Sounds fun to me @...@ can n't hurt .
Is there a prize ?
in an article in toronto 's "@ globe and mail @" newspaper , John Polanyi , a Nobel laureate and member of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Toronto , recommends that afghanistan farmers be allowed ( you might even say "@ be encouraged @" ) to grow poppies ( opium ) legally .
he argues that there is a shortage of painkilling medication , particularly in poor , third world countries , and that afghanistan could supply the needed poppies at a lower price than commercially produced painkillers .
i saw the interview he gave on CBC-TV recently and he seems to know what he is talking about .
as he put it : "@ the afghan farmer has to make a living to feed his - often large - family .
we can force him to produce the poppies illegally and feed into the illegal drug market or we can buy the poppies from him and help provide pain @-@ killing drugs . @"
as i posted sometime ago , countries such as :france , australia and india are permitted to grow poppies legally for the production of drugs - why not allow the afghan farmers the same privilege ?
have a look at the article and see if you agree with him or not .
The problem with poppy cultivation is n't the growing of the crop itself .
The problem is oversight and marketing .
Opiates have legitimate medicinal uses .
Unfortunately , the product of the papver somniferum plant has far more monetary value on the black market than when sold to legitimate pharmaceutical manufacturers .
Thanks for the article and the background - I read both .
There would be problems though .
The criminal element that currently buy the crop are still going to try and get their hands on it , so the crops would need to be guarded .
That 's going to cost a fair bit and probably result in bloodshed .
Hottest world conflicts in the computer near you ! Live ! Entertaining ! Wild !
The future of the news reality shows , or whatever should one call it .
Kevin Sites touring the world 's conflict zones with digital technology that will allow him to blog and transmit images and videos from war ridden areas daily .
One can contact him there , or chat with him live on the website .
Now while I know he 's doing it voluntarily and probably for a shootload of money , I have to say I find the idea of such a project odd and somewhat disconcerning .
Will it start a new wave of journalists seeking out the most dangerous situations to sell their goods ?
Competition on who can go the farthest ?
And will that encourage the sides in conflict to up their performance , so to speak , getting international live coverage straight from the front ?
Especially if there will be more and more Keven Sites'es roaming the world ?
Thousands of journalists already do seek out war zones , sure .
But this is taking it to a whole new level , I think .
Anyway , I 'm confused about how I feel about it .
I will surely look in often to see where he 's at and will be curious about the reports and live videos .
It has a voyeuristic element to it , does n't it ?
Ah , what is this world coming to .
And what does the future of journalism hold for us ?
Can we control it in any way ?
What do you think ?
gus , that 's what 's making me uncomfortable .
it just seems like a stoopid idea to me .
but i will n't deny that i am also curious , although it makes me feel kinda dirty .
partaking in making a violent conflict a part of entertainment culture .
well , more so than it already is . yecchh .
Everything in life has a positive , and a negative side .
The good thing about this is that they might be able to record what really is happening in certain areas of the world in case the governments of the world tell us different .
If they make money good for them !
If they survive many of these men come back home changed , and sometimes not for the better .
They could also come back wounded or sick .
To me , it 's a good thing to be able to choose how your going to die when it 's for a good cause .
There are incidents where the bastards in charge decide it would be best for a certain reporter to "@ die in conflict @"
Mr. Sites better tread carefully .
Of course , I imagine he 'll have quite an entourage and that might ensure his safety from the more devious sorts .
The UN or at least some of the members threaten sanctions .
Sanctions , what sanctions could the UN impose , refuse to purchase the lifeblood of industry @"@ OIL @" ?
Iraq could on the other hand cut their production and cause the price of that commodity to go through the roof .
Is the threat of sanctions just another instance where the US and the UN is just blowing smoke ?
It 's blowing smoke as it 's the people who will end up suffering from any such move .
If the UN really wants to make a difference , they could threaten to pass a resolution !!!!!
Ooooooh ! That ought to scare 'em @....@ @"
And Bush is clamering the loudest .
Does he , I wonder , think that would be his excuse to invade .
It would be WMD 's all over again .
I can n't believe that even the crew that "@ owns @" the US at the present time would do something as rash and ill conceived .
Let me start by saying that I love Morocco .
I 've been there a few times in the last 6 or 7 years and have become familiar with its people and customs and geography and unique challenges .
Each time I 've visited , I 've noticed immense , fast @-@ paced progress , both economically and socially .
Since my first visit there a network of well @-@ built highways has been built , enabling european and internal tourism and commerce to flourish .
I 've witnessed cell phones come on the market and virtually explode .
High speed internet is available .
House building and land development is through the roof .
Agricultural technology has taken off and enabled farmers to be profitable and efficient , as well as increasing the availability of affordable food to all Moroccans .
My aim for this thread is to periodically discuss new developments and economic initiatives in Morocco as they come about in the news , as well as any other news that is deemed curious or interesting .
I 'm interested in Morocco .
I know there are some cells there of folks who want to cause havoc but that is presumably not the whole population .
The country has seemed attractive to me for years .
At the least , I am interested in hearing more about it .
Don , could you be more specific about why Morocco is to be avoided ?
This all reminds me of myself sitting at a train station in italy at about 5 @:@ 30 a.m. one morning .
My husband and I wandered in after buying our train tickets to get cappuccini and dolci before the ride @... and shared a table with two tourists from the US .
On my right was a table of what turned out to be moroccan laborers .
My xhub and the tourers were talking away about something and I glanced over at the ( moroccans ) and we started talking in poor italian , which is how I found out they were from Morocco .
Very polite sleepy early morning nice conversation @.. I turned to the others and the lady said , "@ dear , you musn't talk with them , they are dangerous . @"
I can n't remember what I said , but it was short , succinct .
That was a long time ago .
Not every immigrant from far away lands is the devil in disguise , and neither are all of us .
Well said , JLN !
I have n't been there myself but my 3 sons and a friend went a couple of years ago .
They said a ) it was one of the most beautiful places they had been and b ) it was the place in the world they had been most hassled and cheated .
I think , too , that as 4 young men travelling together , they were looked upon as a challenge by local youth .
They said there was fighting amongst kids in the street and this seemed to be normal and tolerated .
So it is a society with a very male testosterone @-@ rich style .
The shops run by women were altogether less hassly , more friendly .
One thing they found particularly hard to deal with was other young men attaching themselves to their group and being undislodgeable ( a nwe word and it 's only 9 am ! ) .
My eldest who is especially friendly and tolerant tried to make friends with these people but in the end they all wanted something .
That can be dispiriting for the open @-@ minded and open @-@ hearted .
But they enjoyed their stay generally , would certainly not avoid it in future .
As for lumping all Islamic countries together as a no go area - what complete nonsense !
As we 're going to Turkey and Syria at the end of this month , and expect to have a wonderful trip as independent travellers , I am definitely making a political statement -
I do NOT lump all Muslims together , and believe that 98 % are friendly to travellers .
Most are undoubtedly anti @-@ American and anti @-@ Bush , but that is not a sentiment confined to the Islamists .
My engagement ring / wedding ring and other personal ring along with my husband 's wedding ring was stolen .
At least we assume so .
We went camping and put them together in the car .
After camping and coming home we searched high and low and could not find them .
We called the campgrounds and the owners said they had cleaned our campsite and did not find anything .
So we had to assume some one stole them .
We did have the car unlocked at times so it is a definate possibility .
Really stinks at it was just our anniversary right before .
Yep , that stinks .
We were robbed one time right before Christmas .
Came home , and the basement door had been kicked in .
All they took were wrapped Christmas gifts , and all of my husband 's socks .
Sounds funny now , but at the time I felt very violated at the thought of strangers going through my house .
@mags314772 ,
Yes I can say the one thing was at least it was n't in my house .
The idea of some one going through your house is as bad as them taking Christmas presents .
Wow , the Afghanis are in for a life @-@ changing shock to their culture and way of life .
Tribal leaders , international corporations , international governments and bordering neighbors will all be vying with each other and the Afghani people for a piece of the action .
It will be interesting to watch who takes what sides .
Will China and Russia now side with the Taliban to take over the country and exploit the riches ?
Will the US help the Afghani people to learn from our mistakes and protect their natural environment from strip mining ?
Will Al Queda now return to the country to enrich themselves with the profits ?
Will the lithium deposits take away from efforts by Al Gore and others to invest in and invent research and development in improved battery storage for the very young renewable clean energy industry in the U.S. ?
I do n't think that any vast deposits found in one land that barely exists as a state and has almost no industry will be a setup for a despotic regime or a surge of TAliban takeover of provinces within which are these deposits .
SInce much of it lies in the mountainous regions of the West and southwest , these are already the subject of the new campaign against a resurfacing TAliban .
These minerals , especially the Lithium , will need major processing before its in a commercial state for batteries .
Long term development for all kinds of batteries for entire new gizmos ( not just blackberries ) will be based on better and better lithium cells .
Most of the worlds recoverable deposits lie in south America lake deposits and in our own western North Carolina in vast quartz deposits .
If they found deposits of rhodium and platinum itd be a major reason to enter negotiations to help em develop their resources .
You can have all the rear metals in the world in your country , but the supporting infrastructer 's must be in place , I.E. roads , power plants , process facilties , WATER , tons and tons of WATER , chemical suppliers , etc.
So what may appear as a rich mineral bonanza , will be shot down for now and the forseable future , because the cost of extraction , is larger that any profit margin .
The Administrative and Legislative branches of our government can n't agree on how to make a dent in our deficits .
The solution ?
Go on vacation for a month and appoint a bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives to try to work out some sort of plan .
Their mission is to reduce next year 's deficit by $ 1.2 Tn over the next 10 years .
They must come up with a plan by Thanksgiving - roughly 100 days - that 7 of the 12 members can agree on .
If they fail , there will be across the board cuts .
If they succeed , their plan must pass the House and the Senate with no alterations .
I , too , am skeptical , edgar .
The 3 Dems and 3 Repubs from the House seem to be intractably committed to their parties @' more extreme wings .
The Senators are being described as "@ dealmakers , @" willing to compromise at the end .
We will have to see .
In the meantime , if any of you find biographies of the 12 members of the super committee , please link or write your own profile of them .
I 've said elsewhere that I do n't think they 're expected to accomplish anything .
They may put out a proposal but it will probably fail in one chamber or the other .
Neither chamber can come to consensus on substantive reforms , imo , and the triggers will be pulled .
The triggers were specifically chosen because each one is desirable to one party and not anethema to the other .
It never was a good idea and only seemed to be a good idea to the morons .
There was never any reason to think that this was going to work , and now that it will not they are going to try to defuse the trigger @...@ but THAT might not work either .
I do n't know what the Vegas odds of gutting the defense department is but I put it at around 30 % .
It was always going to happen at some point , but maybe 10 @-@ 20 years down the line , not now .
If this happens it will be a major breaking of faith with the American people .
Millions of Americans went to war for America , and came back broken or otherwise gave up a lot , and now we look to take a huge chunk of their hide because Washington no longer works .
This , folks , is going to be a problem .
EDIT @: "@ delay and pray @" has not worked in Europe , and it will not work in America .
In both places we see from our so called leaders a massive refusal to step up to the plate .
Bullshit !!! we are our own people .
The reason we are fighting the worlds wars is because the very rich who do n't want to pay their share of taxes want the protection of the government for the wealth and jobs they have imported to other countries .
What the majority of the U.S. citizens get in return is nothing but a lack of jobs and a reduction in our ability to feed our families .
Time to plug yourself in for a recharge , youre starting to run down .
If you wanna defeat Obama , seems to me you need a candidate with something between their ears .
All I see is Bozo and friends on the GOP side .
( Hint @: Id vote for a republican if one of substance showed up , Im not too thrilled with the job Obama did .
I think he wasted his capital on the health care right at the beginning of the worst economic situation weve seen in our lifetimes .
UNFORTUNATELY , you can not really think that any of the present gaggle of GOP candidates have got substance ) .
Thus the analysis that I have put up on A2K in multiple places that the US Federal Government is corrupt , and is run by the corporate class .
We see the oppression of the people by the government in other areas besides economics though , for instance I have pointed out how this oppression is woven onto our sex law .
The oppressors should not get too comfy , as oppressors the world over are finding out they get over thrown by force of public will .
The oppressors of the American people will eventually suffer the same fate @...
Where is Theodore "@ Teddy @" Roosevelt when we need him --- again ?
The greatest irony I 've seen here at a2k Hawkeye is although I agree with on the statement that the US is an oligarchy or a plutocracy I believe you have foolishly drunk the Kool @-@ Aid to think the Tea Party is genuine in it 's pursuit to save the country from "@ our oppressors @" when EVERY move they propose is a basic tenet to strengthen the status quo .
Clearly you are too blinded by your personal selfishness and greed to see and feel the rain falling on your head from your Tea Party overlords .
Governments exist for a reason .
Progressive governments exist and should continue to exist in order to protect it 's citizens from the raiding and looting hordes of the multibillion dollar conglomerates and banking institutions who themselves exist in order to set up a select small population into extreme wealth and power .
I am not of the Tea Party , I am a radical leftist formerly a revolutionary currently a socialist .
It could be argued that a better word is collectivist @...
I strongly support libertarian political actions because I want to see individuals once again free enough from government oppresion that they can choose to come together in collective effort .
What we have now is a sham socialism impossed by a government which is owned by the coporate class , whos only mission is to grab more wealth .
We are free from government oppression .
Now if we can free ourselves from our billion dollar overlords perhaps we can enjoy real freedom and get rid of our bought politicians .
The Euro countries are afraid to let Greece go bankrupt , because it will be followed by Spain and Ireland .
If that happens , the Euro 's value will drop to unimaginable levels , and inflation will hit all their countries .
The European Central Banks Euro policies continue to exacerbate the problems for Greece and the other Euro countries with huge deficits .
France and Germany are trying their best to prop up Greece with more loans and forgiving of loans , but that seems like a losing proposition when Greece really does n't have an economy that can pay back the loans they already have .
It seems like desperation times for the Euro zone countries , but the majority are in no position to assist Greece with their growing deficit .
How long will this plugging of holes in the dam last ?
Germany and France are in no position to save all of them when the water 's rush gets stronger by the month ( growing deficits ) .
Greece 's debt is 179 % of GDP .
How will they survive ?
I believe we 're on the rim of an economic maelstrom .
Greece is only the latest symptom of a financial disease that has become pandemic .
I believe that , too .
Rather like an individual who works hard , produces useful work , and saves for the future suddenly finding himself wiped out because of the acts of a central bank , somewhere .
You guys are depressing me .
Can n't I just go back to blissful ignorance ?
After WWII , the recovery was fast .
There was pent up demand for everything after the war , because most civilians earned money building our war machines for four years , and there was hardly any consumer goods to buy .
Even food was put on rations .
What was "@ funny @" to some degree was the "@ cheap @" junk we imported from Japan , because Americans were ready to spend money .
I remember lighters from Japan were made from soda pop cans , and they must have sold millions of those .
It appears a global recession is on its way .
A bush league president and political party should never be near the steering wheel of the US economy .
Their reckless policies and ideology can only lead backwards to a 18 th or 19 th century society of robber barons and ideological cutthroats .
It 's too late ; we 've been a recession many months ago ; most families could not continue to live their lifestyles of a couple of years ago because food and fuel costs have increased to the point most could not keep up with those higher costs .
As family members lost their jobs and homes , many also lost their health insurance .
That 's a biggie for most families .
You can listen to our government about "@ not being in a recession , @" but I see it different .
Some important cricket is going to be played out in the next coupla months @:
Australia takes on SL ( or rather Australian spectators take on Murali ) ; India sweats it out with Pakistan ; SA prepare to face NZ .

I 'm here !

The New Year Test in Sydney is Aus vs India .
I went to the last Aus @-@ India test .

Hope that does n't happen again !
AUSTRALIAN rock legend Billy Thorpe has died this morning after suffering a major heart attack overnight .
Thorpe , 60 , died in the early hours of the morning after he was rushed to Sydney 's St Vincent 's Public Hospital at 2 am ( AEDT ) , a spokesman has said .
Did he do anything a non @-@ Aussie may recognise ?
Billy moved to the US in 1976 .
Children of the Sun was released in 1979 Top twenty .
Billy headlined his own sold out tours through 1979 and 80 .
Sometime there abouts his record lable went belly up .
Polygram assumed the rights .
Lived as fast as he died .
At least in the early years .
They should have a one minute silence up at The Cross .
After strategically '@ excising @' bits of Australia in order to thwart people smugglers ( you can n't land in Australia if we pass a law to say it IS N'T Australia this week ) , our pint @-@ sized PM has decided to think big .
How big .
Real big .
The Govt is planning to create a '@ security zone @' that extends 1,000 nautical miles around the country .
This would allow the monitoring and possible interception of any vessel within the zone .
Amazingly , other nearby nations ( Indonesia for one ) are a bit put out as it extends Australian soverienty well into Sth East Asia .
And why ?
The USA has one @....
There must be some sort of international bench @-@ mark for pissing off other nations in play here .
This Govt has also repeatadly said that it will take independent action to pre @-@ emptively strike at '@ terror @' and we are sourcing suppliers of cruise missiles .
Now , it is pretty obvious that Australia will n't be attacked from the east ( NZ ) , the south ( Antarctica ) or the west ( big ocean then Madagascar ) .
So , '@ security zone @' is shorthand for , '@ You sneaky little brown people better not try any funny business @' .
Of course they just HAPPEN to be the most populous Muslim nation on Earth - of course we should always walk tall and talk tough when dealing with them .
Could you imagine how tough Washington would be if there was the '@ Islamic Republic of Canada @' with a billion or more people sitting on their northern border ?
You will never ever appease Indonesia .
They could n't give a stuff about Australia no matter what we say .
They would have invaded us long ago if there was n't a big stretch of ocean in between .
If I were to describe accurately and succinctly my estimation of that post , australia , I might be banned .
I shall content myself by simply saying that you are utterly ignorant of where Stilly might have been , and what his experiences or feelings might be , nor do I see his whereabouts as forming the basis of any rational argument .
Perhaps fortunately , however , you have made no attempt to formulate any such argument .
Well was n't that progressive of them @...
This is the second time they 've done so .
The most amazing thing though is California , often described as the very heart of American liberalism , voted conservative on just about every one of the propositions out there .
They did approve assisted suicide , but I think voted against every other '@ liberal @' proposal .
I honestly think the pendulum is beginning to swing back from the far left .
We can always hope .
Once the traditional marriage is safe , then I am confident the people will get busy to provide a way for gay couples to enjoy the same protections as married people do , and I think that will pass with scarcely more than a murmor .
A new report on global warming , the product of a task force of academics , business leaders and politicians , chaired by former Blair administration Transport Minister Stephen Byers and Republican Senator Olympia Snowe , is deeply unsettling .
I love when those that do n't get it claim there can n't be global warming cause it 's 8 degrees and theres 3 feet of snow on the ground .
That 's actually one of the things ( record / increased snowfall ) that indicates global warning IS taking place .
What I do n't get is why some so vehemently deny global warming .
What is the benefit of denying that it is happening or accepting that it is possible ?
Ya learn something new every day @....
Ambergris is used in perfumes or as a perfume .
I thought it was a type of amber ( a tree resin product ) , but it is totally unrelated .
Ambergris is basically , sperm whale trace .
You know how hawks and coyotes vomit up the undigestible parts of their food ?
So do sperm whales .
The stuff the eject is fould and gross , but after it floats in the sun , on the ocean , for many years , it becomes ambergris - worth a small fortune too @.....

I found that quite interesting .
Imagine breaking open a chunk of a ambergris and discovering something like that @...
"@ Hey , Kris , what the hell is this thing inside the ambergris ? @"
"@ Let me have a look .

That initial article said it was banned in the US under some endangered species thingie -- why , though ?
It seems like it 's pretty separated from any harm to the animal .
( If they kill one for it , if they get anything at all they 'll some foul @-@ smelling bile that has to be floated on the sea for 10 years or more @...@ )
The ambergris itself is considered an endangered species , soz .
It is considered to be a floating ecosystem , sort of a microcosm of a rain forest , and every time one is destroyed scientists lose valuable information that might have been used for discovering a cure for cancer or some other dealdly malady .
Obama dramatically escalated the extrajudicial killings by America around the world ( mainly in Yemen , Pakistan and Afghanistan ) since taking office .
For example , in his first year in office America carried out more drone attacks in Pakistan than Bush 's entire presidency .
The next year ?
He more than doubled his own increased rate .
Obama is sending out these drones to kill people at a rate of once every 4 days .
Bush 's average was about once every 50 .
We 've made a new generation of enemies in Pakistan and Afghanistan for these assassinations ( and the "@ night raids @" Obama escalated in Afghanistan ) .
Other than Bin Laden , nobody we are killing had anything to do with 9 / 11 .
A decade later many of the young men we are assassinating ( along with the civillians that constitute one third of the number killed by these drones ) must have been kids when that happened .
Do you think this is a good idea ?
If this was Bush would you be protesting it ?
Voting against him ?
Why can Obama , the greatest drone murderer in history , get away with it with hardly a word about it ?
He even gets away with cracking jokes about predator drones while I know damn well that most of you here would have excoriated Bush for something like that .
So why is it ?
Do you all just not know that Obama has escalated the killings done in your name or do you just not care anymore ?
Is war cool now ?
Are these killing moral now ?
Why are the lives Bush was killing more valuable than the ones that Obama is killing ?
Why are you guys gonna vote for this warmonger ?
When you go on a crusade you do n't pull any punches with your headlines , do you , Robert ?
That 's a bit over the top , don'cha think ?
I stated long ago that I no longer support him .
I will vote third party , if at all , since neither major party wants to nominate somebody with my values .
I see your point , which you made well on the other thread .
I had a discussion a week or so ago with a old lib friend thinking about voting for Ron Paul , and I went on about my old theory about watching for the company someone keeps .
That 's from my hematology days , when if you find a blast cell in a peripheral smear , it was very likely a progenitor of the cells around it , thus helping identify the leukemia .
( Long ago , do n't know what they do on that now . )
Thus , I might like a Republican , but would worry about the administration that came along with him or her .
I ended with saying I 'm not all so happy about the "@ company Obama keeps @" either .
I convinced her , but my conviction on this is shallow .
She and I are both in despair about Obama for reasons already well discussed on a2k re his get along mode .
I 'm not sure she is as troubled by U.S. actions around the world as I am , but I think so .
I 'm interested in third party mavericks , but have trouble envisioning how that would work out even if I approved of the candidate .
Could Gary Johnson work out ?
Huntsman as an independent ?
Or , get elected in the first place ?
Given a Republican in office , one of those in the present batch of candidates , I have more trouble not seeing things get worse in some ugly ways re the economy and how life would work for the struggling with little income .
I 've despaired with presidents before , though .
So , lets say a Republican is elected - I can imagine increasing polarization in the citizenry as an outcome .
It might result in real change - but in just what ways ?
You sound like you 'd rather see that than put up with Dem mediocrity any further .
On that , I both see your point and am not there yet myself .
Why , I 'll say I fear things being worse ( to me ) for a while might spiral out of control .
Here 's a funny one @: when I got a job working for the local college I had to show my birth certificate before they would hire me .
Mine had been mislaid and I 'd asked if there was any way I could work in lieu of finding it , but they said @: no they would not hire me without a birth certificate .
But Barack Obama has yet to produce a valid birth certificate and is no president of the United States .
Not only does it take less paperwork to become president of the United States than a tutor at a local college , but the US constitution requires the President must be a natural born citizen !
Without requiring proof of birth we have waived this constitutional requirement .
@Muarck , Note @: this is not conservative or republican agenda .
I 'm a democrat who voted Hillary Clinton .
This is just about gross violations of the U.S. constitution .
Who are you trying to fool ?
Obama produced a valid birth certificate .
It was verified by the State of Hawaii .
It 's been upheld in numerous court proceedings .
It 's been investigated by just about every news organization out there .
But you do n't have an agenda , yeah right .
A certified copy of a birth certificate issued by the state of birth is valid legal proof of birth , acceptable in a court of law .
NO ONE gets their ORIGINAL certificate of birth .
Those always stay on file in wherever the state keeps their vital records .
Obama has shown a certified copy .
It 's been examined several times and declared valid .
The State of Hawaii has verified the original .
Give it up . He 's legal
according to the AP @....@ here 's a local link
I 've been wondering when that 'd be called !
CNN has both Missouri and NC at "@ 100 % reporting @" but they 're still not colored in .
I am shocked that this happened .
I am not unhappy but I am shocked .
The tension and animosity on the street in NC is palpable .

Last night at my gig some drunks late night were discussing what to call Obama @...@ bandying the usual right wing talk around and I said "@ I suggest you call him the motherfucking President Elect @" .

After last night 's events in Brussels , it 's clear that the UK does n't want to be a part of the Europe ( or just the EU ? ) anymore .
The continent can cope without the British .
But can the UK go to a prosperous future without the Euro , without the continent ?
What alliances are now possible ? Just the USA , or the a re @-@ organised Commonwealth ?
Where will be the future place of this country among Europe , Russia , China , the USA ?
The UK has said "@ Bye , bye Europe @" .
I hope they know the meaning of "@ Auf wiedersehen @" !
@Walter Hinteler , I can n't remember where I read the analysis , but the conclusion which made sense to me was that currency boundaries ultimately implied federal boundaries .
To be anthropomorphic , the "@ UK psyche " resists federal union with Europe as evidenced by their original reluctance to join the Eurozone .
This latest decision is symptomatic of that resistance but economic events will ultimately decide whether "@ resistance is futile @" .
It 's also a sovereignty issue -- and sovereignty is something which the EU has never effectively addressed .
Ever crucial issue is put up for a plebecite , or a vote by nation -- and the population of one or more countries , or the governments of one of more countries , torpedo the deal .
As a "@ union , @" it 's farcical .
Not too long ago , when Barack Obama campaigned for the presidency , he was all about human rights .
And man did he chastise the Republicans @' approach to them .
Time and time again , Obama emphasized ( and I 'm quoting from memory here ) that under his rule America would n't lead the world through the example of its power , but through the power of its example .
One of his first acts as president was to announce the shutdown of the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , which had come to symbolize the Bush administration 's fast , loose , and secretive approach to human rights .
Last week , the Obama administration had a perfect opportunity to act on its rhetoric , to set an example of America 's new spirit , to specifically deliver “@ change we can believe in @” .
To understand this opportunity , you have to remember that Guantanamo Bay was just the tip of the iceberg .
The rest of the iceberg , hidden underneath the waterline from public scrutiny and media symbolism , exists a system of CIA prisons in foreign countries .
When the CIA suspects people of connections to terrorism , it snatches them off the streets wherever they live , flies them to those secret prisons , and interrogates them .
Credible reports allege that the CIA uses torture to extract information from them .
( I 've written about one of the victims a little over three years ago ) .
When some of the victims are trying to pursue their cases in federal court , the Bush administration tried to throw out their cases on a theory about government secrets .
Obama , consistent with the rest of his human rights rhetoric , sharply criticized Bush for it .
But now that Bush 's secrecy theory is before an appeals court , Obama is changing his mind .
Without qualifications , he is now sticking to the Bush position that torture victims can not sue the CIA , because the torture is a state secret .
“@ Change we can believe in @” ?
Yeah right .
That is so a year ago !
It 's what most politicians would do @...@ but still @...@ sigh .
The hell of it is to whom do we turn .
The Bush and Regan policies that have put us in this position ?
We all voted for Obama because of these policies but where do we turn to really gain a government of the people for ALL the people .
Democrat , republican , all I see are crooked politicians who are only interested in thier own gain and screw the rest of us .
Well it was n't just campaign promises , he repeated it in his inauguration , when he already had the presidency in hand .
"@ We reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals . @"
Apparently he was missing some qualifiers , so I 'll fix it for him @:
"@ We sometimes reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals when it is politically convenient . @"
Yeah , I just saw this for the first time too .
Does n't look good , but I do n't know anything beyond what 's here .
Thomas -- when 's the last time you saw me say ANYTHING about Obama , yay or boo ?
I 'm still in politics detox mode and still just not following this stuff .
Also just plain not on A2K much .
This happened to be recently replied to when I checked in just now .
I wonder which couple of years he is referring to .
The power of propaganda .
Even half @-@ ways intelligent people just automatically repeat this propaganda that 's been driven into their heads .
Interesting use of subject / object pronouns .
I have been busy the last few days .
Today is the first I heard about the story on NPR .
I admit I do n't know the facts but on it 's face I disagree with the decision .
It 's 4 days old ?
It certainly had n't made it into my paper unless I skimmed over it .
Gushing like teenagers about their first crush ? I do n't gush Thomas .
This is n't really an endorsement of torture and rendition , is it ?
With nothing to go on except the link to the NYT article , it looks more like there is n't going to be legal action against CIA and the unnamed Boeing subsidiary for activities they were assured were legal at the time .
I never felt obliged to report every screwup made by the previous administration .
There were so many better qualified people to handle that .
When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 , partisans of Ronald Reagan claimed he had "@ won @" the cold war .
Although a careful review of the facts will show it was not true , the claim was that the Soviet Union became overextended attempting to keep up with Ray @-@ gun 's defense spending .
Pappy Bush , who was the president at the time , claimed that he had won the cold war since the collapse of the Soviet Union happened on his watch .
Regardless of how one views those claims , for many people -- capitalists especially -- heralded the "@ victory @" of capitalism .
Globalism was hailed by its partisans as the natural consequence of their "@ victory , @" and the sensible way to bring the alleged blessings of a problematic freedom to the people of the world .
Always impatient of any restaint , capitalists used this so-called victory as justification for the opposition to , or calls for the roll @-@ back of any regulatory restraint .
But not everyone has agreed with that view of the world and of economic systems .
Now , with the various "@ Occupy @" movements , it is ( or ought to be ) obvious that a great many people are less than enchanted with capitalism and its expression in the idustrial democracies , as well as in the countries into which capitalists from the industrial democracies go to invest .
What are your thoughts on capitalism and its activities ?
@Setanta , Unfettered capitalism has yielded an Oligarchy .
Governmental regulation is good for capitalisms evolution .
Health and safety and environmental horrors need to be regulated otherwise industries will not EVER do whats right for humanity .
@Setanta , I do n't have a problem with capitalism -- i have a problem with unregulated capitalism .
I agree with this completely .
Capitalism thrives when everyone understands the rules , plays by the rules and enforces the rules .
If everyone has to spend all their time trying to circumvent the rules , understand the rules or fighting against those not following the rules , that is where trouble really begins .
That 's the problem with "@ deregulation @" .
Removing rules does n't help business be more competitive , it means that businesses must race to the bottom to counter new businesses that start there .
It 's like changing the rules to Monopoly half way through the game so that all the previous purchases are meaningless .
That 's not a benefit to capitalism despite what some would tell you .
Out of all of the examples I saw , the only one I would agree with is the bomb toting Arab .
That is extremely rude , though I can see the humor in it .
In a college , that kind of costume should not have a place .
But these kids are listing Geisha costumes , sombreros + donkeys , and a few other costumes that they deem '@ racially insensitive @'
Racially insensitive ?
Have they not been to Mexico ?
That is a huge part of their dress when you get farther away from the cities .
How is that being insulting ?
It is not showing someone doing something derogatory , it is using the clothes of a society for a costume .
A Geisha is insensitive too .
Again , ( my opinion only ) this is taking it way over board .
Sometimes it seems people look for reasons to be offended .
It is about perspective frankly .
There will ALWAYS be someone who sees something and wants to think the worst of it .
Dressing in a costume or NOT dressing in one will not change that .
And why is it that only those races / cultures are the spotlight of being insensitive ?
Is it not JUST as rude to wear torn over alls , stained shirt , black out your teeth and be a white hillbilly ?
What about the woman who wears shorts , high heels and too much make up to be a hooker ?
There has to be a stop to this forever drive to find something insensitive .
And if someone wants to look for reasons they are being held back for what ever reason they have in their heads , they will always find justification no matter what .
But why are we as a so called free society really jumping on board this super PC behavior ?
Why is it now ok to find the smallest thing to be offended about and throw it out as the new discrimination ?
And why are these rules only applied to two or three races ?
Americans , white , black , green , blue , short , tall , fat @..
what have you , are ALL being made fun of in some way when it comes to costumes and halloween but only those 3 races get the red light ?
Is n't THAT racist ?
These students are bleeding idealism and have n't been tempered enough with time and cultural patina to realize that one should be able to laugh at oneself and one 's cultural obsessions and that these costumes are n't the evil mechanisms of racism they are betraying them to be .
This is an absolutely ridiculous thread .
I mean if racist costumes were actually being banned , you all might have a point .
I am as uptight about the plight of white people in the US as anyone is .
But did anyone else read the article ?
No one is banning Halloween costumes @..
No one is even talking about banning Halloween costumes .
In fact no one in this story wants to ban anything , except for the people here who apparently want to ban posters .
These students have a simple goal .
They say "@ @... if we can change a few people or make a few people think , then that 's awesome @" .
They are n't banning anything or stopping anybody from doing anything .
This story is about students expressing free speech .
They are making posters expressing their opinion .
Of course if you want to wear a costume that others find offensive it is free speech .
But me complaining about your costume being offensive is also free speech .
Neither should be banned .
And that is the way it works .
Whether your costume involves black face and a noose , or whether it is a grilled sandwich where I think the cheese is a little too drippy is irrelevant .
Free speech is free speech and expressing free speech is actually opposite of the "@ banning @" that is being alleged .
You all have turned this story on it 's end .
SO dear Massachusetters , does she have any chance in dethroning the sitting Republican Senator , Scott Brown ?
Why does Scott Brown need to be dethroned ? I kinda like him @...
Could Elizabeth Warren beat Scott Brown ?
I 'm not sure what either of them look like , but the most brutal fight i ever saw was a girl fight , lots of kicking , scratching , and some amazing punches ( the loser had to stay home from school for almost a week until swelling went down around her eyes )
so I 'm gonna say yes
I 'm thinking in terms of the Democratic Party getting one more Senate seat .
In Massachusetts , it would seem a lot easier task then in other Senate races .
I 'm thinking the best thing to do is keep the few moderate Republicans we have right where they are .
He may vote along party lines for most things but he 's reasonable when it comes to representing a liberal @-@ leaning constituency .
Do n't know , but it sounds like a real bellweather contest , does n't it ?
It would have made for some really great off year contest .
Care to explain why you think he is an idiot ?
He did beat Martha Coakley rather convincingly .
He served as a State Senator for several years .
He even voted for several Dem bills .
Coakley was a bad candidate who ran a terrible campaign - I 'll hunt around for a great article I read a year ago outlining the tremendous mistakes she made .
As for Brown , he has a difficult time answering questions about policy in a cogent fashion .
I have seen him on several occasions give answers which show that he has no real understanding of the underlying issue at all , and several which are really just embarrassing .
I have n't really been active in ( or even really cared about ) politics until recently and I 'm really just looking for other peoples opinions on this .
Well , just telling you who I 'll vote for probably will n't inform you much though right ?
What issues are important to you ?
Obama because I think he has done a good job in most areas ; some areas he let me down , plus there is no way I would vote for a republican today .
( I have a few times in the past , mostly local )
Anyone who is not a Republican .
I think the majority of them are the reason this country has become constipated concerning everything that is important .
They are willing to throw America under the bus in order to make Obama look bad .
OK , "@ and why @" does add a lot , you 're right .
I 'm voting for Obama because I think he has done a good job in difficult circumstances , and can do much more with another term , and because I really worry about what any of the possible Republican nominees would do as president if one of them won .
I also would n't vote for just about any republican ( especially Rick Perry ) but I have heard some good things about Ron Paul , he 's about the only republican that I 'm actually interested in learning more about .
My own opinion of Ron Paul is that I 'm happy that he 's in the race , and especially in debates .
I like how he 's anti @-@ war and anti @-@ bullshit in general .
I would absolutely not want him to be president , though .
Andrew Sullivan has a lot of posts on him , that might be a good place to start if you 're interested in learning more .
Here 's his un @-@ endorsement of Ron Paul ( he endorsed him , then had second thoughts ) @:
I read a fascinating piece in the WSJ today .
The author spoke about how Obama 's approval ratings are at a dismal low .
He apparently appears to be unable to pull Congress together to accomplish much , and in the author 's opinion , it would only get worse if he got elected to a second term .
He would like Obama to bow out for a 2 nd term , and have Hillary Clinton run for president .
He believes that Hillary has the best chance of bringing the country together .
I do n't know how she feels about running , but , IMO , I think that it is a great idea .
She certainly has the smarts , the experience , and the approval of the majority of citizens .
I think that the people on the Republican side of the fence , are a poor bunch .
There is not a one in the bunch who would capture the imagination of the American people .
The voters who will decide this election , IMO are the moderates and the independents . THEY certainly will not vote for any of the anti @-@ gay , pro @-@ life bible bangers .
What do you think ?
Should Obama step down for the good of the country ?
Should Hillary run ?
Hillary 's time has come , and gone @...
She would make her self no friend of the Democratic party by dividing them and losing the black vote @...
No one is going to vote for her that did not vote for Mr. Obama , and a whole lot less Obama voters will vote for her @...
Do n't worry though @..
She has enough sense to not try to run against a sitting president from her own party @...
Best case scenario @: Obama gets reelected and the country continues to slide backwards even if the Democrats gain a greater foothold of the US Senate and increase their collective mass in the US Congress .
Worst case scenario @: George W. Bush II ( any Republican candidate other then Huntsman , Romney , or Ron Paul ) will take the election .
Then that means the Republicans would likely further gain in Congress and even the Senate perhaps .
Then the country slides right back into the deepest of recessions .
I suspect you are wrong on the voting inclinations of the moderates , and especially the ones you call tea baggers .
Actually , I think you are wrong on the moderate / independent voter turnout , too , but I could be wrong .
I 'm expecting a fairly good anti Obama turnout amongst that group .
I could accept Hillary .
Like Phoenix , I 'm not greatly impressed by the Republican field .
Not crazy about the presumed Democratic candidate either .
On the other hand , Obama stepping aside seems even less likely than Cain giving up .
I guess that in summary , I 'm not optimistic about the future of the country for the next five years .
Kudos to NY ! . They realize that it 's not about just voting the party line , it 's about voting for what 's right .
@jcboy , Did they actually vote for gay marriage yet ?
I 'm getting a mixed message with the NY Times
@tsarstepan , They sure did !
Hopefully , other states will realize gay marriage hurts nobody .
Look at Massachusetts . They have had it since 2004 .
Have you heard of their society falling apart ? Of course not .
I think with NY , then CA , it will rapidly spread across the country .
You can n't stop this train !
@jcboy , I hope that the US Congress addresses this issue soon and just makes the whole state by state journey moot by making same sex marriage a national law .
@jcboy , You are correct .
Whether one 's home state will recognize a same sex marriage from out of state is another matter .
When I studied the Domestic Relations Law of NY , I thought it was a damned INDIGNITY for a government to give permission to citizens to marry .
The citizens created the damned government , their child . David
Did you guys hear about that plane crash that crashed into a helicopter ?
I have no idea how that happened .
What do you think ?
That is a congested airway , and when you fly under 1000 feet you have no aid from air traffic controllers .
Accidents happen , but this particular area may need additional regulation ( such as a minimum altitude requirement for the tourist helicopters ) .
My husband , our kids , and myself were spending a day out by the oceanside with another couple and their kids , our long @-@ time friends .
At some point we came across a huge fallen tree , and our friend L . climbed on it and started walking up .
Our 11 year @-@ old son followed him , but L . suddenly realized they will n't be able to get down that easily .
He turned back and asked our son to get away and down to give him room to get down , too .
Our son stopped but did n't get out of his way at once .
He was having fun , and we had to tell him 2 more times , and then he obeyed .
After that L . got back down , and he suddenly grabbed our son from behind and threw him on the ground with all his might , yelling at him .
We were stupefied .
A 215 lbs 38 year old man could have easily injured him .
Fortunately he got up unscathed albeit very frightened .
We are in deep shock , we never hit our children .
Does anybody know if there are legal ways to teach the man a lesson - but not monetary ?
Is there any point in filing a police report ?
Personally , if someone is my friend , I am going to deal with the situation on a person to person level .
Why can n't you make it sure that you were really upset and that you do n't want them hitting your kids ever again .
Legally , there are two remedies .
There is monetary damages , and there is jail time .
I suppose you could add probation ( but that is just a replacement for jail time ) .
If you go the legal route , that pretty much ends the friendship no matter what happens .
If I was angry enough to start down this path I would n't worry about where it ended up .
I would probably express my feelings on the situation and make it clear that it was not to happen again .
Your son was assaulted .
That is what the behaviour of your ex @-@ friend would be named legally .
He did n't hurt your child physically , so it was the lesser form of assault ( assault causing physical harm is seen as more serious . )
You certainly could file a police report @....
I do n't know the law where you are , here , it is quite likely that police would go around and question the man , making it clear that ( if your description is accurate ) he had committed an offence , but you could decide against filing charges .
Again , depending on where you live , you could likely notyify child protection authorities .
here , being extra @-@ familial , and given that you have already decided not to expose your child to hm again , they would simply hand it to police .
If you release a legal genie from the bottle , though , you lose control of what the genie does .
For instance , you and your son would need to make a formal statement .
It might be that police act even if you do n't want them to .
It might go to court .
I 'd personally not choose to do it tthat way @...@ though you could certainly chat to local police without naming names and see if there is such a thing as a stern chat , or a formal caution to be had in your area .
I 'd hope that a stern talk from you and the loss of the friendship would be a big message to him .
However , my concern would be how he treats his own kids .
That was one hell of an over @-@ reaction .
If you have evidence that he assaults his own kids , I 'd be considering a chold protection notification .
is your kid ok ?
That would have been scary .
Is he having nightmares or anything ?
I 'd also be having a chat with him about his behaviour .
It did n't warrant such a reaction , but he was thoughtless .
If it was really unusual behaviour from your friend , I am a bit worried about him , too , frankly .
I am a 25 year old woman , and I have been in a 2 year relationship with a 37 year old married man .
He has 2 kids one , from his marriage and one from a previous relationship .
He has been planning to get a divorce since the first day we met ,
things are so heated between us , I do n't know what to do .
He is planning on moving out of the house by the end of the year , he and his wife do not see eye to eye .
He was having sex chats with a lady he met on facebook from Sweden ,
when I found out it affected me really badly .
I felt and still feel betrayed and I can n't trust him .
How do I let go ?
@JEJE , You just walk away .
Do you really think so little of yourself that you believe this is the best you can do ?
A married man who if he really was in love with you would just go ahead and file for divorce now , or at least move out of his house now .
A man who while having a relationship with you is involved in sex chats online with others .
Personally , when you mess with a married man you deserve exactly what you get .
I have little or no pity for you .
But , you can do yourself a world of good by just walking away from him .
Then why do n't you think about looking for someone who is not attached .
Your odds of finding happiness are a bit better going that route in my opinion .
I am 24 and a mother of a 2 and a half year old .
Me and my son 's father have been broken up since August .
I want to start dating other people and my son 's father says if I do he will have nothing to do with his son .
He is very possesive and controlling but he has no right to be as we are not together .
He has too much going on in his life right now and he thinks we can work when I have told him several times I do n't love him and he does not love me .
I want him to be there for his son without needing me too .
But he has no one his family and him do n't get along and have their own issues .
I do n't want to be miserable anymore and the longer he is around the more miserable I will be .
I do n't want him to not be there for his son as he is a good father or he at least tries .
I do believe every child needs both parents weather they are together or not .
But he thinks if he can n't have me no one can .
What do I do to move on with my life .
Your ex is threatening you using your son @... bad , bad , bad .
You can n't give in to that or it will just escalate .
You have a right to live your own life and be happy , so do n't cave to his threats .
If he really loves his son , he 'll see him regardless , but this is just a typical control method that people like him use .
Others say things like , "@ I 'm going to kill myself if you leave me @" @... get it ?
Date .
Meet all kinds of people .
Do what you want .
If the price is , he voluntarily walks out of both of your lives , you 're probably better off without him .
I 'd agree - one other thing it is none of his business whether you date or not .
I would n't tell him .
Not because of his threat - but because your personal life is none of his business .
Can you document his threats ?
You really need to .
Quit taking his calls , make him leave voice mail .
Make him email or text you .
Keep those records .
Get a lawyer and get a divorce .
If you can n't afford one , try legal aid .
Tell your ex that all communication needs to go through the lawyer .
The bus drivers want exact change , the till people want exact change , the people who deliver your food want exact change @...
Do they not realise that you do n't get piles of change from the bank ,
someone somewhere is going to have to take the notes ?
People are getting lazy .
I do like to get as near as possible as i woudn't like to be couting coppers all day
take a £ 20 note on the bus , they just tell you to get on cos theyre lazy as hell
its illegal to pay certain amounts in loads of coins . such as you can only pay something like 30 pence in 1 ps
Hello I started university in September , did n't immediately gel with it obviously like most people .
However , I knew it would take me some time to adjust , because I have always been very introverted , and shy and especially anxious and all the rest of it .
The first night I was here , all my housemates and I went out and it was the hardest thing I have ever ever had to do .
To go into the SU bar on my own , sober .
Anyways more to the point ; Here are the facts @:
- I am not enjoying university having been here 5 months or so ; I 'm disillusioned by the course , not enjoying the projects set , and I do n't like the course delivery as much .
The University made out it was much better than it seems .
- I had a bad start to the first term ; student finance was delayed , adding to my stress levels , I was so worried I was unable to progress with work , conclusively it all piled up .
- I was assigned a counselor through the university ; had seen her for about 5 @-@ 6 weeks ( block sessions ) , if I 'm honest it did n't really work ; because I was never open with her .
Only half @-@ halfheartedly .
- Now the work @-@ load is up to my neck , I have major deadlines to hit , I am depressed , the anxiety is resulting in me feeling miserable all the time .
In no longer have a counselor because you can only have them for so many sessions at a time , and I doubt it will help much this time , if it has n't already .
- I lack motivation , do n't feel comfortable with any of my lecturers , feel like I want to give in , but can n't bring myself to it , because I will end up in a dead end job , and I aspired to '@ be someone @' .
- I would rather be dead than not be educated , and live a life I want to live ( and dropping out of uni would make matters worse ) .
- I 'm 21 yrs old ( turn 22 this year ) , do n't have much time left for failing need to do something .
I failed college once over , did another course so I could get to uni do n't want to go through the system over and over and consistently fail .
Can someone please give me some advice please ?
Perhaps go and see your doctor , and see if there 's any way you can get your deadlines extended to try and ease the pressure a bit ?
Send your tutors a similar email to this post ( do n't worry they 've seen it all before - some much more uncomfortable admissions too - I know as I used to work in a Uni Dept admin ) and they will consider mitigating circumstances .
Break your work into manageable chunks .
Concentrate on one bit of work at a time ( obvs the most urgent assignment first ) .
Do n't shut yourself off from your housemates , and well done for trying new things from the very beginning now keep at it !
I 'd reccomend you go and see your doctor too .
If you 've always been an anxious person you might benefit from speaking to someone ( my friend got therapy on the NHS for anxiety , so its really normal ) .
And try and get deadlines extended , if you 're honest I 'm sure your uni will allow it .
It 's getting hard to keep strong and keep carrying on with life .
My mum is getting divorced - she had a horrible time with my step @-@ father and her new found freedom has sent her round the bend .
She 's epileptic and a manic depressive with a huge anger problem .
She 's horrible to me , constantly .
I can n't cope with her outbursts and nasty hateful remarks when I 'm at home .
I 'm 18 , a full-time sixth former at a high pressure private school ( on a 95 % bursary ) and I 'm at breaking point .
I can n't do work at home , because she shouts at me .
So then my teachers get angry at me .
One minute she 's lovely , and it 's like having my mummy back , then the next , she turns into the most spiteful human alive .
I 'm not going to pass my A2 exams , I 've already accepted defeat , that this year of my life is going to make me a failure .
Maybe I can come back from this , who knows . I 've got the most amazing university offers , but I can n't even accept them - I 'll never make the grades .
I wish I could wipe her out of my life - things would be so much better without her .
But then , I think I 'm just being selfish .
But surely , my life is n't meant to be like this ?
It should be so much better . B
ut I feel as if I have no control over this downhill spiral .
And I do n't know what to do .
Thanks for reading .
It 's nice to vent .
You can n't get her sectioned for that .
Does she even have a history of mental illness or a diagnosis ?
You do n't know for sure that you will n't get good grades so accept places if you can .
Life throws **** at you all the time .
If it 's not someone in your family , it 's an outsider .
I had to deal with verbal abuse from my dad for a long 8 years before I came to uni and honestly , the only reason why I 'm here is because it was the only way out .
Work hard if you really want out .
Really sounds like you need support from somewhere else if she can n't give it to you consistently .
You could call Childline or something similar ?
You could go to the library on saturdays and do a good 8 hours of studying there .
Is there a friend 's house you could go to @- form a study group ?
So you want her sectioned cos she is a bit of a pain in the arse and you 've blamed all your problems on her ?
I know what you 're feeling .
My Mum was spat out of hell too .
I highly recommend taking up smoking
Oh grow up tsr and stop negging its was a joke !!!
I think over the last year or 2 i 've become a much weaker person and in a way have dulled down my personality inorder to try and make some friends at uni .
But being overly @-@ nice to people has lead them to believe that they can say or do whatever the hell they want to me @...
they show absolutely no respect .
e.g. i 'll say hello to someone from uni and they 'll ignore me , but 30 minutes later they 'll decide they want my help with some work @... and i 'll give it to them .
It 's causing alot of anger and distress in my life and is really starting to effect my concentration in uni .
has anyone got any experience in handling this sort of thing or how to go about gaining some respect again ?
Just say no .
Do it gradually if it 's not something you 're particularly comfortable with .
You could start with '@ No , sorry but I 'm busy @'
Of course , do n't go over the top with it lest you go in completely the opposite direction .
If , in your mind , you 're thinking no - say it .
When they start to realise that you 're not going to bend over backwards for them , they 'll start respecting you more .
well this is such a bad attitude really , of course you can be respected if you 're nice but not to the point where you just let them do anything to you , that 's not being nice it 's being a fool .
I do n't know if anyone will read this , but I just feel desperate and feel the need to tell someone .
This September I left home , and started at University . I was incredibly anxious about doing this , but rather delayed thinking about it until I got here ! Now I 'm here , and have been for over two weeks , I feel terribly overwhelmed by it all and feel unintelligent and socially awkward .
I have been struggling emotionally for the majority of my life since moving to Secondary School , although I did lose my dad at around the age of 9 and always used to blame that for my feelings . I have had two periods of counselling in my life , over roughly 15 months from December 2009 until around March this year .
I feel at the moment like the problems in my life are incredibly overwhelming , and are making me ever more doubtful of my always low self @-@ esteem . I have no ability to concentrate on work , often find myself becoming very quiet in social occasions , and doubt myself over anything and everything .
Neither of my counsellers have diagnosed me with depression , and both have suggested I do not suffer from it , but it is a huge worry to me , as depression was the cause of my dad 's death , suicide .
I have tried to solve my problems before , and have found exercise and meditation particularly useful , and have also tried things like self @-@ help books and tapes . But my general feeling , is , '@ Is this what my life will be ? My one chance at existence , my one chance of being a young man , I am wasting it ! @' And these feelings are beating away at me .
I simply do n't know what to do , and when I think of things to do , I never follow through with it . Friends often say I 'm lazy , and I can n't disagree a lot of the time . I feel like everything anyone could do to help , people have tried , and time and time again I fail .
Sorry to anyone whose read this jumbled mess , and I feel a bit like a self @-@ seeking moaner , but I truly do feel desperate .
Its not uncommon for people 's existing feelings about themselves to become more intense when they are in new situations and feel the pressure to socialise with strangers and fit into new roles , i.e. being a university student .
I am not a health professional and I can only speak from personal experience which is why I strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional about your feelings and worries about depression .
Most people feel unintelligent and awkward when they first get to uni @- you 're definitely not alone there . But I would really recommend that you get an appointment with your uni counselling services . It does n't really matter whether anyone has told you that you are depressed or not , you are obviously having some problems at the minute and could use some support @- labels are n't as important as your experiences . Meditation and exercise are really helpful , so definitely try to do those . But yeah , you will have to engage with help and life in general to get somewhere @- but do n't beat yourself up about feeling unmotivated to do anything at the minute , lots of people feel like this and hopefully it will pass as you begin to feel better . Being unkind to yourself will only make you feel worse @- be kind to yourself and get some help .
Good luck .
I think a lot more people feel the same way as you do , but medicate themselves by using friends . Whilst it probably is n't a '@ solution @' as such , being around friends whilst being depressed is definitely better than being alone and being depressed . Either way , if you fancy a chat , feel free to PM
If i were you id focus on an idol . Someone you aspire to ( not want to be them but someone who your admire and have respect for ) e.g. someone who came from a bad background and ended up successful and happy with a family and married etc. etc.
Focus on what you want to achieve in life , you have n't stated what your studying , or indeed why @....@ is it because you wanted the experience ? Because your mum wanted yo to go ? Because u need a degree for the career you want to do ?
Either way , sum up why youre there and work your bottom off to get the best grades you can , cos once you get ur degree , you wil have something you can say "@ hey i did n't fail , it was hard work and i passed @"

hope this helps
I 'm pretty much non @-@ autistic ( not diagnosed with dyspraxia but I think the doctor misdiagnosed ) , but I walk on my toes nearly all of the time .
It 's more comfortable to me .
What made them decide toe @-@ walking is a sign of autism since it seems so random and is n't always indicative ?
Well I might have signs of something on the autism spectrum but who does n't have one or two ?
You guys know what I mean .
Walking on toes can be a symptom of autism .
Having a headache can be a symptom of brain tumours .
Feeling tired a lot can be a symptom of leukaemia .
Symptoms do n't always apply but if they happen in a lot of cases ( which it clearly must do in this instance ) it 's worth noting , since otherwise nothing would ever get diagnosed .
I used to walk on my toes , but that was because I was born with strange toes that curled under and had to be straightened with surgery two years ago .
My brother 's autistic but I have n't noticed this with him either , but the spectrum is so broad and I myself probably have mild asperger 's because I have problems with communication and do n't pick up on social reactions / body language .
But then I do n't have a proper diagnosis and even having some symptoms might not mean you have a certain condition .
I walk on my toes not as much since years of being told not to .
I have dyspraxia .
So maybe you are dyspraxic or have short tendons .
People who do dance / gymnastics / ballet etc. have it drilled into them , to the point where I find it more comfortable now =P
I would n't read too much into random "@ symptoms @" like that
hello , i am a 12 year old girl ( 13 in two days ) who is addicted to self harming
i started when i was seven as i slit each firnger indevidually with sissors , and from that day i never stopped ,
it has got worse as i have a scar on my leg as i slit in my ex boyfriends name with stables , as i will n't stop cutting unless i bleed ,
i have sevral slits on my arm ,
they healed , then i cut myself with staples i robbed from school and a razor .
when i can n't find anything to cut with i take around 5 paracetmols and other drugs and i take them with larger and vodka .
as im writing this i am really tempted to cut my arm or burn myslef ,
i am addicted , when ever one heals i cut again
it think about it everyday ,
i am 12 and i am already sick of my life .
the source of this is that ; when i was 7 my dad left , and he does n't want to know me anymore ,
he just cares about his new little girl and wife , his new life , where im not wanted .
my best mate died when i was 10
i had a reltionship with a boy who is 16 and i am forbidden to speak to him because of what happened and the age diffrience
also my mum suffers from bi polar and i have depression
i do n't what to stop ,
i do n't care what i do to myself , i want to do it again and again to tourture myslef , i hate me .
however , my best mate , i love him , loads , he means the world to me and if i do anything then he will ,
i do n't tell him but he finds out ,
i do n't want to hurt him , i do n't want him to hurt himself
what do i do
thanks you for reading
Are you on any drugs or getting any therapy ?
It might be an idea to talk to your school nurse or your GP and tell them what 's going on .
Perhaps there 's a teacher at school who you trust and could tell .
If you tell people they can help you ,
if you keep it bottled up inside it 's likely to only get worse .
Trust me , it 's better to get these things as early as possible rather than let them get even worse .
Please do n't do this ,
I 'm 17 I started self harming last year , mainly cutting my arms , but I have stopped since the last few months ,
its hard but you can do it .
I feel so much happier , but seeing the scars is both a painful reminder of how I felt at that time , how strong my feelings were that I would want to do such a thing to myself !
And , also strength , you can do it , I found salvation in poetry writing and keeping a journal ,
self harming is addictive , but you can overcome it ,
remember your self harming does not define who you are .
You can overcome it .
So I think Ive got a form of OCD because for the past year , I 've found that everytime I go out , especially to Uni , I 'm always checking my belongings to make sure I have n't lost or left anything .
I often have to check twice at one go , then after 30 seconds for some reason I can n't resist checking again !
Why is this ! ?
Am I going crazy or something ?
It happens most often when I 'm carrying many things , but that is rarely and even still daily I 'm checking many times . And is this OCD to any extent ?
What can I do about this ?
If I do n't check , I get very very anxious , which does sort of go away after 15 @-@ 30 mins , but often the anxiety is so much that I can n't wait that long .
I feel if I lost my wallet or phone , then I 'm doomed or so I feel .
I just wish I could go out without worrying every 2 mins whether I 've left or lost something .
I really do n't know what to do , and am afraid of going to the GP .
They 've probably never heard of some compulsion like this and I just do n't know what to do
Do any of you have a similar '@ ritual @' ?
People would think I 'm crazy , but it 's very strangely difficult to get yourself out of this .
What advice could you give me ?
I used to do this on my way to college @-@ I had a list of items I knew I had on me and used to check compulsively on the bus .
I now have more severe anxiety and think this was just a warning sign so just try and wean yourself out of the habit while it 's relatively fresh @-@ definitely visit your doctor but also tell yourself not to keep checking these things ( easier said than done I know ) .
Doctors will have seen much worse cases so do n't worry about that !
I did about OCD in psycology today :P
To get rid of it , one way could be just to avoid the compulsive act so do n't check to see whether you have lost something , just leave it ( @:
Even though your anxiety levels would increase for a duration , they will gradualy decrease so hopefully , overtime your OCD will disappear ( @:
To me that just sounds like you being overly anxious , as opposed to having really bad OCD .
I am very obsessional to the point where I get up 20 times a night to check the locks in my house are all locked a particular way .
Sometimes although I know they 're locked I 'm convinced they 're not .
I think it becomes a real problem when the obsession starts to really interrupt your everyday routine .
You definitely are n't crazy though do n't worry and your GP will be understanding of the issue I 'm sure .
I go to therapy ( for other reasons also ) and they have encouraged me to pick a number of times to check , obviously that is less than 20 , and to stick to it and cut down that way .
I think the idea is to teach me , I 'm still '@ okay @' if I check 5 times or 20 times .
So far I have been a lot better , I think there is definitely hope of improvement for anyone that wants it .
Usually I 'm pretty calm about things and like to take things as they come and not to worry too much .
However , over the last month or two I 've found myself becoming really anxious about things , and I 'm not talking about a mere out of the blue feeling of nervousness .
I have begun to feel irrationally panicky about a variety of things which beforehand would n't worry me too much or even cross my mind as something to cause alarm bells to ring in my head .
I 'm not sure if it 's the change in lifestyle ( going from care @-@ free student to unemployed graduate ) that is causing this or if it 's a sign of other issues , but it 's beginning to bug me as it 's affecting my confidence and happiness .
I 've spoken to a few people about it including my parents but they all think the same @: that I 'm going through a random phase and that I should hold off taking action until it is clear that it is a serious problem
So was wondering what 's the best thing to do ?
Speak to a doctor about it and see if anti @-@ anxiety pills could take the edge off of things ?
See if I can speak to a counsellor ?
Or should I take the advice given by the close people around me and just keep an eye on the anxiety until it becomes a problem ?
Well I woudnt try to keep an eye on ur anxiety for a start because that will make u tense and more likely to become more panicky ( circle of demise there )
what I would try to do is focus on something that is garunteed to make you smile or feel happier as soon as you start to feel a bit panicky about anything .
Or if u can n't do that @-@ when you start to feel panicky , get one of your friends to make you laugh ( it works for me and i suffer from random panic attacks lol
This started happening to me , where I 'd just start being really anxious over tiny things , although from the sound of things , not as severely as you .
What I find helps is just talking about what is making you anxious to someone else .
Perhaps not in a moany way but I found that mentioning the thing that I was worried about to my mum and seeing her react to the situation in a calm way ( like I should have been reacting ) made me feel better about it because I knew it was n't a big deal and I did n't need to be anxious about it .
However , if it gets worse , then yes , go to the doctor 's .
I have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety that can prevent her from leaving the house and doing things because she 's so worried about what can go wrong .
The doctors gave her medication and it 's made her much better .
I 'm very close to breaking point ,
i 've loved the same girl for about six years .
I 've kept it to myself forever , then told a friend a few months ago cause I just could n't cope anymore .
Then a week 1 / 2 ago , I declared my love for the girl in a text when I was drunk .
She eventually replied a couple of days later being unbelievably kind about it , which has really just made me fall even deeper ( if this is possible ) .
I told her she would n't hear from me for a while , you know , so I can attempt to move on .
So now I 'm at the start of the move on phase , but I 'm just stuck .
I cut off most of my hair and I 've started exercising and changing my diet to try to alter the chemicals in my body to make me feel better that way , but does n't seem to be working , I 'm still miserable .
A song about love will come on my itunes ( pretty much every song in the world ) or a song that reminds me of her , and i 'll just break down .
I feel like just dropping out of uni and getting on a flight to australia and never coming back .
During a really low point last week I cut myself ( which i had n't done in years ) just because i had so much pent @-@ up emotion , i had to let it out somehow .
I really do n't know what to do or how to help myself be happy again .
People say time is a healer but I do n't know if I 'll be able to hold out that long !
Find activities to occupy your time .
There has to be something you really enjoy doing ?
Set some goals for yourself . i.e. @:
- Go to the gym 5 times a week for an hour a day .
- Read x books in a month .
- Platinum all the God of War games .
- Meet one new person a day and engage in a meaningful conversation .
- Learn a new skill ( could be playing an instrument , drawing , trying a new sport , web design , etc. ) .
Just some examples .
Find an activity you like , set some goals , stick to them .
The key is to occupy yourself and meet new people .
Maybe make a new playlist on itunes for starters , with happy music . '@ Do n't stop @' by Fleetwood mac , etc.
Things that do n't make you think of her .
Try , like /\ /\ suggested , getting a hobby , going to the gym etc.
It will n't be easy , but it 's just one of these things in life .
Try counting all the things that you do have in life ,
sure you might not have her , but I 'm sure you have a number of other things .
You 're in uni arn't you ??
Well , a large percentage of the population do n't have that , and I 'm sure you can finish the list .
It might seem impossible at the moment , but pick yourself up and live life with as much energy as you can .
Talking to people on here is always a place to start , have made some wonderful friends on here
Turn to religion .
When I was in your exact same position I turned to religion and Islam has worked very well boosting up my self @-@ content .
I really like this girl and she 's in a few of my classes at university .
Everytime i look at her i find her looking banck at me .
Regardless I do n't know her that well but i fancy her a lot .
I was going to ask her out but for the past few weeks i 've been waiting for the right time ( which never comes , partly coz I 'm scared ) .
But being valentines day , should i ask her out and give her a card , or would that be cheesy .
Maybe i should just wait for valentines to go .
I see her tomorrow and i could approach her .
I sometimes worry what her mates will think of me , i do n't know I 'm nervous but it has to be done so i can move on i guess
Forget about the friends ; if she 's a nice girl , go for it !
Be casual , as you run the risk of coming on too strong if you do anything seriously Valentine 's -y .
I would suggest waiting until Thursday or so ( let the V-day aura float by a bit ) , and then ask her if she 's got plans Sunday afternoon for coffee .
Low pressure , maximum talking time .
Good luck !
Well , in my estimation , while it is "@ romantic @" to ask on Valentine 's day , it 's also high @-@ pressure .
It 's your decision , obviously .
Either way , coffee date ( or something similar . )
And do ask !
Ask as soon as you can manage to get it off your chest .
Asked my girlfriend what fantasies she wants to indulge in , turns out she wants to have a threesome with a lesbian / bi friend of hers that 's wanted to **** her for ages .
And yes the third party is fit and has let my gf touch her before .
My girlfriend is straight but she gets a kick out of pleasuring people , if that makes sense .
I 'm really kind of split on the issue tbh , I do n't have much experience with this sort of thing , if I was in a no @-@ strings relationship they would be no stopping me , but I can n't help feeling that going through with it would spoil things between us .
But then again we 're young and it is something I 'd like to kick off the bucket list , as it were .
Anyone have any experiences with this before ?
Good or bad ?
What should I look out for / be careful of , really do n't want to ruin things with my girlfriend , but the idea of a threesome is thrilling , not gunna lie .
Not really , threesomes in relationships can really cause issues ,
not to mention the reality is oft very different from the fantasy .
Im sexually open minded but theres no way id share my gf with a boy or girl .
If im single yeah sure , attached no way .
If my gf suggested it id tell her no , straight out .
Sorry but i do n't share .
Oh and ive had threesomes before someone says it - both MMF and FFM
If you are n't planning on being with this girl forever then go for it .
If you 're engaged or some **** then best not to .
If her friend has wanted to '@ f**k her for ages @' I doubt it will end well
Apparentley threesomes can really ruin relationships , as they can make people insecure and unconfident .
Fantasy is sometimes better than reality .
If you have any insecurities at all , then I would recommend you not do it .
Like people have said , in theory , it 's great .
In reality , things are a lot more complicated .
I 've been with my girlfriend for well over a year now , and I 'm quite selfless towards her .
I do everything I can to make her life easier and better , and we both love each other .
It means that I spend generously if needed and put a lot of time and effort into the relationship .
However , the other night , I brought up "@ the future @" .
As in , thinking about where we 'd be a couple years from now and how serious she was about staying with me .
Turns out , that she did n't really like me that much when we started dating and she was just seeing how things went ( although now she says she is very happy , but surprised , that she has stayed with me this long ) .
I asked her what she thought about where we 'd be and she said she does n't want to think about that , and that I should be happy about the experiences we 've had ( which I am ) .
My issue is that , should I continue putting so much effort into her if it just seems like I 'm "@ what 's good right now @" for her , although it seems as if she does n't want to make any plans or even hope to stay together for a long time .
It just seems unfair that I 'm putting in a lot more effort into this relationship and that if we did break up , she 'd have gained a lot more than I did as a result .
Any thoughts ?
In your situation I would say enjoy the moment you 're in now .
Currently I 'm on the fence in regards to getting more serious with a guy who is technically still married , has two children and has openly told me does not want to get married again or have any more kids .
If you ever find yourself in a situation like this thinking about the future early on is a must in my opinion because there is a lot more at stake .
My boyfriend has one of those jobs where he 's on call a lot .
This year he 's on call for our anniversary .
This happens a lot .
He said we 'll not make reservations but we will make plans etc. but not to bank on it .
I 'm not angry at him @- I 'm in uni and I know how it is for things to change suddenly .
But I need to find a way to cope with this .
If I get all dressed up and sit waiting , he often texts me saying he has to cancel .
The disappointment is horrible .
If I do n't get ready , he comes home and I 'm in my pjyamas , not showered or ready in anyway .
It ruins the night because I have to run around and get ready and I do n't get to do any of the things I wanted to .
Is there anyway to
Bless you I know where you 're coming from .
My boyfriend is a bobby so he often has to stay late because of a job , he 's been hours and hours before getting back .
It makes it harder because we 're in an LDR so we have little time together anyway and with me at uni and him with only two days off a week now in comparision to the three / four it 's hard .
I do n't think you can not get disappointed .
The job demands it .
I realise that and sounds like you do too but it does n't make it any easier .
It 's just something we have to deal with .
Value the moments you do get to spend together , try not to plan things in advance if things are likely to cancel but be prepared for a bit of spontaneity , maybe have an outfit already in your head you could wear at last minute ?
It 's frustrating , you 're not alone in feeling the way you do .
I 'm studying abroad for a year and my boyfriend is going to come visit me a few times times .
Should I pay for some / half / any of his plane ticket ?
I feel bad when I have all this spare loan money and he 's having to save up for weeks to come see me , which is something we both want .
What do I do ?
I 'd discuss it with him -
I did n't do abroad , but when my ex and I were apart he 'd pay for his tickets and I 'd pay for everything whilst he was staying at mine -@ food , transport etc. ( when he let me anyway ) .
So really it depends on how much the tickets are costing .
I guess as he 's having to save up that living costs will n't cover it .
I 'd suggest either half , or if it makes him feel less bad about it , alternate - so he pays for the first trip , you pay for the second etc.
When I lived abroad my boyfriend at the time would pay for his flights
( they were n't much luckily ) and I would pay for most of the stuff when he was there ; eating out @...@ etc.
So my life 's been quiet now for a pretty long length of time @...
i'v had the occasions of seeing guys , but it never ends good or lasts long .
Since november last year i have n't been in a proper relationship and life 's getting a bit too quiet for my liking .
I can n't seem to meet any new genuine guys .
Their all '@ manwhores @' to put it bluntly .
Some that i meet , i 'll be physically attracted to them @..@ but they have no personality to them @..@ you could say their like male barbie dolls .
However , some i will meet who have such a lovely personality , but i will n't be attracted to them physically .
I can n't seem to find someone with that '@ connection @' if you know what I 'm saying .
Im starting to feel like it 's me who is the problem .
I can n't seem to find anyone who is n't just interested in sex @...
advice please ! ?
Use your gold digger ability and find a rich man .
Meh i have the same problem just in reverse .
It does get a bit demoralising sometimes when everyone around you is in a relationship , especially now which is probably the worst time of year to be single .
I would n't blame yourself though , you probably just have n't had an opportunity come along .
I 've met plenty of nice girls at uni but it takes a lot for me to actually develop feelings for someone , and i can n't say i 've met anyone who i genuinely have feelings for .
I 'd rather wait until i do then find a girlfriend for the sake of it - try and think of things that way ?
Just have to keep putting yourself out there i guess , if you 're constantly meeting new people or getting better acquainted with people you already know , an opportunity will come up eventually .
Theres a fair chance you 've caught someones eye already and they 're keeping quiet about it
So me and my ex broke up about 2 and a half months ago .
Do n't know how it all happened but she said she 'd like to see me during the Christmas holidays .
Now I had this weird thing going on with this breakup @.. for the first 2 weeks I felt totally heartbroken , then I was getting on good for a while , then went back to being really sad , etc.
Before I came back I felt like I was over it ; then I came back , and suddenly , yet again feel unhappy .
It 's really goddamn annoying .
Either way , from what I 've heard , she is n't really the same kind of person she was when we were together ( in a good way for me ; apparently like the kind of girl I 'm not interested in ) , so meeting with her might totally kill whatever residual feelings there are and I can get on with my life .
Or it will n't work and I 'll spiral back into sadness .
Or we may get back together , since she told me she might feel differently in the future . ( ie , want me back , after a break that 's less '@ stressful @' ; not that we ever had a stressful time @.. ) .
I do n't think this is ideal , but I 'm an idiot . I know I still feel kind of possessive over her @..
I hate the thought of her with another guy .
So should I meet with her ? Or not ? Or delete her out of my life entirely ? or what @..
depending on what you want .
if you want her back , do it .
if you want to be over her , do n't go .
I would say 90 % chance that will end up feeling even more sad than you are if you go see her , coz feeling do n't just die in 2 months ( unless there was nothing at the start ) .
I met up with my ex after 2 years of no contact at all and still feelings came back .
so yeah , do n't fool yourself . whatever that girl is doing now is probably just a pretend , trying to move on , be a changed person , ect ect .
Do n't expect to feel nothing when you see her .
ok its very important to know this quote : "@ Once a girl leaves her boyfriend , the only reason she might wanna be back is to hurt her bf @"
Dude , do n't meet up with her even if you love her to death because once you have broken up , there is no way back and all this meeting will do to you is to make you feel upset afterwards .
I was in the similar situation couple of momth ago and i just kept this girl away from me and you ought to do the same since once something is over , then it is OVER
I really need advice .
Me and my boyfriend started dating when we were 16 , and we 're now at uni still going out .
He 's always been the sweetest guy , I mean really nice and funny but these past few months things have changed .
He 's had problems at home lately , and things have been really tough for him .
Im surprised how well he dealt with it all .
But recently I 've learnt not to bring it up in conversation or he 'll get really angry about it .
I do n't want to go into details but lately he 's been getting agry at the slightest things , and if I can n't calm him down he 'll get violent especially after a drink .
He 'll always laugh it off afterwards as if he did n't mean it , and I know he does n't because he is a good guy .
I 've tried talking to him about it several times , telling him I 'll leave him if he does it again but it has n't stopped , and he has such a hold on me I do n't think I could never leave him .
Im so emotionally drained and do n't want any friends to know because they 'll just think bad of him , when really he is good deep down .
Sorry for the rambling , I just needed to get that out .
I 'm posting anonymously because what I am going to say is very personal .
Just over two years ago my girlfriends step @-@ father was hurting her mum .
My girlfriend went to help her mum and in turn was hit over the head by a glass bottle . As you might expect the police were called and the prick was arrested .
He appeared in court the next day and plead not @-@ guilty to assaulting her mum and assaulting her to her injury ( serious assault in scotland ) .
Now this is where my story gets really sick .
I type this and I am full of rage .
My girlfriends mum writes to the court and asks for her husbands bail conditions to be dropped as well as for the charges to be dropped .
She tells the court NOT to write to her at her own address or phone her home - this stopped my girlfriend from finding out what her mum was up to .
In Scotland , domestic abuse charges are not dropped if a victim requests for them to be dropped .
Though the bail conditions were dropped by the High Court in Edinburgh - this allowed the cowardly little prick to contact my girlfriend , her mum and enter the family home .
We found this out on December 23 rd 2009 at about 7.30 pm when her mum phoned her to say her husband was back in the house and wanted to talk about what happened .
We phoned the police because as far as we were aware bail conditions were still in place .
There was nothing they could do .
Her mum kicked her out on Christmas Eve 2009 to allow the prick to stay .
I was raging .
Seeing my girlfriend in tears at 16 years old was absolutely heart @-@ breaking for me .
I did not know how to help but all I did was worry and worry .
My behaviour started to change , I had recently started a career in the Merchant Navy but due to stress I started to develop problems .
I was eventually referred to a psychologist by my GP to deal with anxiety .
When the case went to trial , her mother lied and said my girlfriend attacked him .
The **** was found not @-@ guilty .
My girlfriend was heart broken .
I lost it , I went absolutely crazy .
If my mum had not calmed me down then I would be in prison just now .
Two years on and my girlfriend has forgiven her mum .
They live in a flat and the mum disappears at the weekend - 10 points if you can guess who she goes to see .
I HAVE NOT FORGIVEN HER MUM .
I do not visit the flat when her mum is in .
I have had arguments with her mum where I have said some absolutely vile things which I am not in the least bit proud about .
I have asked my girlfriend to stay with her dad as I still worry .
Basically me not liking her mum affects our relationship a little bit - if we were ever to take the next step and eventually get married then I do not know how we would do it , though my girlfriend assures me that we would manage somehow .
I still think about the incident a lot .
What I am trying to say is that domestic abuse does not just affect you - it will affect everyone you care about .
Please take what I have said to heart and leave this guy .
Been with a guy for over 3 years .
He 's been acting really weird recently .
He has n't picked up literally 7 / 8 of my calls .
Has n't returned any texts either .
I did get to speak to him the last time I rung him ( after him blanking 7 / 8 calls ) and I asked him what 's up but he did n't tell me ( this was over a month ago ) .
The fact that its a long distance relationship does n't make it any better .
He did this before once two years ago as well over nothing but I can n't really remember how it proceeded @...@ i guess he just gradually starting calling again .
Apart from this , we have had a very loving and almost perfect relationship .
I 'm starting to lose trust in him now .
I do n't know if I 'm overreacting , but I just feel really hurt about the way he 's neglecting me again and I 'm literally crying as I write this .
I let him get away with it last time but I 've had enough .
I do n't know what I aim to achieve writing this on a student forum , but any ideas on what should I do ? is it worth ending the relationship ?
I do n't wanna ring him any more because I feel insulted that he just casually blanks my calls .
And asking him does n't help either since he 's not gunna tell me .
Hmm @...@ good few issues here .
Personally , I do n't think long @-@ distant relationships would be successful .
The playing hard to get , in reflection to what others have said , is clearly not to way to go , since you 're already living far from each other already .
I think that there 's a range of possibilities as to why he 's acting this way @:
1 ) He 's got something to hide .
If you 're saying he acted this way before about 2 years ago and then perfectly fine later on , there 's clearly something going on in his mind .
I do n't know if that 's cheating or if there 's something else , but there 's clearly something he 's not sharing with you
2 ) He 's fed up with the relationship .
3 ) He 's autonomous and needs a LOT of space .
I 'm exactly the same .
Even if it 's a long distant relationship , sometimes receiving phonecalls ( depending on how often you 'd call him ) could actually affect his perception on how he feels about the relationship .
I think if you were to give him a '@ taste of his own medicine @' then effectively you might receive the response you 're expecting but I think what 's missing here most is communication .
When you see him next time , do n't criticise or start questioning him .
Just express your worries to him and maybe you 'll get something out of him .
Edit @: I do n't understand the neg .
Ok so I am female and like males , always have , obsessed with a few male celebs and see myself wth guys .
However occassionally I seem to have feelings for older females but I 'm not sure if they are like sexual feelings and it 's quite confusing .
For the first time there is a female who I like whos quite a bit older and I definitely have feelings .
I know that she is n't straight .
I deliberately try to talk to her and spend time with her even though shes clearly quite a bit older .
Perhaps they are more feelings because I look up to the person ?
I 'm really not sure , does anyone have any ideas ?
What does this mean ?
it seems strange when I am physically attracted to men ?
If you 're physically attracted to men and you 're not sexually aroused by her , I 'd say you have your answer there It might be that you get nervous and your heart beats faster because you are anxious to please her , or her opinion of you matters to you ?
If you scour the forums and do a search , you 'll see that you 're not the only one who has ever felt like this about a teacher of the same gender .
I used to - in fact , still ! - attach to female teachers and tutors a lot .
My counsellor had great fun dissecting it and telling me how I 'm sexually attracted to mother figures , but he was just an arse
I was n't in a relationship with this guy but we 've been seeing each other .
In first year we were always together in the same group of friends @..
it was fine .
Now in second year , he 's decided he does n't want to see me anymore .
He wants to be '@ friends @' .
But I know he does n't really want to be friends at all .
I think he 's got someone else @.. and that 's why he 's finished it but I do n't really care that he 's finished it .
What I do care about is that I 've been completely cut out .
He lives in the same place as me and has n't spoken to me once since .
I 've been cut out of nights out , get togethers @.. etc. all because I 'm not seeing him anymore .
This really upsets me , I want to be friends with him and I 'm willing to be but he seems to have cut me out so now I 'm not seeing other people either
Really hate it .
What can I do / say ?
Other people have cut me out because I 'm not with him anymore either !
This is what you do :
In future you make your own friends , not someone elses .
This is what you say :
Oh well , life 's not over .
My ex cut me out as soon as he got a new gf even though he promised to be friends , and that was 2 months ago
so my best piece of advice is try to move on
its bloody hurtful and hard
at first i spent the first 5 weeks cryingmy eyes out not sleeping , then it ended up that i felt i had done something wrong and therefore he dumped me
he let me blame myself and for weeks i kept thinking what if i had said this or done that , and then i found out him and his new gf were togther behind my back and i was nothing to do with it , .
So i think if you have like one other friend go out with them , maybe get a job or hobby and meet new people show him you do n't care these boys love to think we are sitting at home waiting for their text which we might be but they can n't know that
I have never done something like this before , but i have nobody to ask / talk to for advice as i can n't tell anybody i know
my ex boyfriend had been with me for about 7 months when he went to uni he cheated on me and dumped me .
He is now in a official relationship with the girl he cheated on me with , becuase of this we have no spoken since he dumped me 2 months ago
it was a VERY VERY VERY bad break up
However when we did break up i was a bit of a idiot and begged him not to leave me becuase i was in love with him ,
However ive been feeling ill for a few weeks and went i went to the doctor she said im potentially pregnant .
Im freaking out
yes i need to do a test but i do n't know when as i can n't let anybody find out ,
also i feel i can n't tell nmy ex as he thinks everything i do is for his attention to gain him back ,
if i tell him i might be pregnant he willl assume im lying to break up him and his new gf which im not but i do n't know what to do
im scared and i do n't know how i can tell hiim without him accusing me of being a liar .
She said you 're "@ potentially pregnant @" ?
What kind of a doctor would say that without giving you a test ?
do a test and get it all over and done with
How about you do a test first and then think of the how to approach it ?
...@ take it from one who knows , no Doctor is going to tell you that you might be pregnant , and then send you home to deal with it .
I do n't understand why you have n't done a pregnancy test .
they only cost about £ 3 or so .
Get on and do it and then sort yourself out .
Go straight to the doctor .
Like get up and go now .
They 'll give you another test just to make sure ( however pregnancy tests are rarely wrong when they read positive ) .
They will discuss your options with you and probably direct you towards some people who can give you counselling if you ask .
Your options are obviously @: termination , continue with pregnancy and have the child adopted , continue with pregnancy and keep the child .
First off , it 's best that I explain that I 've barely any experience with girls .
I 'm in my second year of uni and I , um , '@ opened my account @' in the sexual world the other night with a girl at my student union .
We 've met a few times before and have quite a few mutual friends , so she was n't a complete stranger .
Went back to hers for the night ( she chose that location because she had lectures the following morning ) and thought I handled the actual sex relatively well @...
The problem I have lies in the aftermath .
I can be pretty insecure at times ( it 's a wonder I actually made it back to hers , because I was worried I was imposing too much ) , and when I woke up I panicked and said I had to go and get some work done ( which I genuinely did , although thinking back on it , it was a weak reason to leave ) .
She decided not to go in for her lecture ( which I eventually realised was probably a hint for me to stay for a bit ) and we had a pretty friendly chat whilst I collected my phone , keys etc. together .
She even asked if I wanted her to come back to mine , but I refused and said something stupid like '@ nah it 's okay , have a lie in @' , which I 've been kicking myself for .
I just got myself into a panic and had a mental block .
So I left , and sent her a light @-@ hearted text a couple of hours later apologising for leaving so hastily and hoping that she had a good night @... and did n't get a response .
From here , I do n't know where to go .
To her , I probably came off as someone who does this all the time , and she was just one girl on a list of dozens I 've had one night stands with .
I just felt like I was a bit clinical and almost rude , especially with her asking if I wanted her to come back with me .
All I want to do now is somehow show her that I 'm not an absolute prick , without seeming too desperate or clingy .
I realise the error of my ways , and have beaten myself up over it massively ever since I left hers @...
I do n't think it 's a completely irretrievable situation , because she 's genuinely a lovely girl , and I reckon I can convince her I 'm not the womanising idiot she ( probably ) thinks I am @... but my lack of experience with girls leaves me with no idea what to do .
Help , please ! ? ! ?
i see what you mean .
i 'd suggest giving her another text asking perhaps to meet up - cinema , dvd , or grab a coffee / lunch before lectures or something .
if she ignores this too then just move on to the next
then again , she might n't want anything serious , so just go slow .
Just text her and invite her to go out .
To clarify are you just looking to '@ have fun @' with the girl , or are you cool with the idea of going a little serious ?
I get the impression she likes you and is maybe looking for something a little bit serious than occasional banging @..
I 'm not really sure , to be honest .
I kinda wanna take it one step at a time .
Asking her out for a cuppa could be a good idea , although I do n't want to do that just as a way of saying sorry .
I 'd rather clear the air first and show her that I know I made a mistake before getting into anything else with her .
you complete bloody numpty
you have learnt a valuable lesson
I 'm scared as to how he might react and it 's been 4 weeks and I 've still not found the perfect moment to tell him .
Also I 'm afraid what if he does n't want to keep it when I really do .
Although he 's a couple of year older than me ( 19 ) , he can act really immature , aggressive , and violent at time .
My parents have come to terms with it now after having little mini heart attacks , it 's just how can I break it to him ?
I think you should break it to him gentally .
Make sure your having a proper convo like one on one and eye contact , then break it to him .
Remember it will be a shock to him but hopefully in the end he will pull though and surport you .
I do n't think there is a way to tell him other than just being straight to the point .
Regardless of his reaction or personal feelings about pregnancy or abortion , he has a right to know .
Talk to him about what you want to do and what he would like to happen .
If you agree , great . If you can n't then talking to your parents might be the next best thing .
Well he asked you to get the morning after pill , did you say you would ?
If you agreed to take the morning after pill but did n't then that 's quite unfair and he will be annoyed .
It 's obvious he did n't want a baby because he was using contraception and even though it failed he did say he wanted you to take the morning after pill , so do n't be surprised if he does a runner .
You just have to be honest with him and hopefully he will take care of his responsibilities .
You said your Mum knows ?
Well break the news with her by your side then , hopefully your boyfriend will n't get violent or anything .
Give him time to digest the information .
It will come as a shock , particularly if you thought you 'd played it safe .
I know you said you did n't think you could have an abortion , but it 's important to talk things through with him and decide what 's best to do for both of you and , most importantly , for the baby .
Yeah I 'll tell you guys tomorrow I 'm just afraid as he 's prone to act violent at times .
+ He told me to take the pill and I did n't and he 's gonna be like '@ WTF There 's no way I can support a child at 19 and that you should n't be having a kid as you 're not even 18 yet blah blah blah @' @...
So I 'll just tell him he does n't have to be involved with our child financially and I just want him to be there for it as a fatherly figure ( which I doubt he can commit to ) as my Parents can support us anyways .
This is going to sound harsh and I understand it is your body , but I am going to be brutally honest .
Get an abortion .
Firstly , you may want to keep it , but think about it in the long run .
What kind of life will the baby live ?
You are still a kid yourself , around 16 / 17 I would assume .
I doubt you will be able to give it a good life .
Also your boyfriend .
I doubt he will be happy and most of the time , boys in this situation will bail .
He is 19 , I doubt he has any long term plans to stay with you .
By keeping the baby you are pretty much being selfish .
Yeah its your body , but there are 2 people you need to think about :
1 . The baby . I can almost guarantee you will not be able to give the baby a good life because of how young you are , and I doubt the father will stay .
2 . Your boyfreind . He is 19 , you are dragging him down for life at such a young age by keeping it .
Actually 3 people .
Yourself . You may end up regretting it in the long run .
Having a baby is a huge responsibility .
This is children having children .
Do everyone a favor and have an abortion .
Harsh but true .
You will just end up adding to the long and miserable statistic .
EDIT @: Can n't believe I was actually negged for this . Truth ****ing hurts .
I 'm confused , i love him or i thought i did so why am i turned off him now ?
He admitted to me that he is bisexual we were talking about ex 's and he told me about one ex who is another guy .
I was shocked and asked him why he did n't tell me before , he said he did n't see a reason to tell me because he liked me a lot .
He should have told me , I 'm turned off at the thought of him with other guys and being sexually attracted to another guy .
Will this feeling go away or shall i break up ?
Do n't feel guilty for feeling like that .
Nothing wrong with being bi , but just as bi 's have a taste for guys and girls , some people do n't have a taste for bi 's , if you know what I mean ?
If you 're really into him stick around , maybe it 's just the shock that 's making you feel this way .
Maybe wait a few days and see how the news settles with you before making a decision ?
Everyone has a past , to judge him on his would be unfair if you love him .
But if it turns you off or you can n't come to terms with it then its probably best to break it off .
Either way , give yourself a few days to think about it first if you 're not sure .
I 've suffered with excess body hair since I was young , and I was bullied because of it through primary / secondary school and now am unable to wear tshirts etc. in public because of how paranoid I am about it .
I went to the doctors because of it when I was around 11 , and they did a blood test but it came back normal so I assume I do n't have PCOS .
I have very hairy arms for a girl , not thick hairs like a males but lots of very noticeable , dark and long ( I bleach regularly but it only lasts a day or two before the roots are noticeable ) .
I have never shaved them because I shave my legs and get terrible ingrown hairs , even though I moisturise / exfoliate etc.
I 've tried waxing but it only lasted 2 days before the hairs began to grow back , so it 's really not worth it .
Anyway I checked out reviews and after shopping around I decided to get the £ 350 Boots Smooth Skin Plus Intense Pulsed Light permanent hair reduction machine .
The reviews were on the whole very good , it comes with 20,000 flashes ( it takes between 70 @-@ 100 flashes to do my arms each time I think ) and you need applicator gel which is £ 3 .
It appears to do exactly the same thing as you would get in a laser clinic , but cheaper and means I will be able to target any missed hairs you might get going to a clinic and it 's obviously private / convenient .
The sales assistant in Boots was very helpful , and assured me I could get a no @-@ quibble refund if I find it does n't work but she assured me it will .
I 'm going to use it on my arms first of all , because this is the area that affects me the most confidence wise , but will gradually move on to other areas .
For permanent hair reduction I will need to use the machine once a week for between 6 @-@ 12 weeks ( although I will probably need 12 weeks ! ) and will start using it tonight .
I 'm quite sceptical over whether it will work but because I 'm confident I can return it , I think it was worth the risk .
I know other girls on here have the same issue with excess body hair , so will monitor the hair reduction over the 12 weeks course to let you know how it goes incase anyone else is thinking of buying one
Week 1 @: Shaved my arms and zapped them today , did it in two separate goes ( took around 30 mins to do each arm ) and my sister did them for me just because certain angles are tricky to get to .
On a pain scale I 'd give it 2 / 10 ( just feels like a hot , tingling sensation for about 1 second then fades ) .
Will update what the regrowth is like next Saturday .
Week 2 @: Had to shave my arms again last night all over , hair regrowth not as course or fast as expected but still widespread .
Just finished zapping them again but this time did it myself , found it to be much quicker .
I was thinking of buying one of these because I just think it would be the best thing ever to never have to shave my bikini area again !
Let us know how you get on !
If this works well I would definitely buy one , I hate shaving and my arms are quite hairy as well ( I do n't shave or bleach them but I am self conscious ) , so I 'd love to be hair free forever .
Please let us know how you get on
Thanks for doing this , OP .
I 've been debating whether to get one of these machines too .
I really hope it works for you .
I hope it works too !
I suffer from excess body hair and would love for a machine that could get rid of it !
Is there any way you can use this kind of thing on your face ?
I assume goggles would be necessary but it would be really nice if it were possible .
I have been looking both at this and the Phillips Lumea , which is a little more expensive , but I keep thinking it 's too much of an expense for something that I 'm not 100 % sure will work .
Looking forward to hearing what your results are like for this , as I 'd love to be able to buy something that would mean I would n't have to shave every two days in the summer !
Without any cosmetic enhancements .
Tips ? hints ?
In an ideal world I 'd like to hit a 8 / 10 .
I ask this because I want to start '@ mingling @' .
I 'd like to look like '@ something special @' for once .
Styling your hair and cloth helps a lot .
A bit of make @-@ up , almost every girl wears make @-@ up .
Some nice accessories would help too .
Dye your hair a ridic colour .
Wear really weird earrings .
Wear clashing colours !
Bright red ( or orange , or any colour , if you 're confident enough ) lippy .
Im really pale and sick of using fake tan @...@ coming out patchy and smelling like curry is awful !
I have loads of freckles over my body so it does n't even look nice natural !
I wanted to start using sunbeds @...@ not to often but just to build a nice natural tan !
But when i go on holiday i burn really easily so i was wondering whether i would burn if i went on the sunbeds or if i built it up it would be gradually get my skin to go tanned ?
Do n't use sunbeds .
Pale freckly skin is lovely , and sunbeds are really dangerous and just not good for you .
Sunbeds are very dangerous , especially with regular use and for people with naturally pale complexions , and you say you have '@ freckles @' all over your body .
Some of these may be moles and so it 's just not safe .
Invest in a proffessional fake spray tan - there are more and more salons .
Or just be pale and beautiful as I am
I am so confused and annoyed !
My mac nc55 studio fix fluid was perfect for my face a couple of months ago but now my face looks dull and @...@ muddy / ashy ?
Also my face and chest had a ridiculous colour difference .
I googled nc45 just now and the girls actually look around my skin tone :/
Is it possible to go from nc55 to nc45 ?
My problem is where I should match my foundation to .
My face is medium , my neck slightly darker and my chest so pale ( compare to face and arms ) it 's unbelieveable .
I would actually call my chest an nc 44 .
So what do I do ?
I feel I would look ghostly if I used nc45 but then my chest and face would be the same , help !
Yes I have to different MAC foundations because my skin changes all the time .
I would suggest going to the counter and asking them to match you again .
Someone said that NW30/ 35 is meant to be a good shade for ( brown / black ) people who find themselves changing shades
If you matched it to your chest would n't your neck look weird though ?
I would always say to match to your face as your natural colouring will always suit you best .
I 'm very pale caucasian and my chest is darker than my face , if I were to match to my chest I 'd just look a bit mucky , like I had n't washed in weeks , and I think that if your foundation does n't completely blend into your natural skintone along your jawline you can look like you 're wearing a mask .
I recommend getting colour matched to your jawline and then adjust with bronzers / highlighters .
I got my nose pierced a couple of weeks ago with a stud .
It 's not a bone so it is literally just a stud , similar to earrings .
Because of this is falls out all the time as theres nothing inside to keep it in place .
I want to change to an L-shaped stud , but I 'm worried it will n't go in easily because i 've had it pierced with a straight stud .
Any advice ?
Why the hell did they pierce you with a straight stud ?
Go back to the piercer and ask for it to be changed or find a piercer who will , they should be able to swap it without any fuss .
I had mine pierced with a straight stud , it was flipping awkward .
Do n't do what I did though , and change it before the 6 weeks or whatever , as you will probably get an infection which comes up as a nasty wart thing on your nose . D @:
The L-shaped studs are different to put in to the straight ones , but if you get the technique right , once you do it correctly , you can do it again .
You put the first bit of the L shape in the hole , making sure you can feel the tip of the end on the inside of your nose .
Then press firmly , twisting slightly upwards and it should slide in .
If you still have troubles , just go see the piercer and they 'll put it in for you
I noticed i was getting these permanent forehead lines and that my face was a bit dry .
I decided to use some moisturizer and its helped .
Do many other guys choose to moisturize ?
I use clarins for men :-)
The daily wash on my face , the exfoliating scrub twice a week , and the anti @-@ shine moisturiser on a daily basis ( at least ) .
I have tried the cheaper brands , loreal and nivea , and I think they make my skin feel worse .
I use cheap generic moisturiser after shaving because my skin gets dry and sometimes tender after shaving .
I only do it after a shave because otherwise the facial hair stops it from melting into the skin properly .
Any moisturiser labelled as '@ aftershave balm @' or '@ aftershave lotion @' or '@ for men @' etc. is just a big rip off .
It is exactly the same stuff as cheap moisturiser but it is marketed towards meathead guys who think that moisturiser is '@ liek so gay @' .
Nivea aftershave lotion is around £ 3 @-@ 5 for a tiny 100 ml bottle wheras you can get a big 500 ml bottle of generic stuff for about a pound that has exactly the same effect .
This is just the modern day version of the old '@ mansize tissues @' marketing one @-@ two .
"@ Oh , it has the word '@ man @' in it so it is n't gay anymore @"
I had grade 2 acne and it was particularly bad when I '@ overwashed @' so I was compelled to wash less and to start moisturising ( Nivea @: Dry Skin , after washing or shaving ) in my late teens .
I also use moisturising shower gel or I get BACNE , nice
Result is my skin is smoother than it is on some teenage girls ! @-
goes down well with the ladies and I look a LOT younger than my years , though that 's probably more to do with genetics eh
Anyone else get one ?
I was very impressed after last months Batiste fiasco @...
I got the Ciate Nail polish in Kitten Heels Ilamasqua Sheer lipgloss in Explode Nouveau strip lashes Weleda Pomegranate Regenerating Body Oil and Xen @-@ Tan Deep bronze luxe .
What did you all think !
I think that is well worth £ 10 .
Sounds good .
I like the idea of the glossy box and was going to sign up a couple of months ago . But I am worried incase I end up with a load of stuff I just will n't use .
The Xen Tan sounds good !
I want to sign up but I 'm worried I 'll get a load of rubbish too :/
I tried to order a maxi dress online last night from Jane Norman , but when I entered my details , I was told the order had n't gone through .
So I tried inputting my details twice more , to no avail @....
So imagine my horror to see that I 'd been charged three times for an item that had n't gone through ? !
Has anyone been in a similar situation ?
If so , how did you resolve it ?
Any help would be appreciated
I read here somewhere that Jane Norman had gone bust ?
I do n't know if they are just closing the stores or both but I think you should see if they have a number you can call .
I would also call your bank .
I just shaved all my hair off and I 'm feeling good .
I think I might buy a lace front wig tomorrow though .
My hair was badly damaged , it 's something that had to be done , it feels so weird .
I 've always wanted to do this but never had the courage .
Congratulations !
I too would buy a lace front wig if I did it but they 're so damn expensive and time consuming to put on .
I do not know whether to buy a foundation primer - they are very expensive , being almost the same price as the foundation ( for example laura mercier foundation primer ) .
Are they actually worth it ?
Do they make a real difference to your skin , or is it just a marketing ploy ?
Does anyone have any they would recommend ?
Thank you in advance !
They 're definitely worth it , but I do n't wear a primer every day so I suppose I 'm willing to pay a bit more for them .
I only really wear a primer if I 'm going out .
Depends what your skin is like , really .
As a general rule , if your skin is n't totally perfect , or if it 's a bit oily , then a primer is going to make your foundation last a lot longer and look a lot better .
I never used to use it , but in the last few weeks I 've really seen a difference .
Would you get , or do you know anybody who has gotten a Harry Potter tattoo anywhere on their body ?
If you 're confused ( though I can n't see why you would be ) this is what I am talking about
and there are many , many more @...
Now , I am as much of a HP fan @-@ geek as the next person , but I would never dream of getting a huge HP montage on my body .
Imo , while I do love HP and have grown up with it etc. etc. , I know when I am 40 @+ years old I will look back upon the tattoo and wonder what made me decide to get it .
I can understand why people would want to get it done - it 's declaration of their love for HP and stuff , but I personally would n't ever get a Harry Potter tattoo .
Some small quotes / symbols do n't look too bad , but that 's just because I can appreciate the sentiments behind it .
But , while I think they do look pretty cool on other people , I know it is just a phase for me and that 's why I would never have it done .
Any thought or opinions ?
Has anyone actually had one done or is thinking about getting one done ?
It 's your body , up to you what you put on it .
Sure you will get some funny looks and people will judge you .
Kind of like those Twighlight tattoo 's middle aged women get , I find that more disturbing than young people getting HP tattoo 's - they will probably look back when they are 30 / 40 / 50 and remember their childhood .
Yet these people who get the tattoo 's aged 30 @+ already @.... that 's another story .
Yeah , I mean , it 's one thing to proclaim yourself as a fan of Harry Potter , and another thing entirely to parade around as poster for it
Tbh , most of what people get is just for the sake of getting a HP tattoo , not necessarily because of the meaning or symbolism behind it @...
Never @.. They do realise that in 50 @+ years time , they 're still going to have "@ Expecto Patronum @" tattooed on them @..@ ?
Imagine trying to explain that to your children / grandchildren "@ Yes , I did get a tattoo of something from a fiction book @...@ @"
I would never get it myself , but I would definitely love to meet a person who would and be their friend lol @....@ devotion to the next level
I wonder how outdated we will think Harry Potter is 50 years time
So after wearing glasses for about 10 years now , I think its finally time to get contacts .
I would seriously appreciate some advise from people who use contacts already plz !!
So there are these asda ones which seem to be quite cheap :
and in contrast there are these ones that they sell @ vision express :
^^^ are almost double the price .
So my questions are :
a ) Mite sound a bit stupid but would my vision be better with the more expensive ones ?
b ) Are the daily ones better than the weeklies ( as they are cheaper )
c ) Say if i do get weeklies / monthlies , can i sleep / go to the shower with them ?
d ) Finally , which shop / website do you recommend and some buying advise would be really good plz !!
I 'd recommend going to your optician first , you need to know your exact prescription , and whether anything else needs to be looked at , e.g. astigmatism , whether you 'd suit wet ones or drier lenses .
I prefer the daily ones , as there 's no hassle of cleaning and storing them .
You can shower in lenses , but I would n't recommend sleeping in them .
I 've done it a couple of times by accident , and I woke up in pain because they 'd moved around back and sort of folded over under my eyelid .
I personally would n't go for the cheapest ones .
My eyes and my teeth are the only thing I do n't skimp on , because it 's so ridiculously expensive when things go wrong with them that it 's just better to take very good care of them from the start .
Hi all , Essentially , I 'm looking for a "@ cover @-@ up @" ( for lack of a better word ) I can wear daily .
I was wondering is primer alone suitable for this ?
The thing is I do n't like to wear foundation AT ALL ( my face feels weird ) .
With regards to tinted moisturiser , I have Benefit 's tinted moisturiser - it 's okay but I prefer to use it for night 's out or special events .
Somehow it still feels heavy on my face .
Is there a much lighter tined moisturiser out there ?
Any advice or tips for what would be suitable for me to wear and brands ?
I 'd prefer to keep away from foundation if possible .
Thank you !
I know what you said about foundation , but try Body Shop .
it 's really light , then use a powder brush to put a LIGHT dusting of a pressed powder .
if you 're just looking for a blemish cover , rimmel do a blemish stick which covers a multitude of sins .
Make sure you remove any make up with a good non greasy cleanser if you do n't want pizza face
Primer does n't usually give any coverage .
Tinted moisturiser gives a little , but imo does n't do much at all and I do n't like the feel and texture on my skin .
I used a Stila one as it was ok , but slightly greasy
I 'd just get a really light foundation e.g. Givenchy
Do you remember that movie that was based on Nothern Lights by Philip Pullman ?
How come they never made a sequal ?
I was shocked @..@ there was so much hype when it came out @...@ it was so anticipated @...@ x
Well in the series of Philip Pullman books , the next one in the sequence is called The Subtle Knife , I guess they would make a film of that rather than calling it The Golden Compass 2 .
I imagine they would n't make a sequel because the first film was n't very good .
If they even think of calling it "@ The Golden Compass 2 @" , I will go into Genocide Mode .
It pissed me off enough that they change Northern Lights to The Golden Compass for no apparent reason as it is , let alone ****ing up the rest of the trilogy .
The film sold well in Europe but poorly in America , as a lot of religious groups saw the film as anti @-@ christian / religion and so it got a lot of bad press .
The American market is what matters ( afterall , they took the american title of the book , not the original title ) , so all plans for a sequel were canned .
Not to mention that The Golden Compass stripped off all the references to religion it possibly could , but that 's pretty much impossible in the sequels .
How can you kill God without any religious context ?
So if there was bad press for the first film it 'd only get a million times worse by the time the last film came out .
To many fans it 's difficult to see how The Golden Compass could 've even carried the series forward since it left out a lot of the important parts of the Magesterium that is developed in the sequels .
In short , if there is ever to be a Dark Materials Trilogy , it 'll have to be from a British film production company who do n't care what the Bible Belt thinks .
It would 've been nice if someone decided to take it on after the Harry Potter film craze dies down , but since it 's been tried once and failed I think it 's going to be a good few years ( 10 or so ? ) before anyone thinks of touching it again .
Hopefully if it happens they 'll do a Lord of the Rings and film it in one big go rather than wait to see if the box office figures validate a sequel . :/
I do n't either but I can see why he 's doing it .
Cameron is re @-@ releasing Avatar with 6 additional minutes of footage .
People might think it 's a waste of effort , but those 6 minutes will no doubt bring him at least , a few more million $$$ in the bank , just like this 3D crap will for Lucas .
Depends on the film , I thought it was interesting to see Avatar in 3D , but no other movie since has interested me in 3D ( Harry Potter in 3D is a joke )
On the subject of Star Wars , as a massive fan since I was a child this saddens me as I would like the films to be left as they are . ( Saying that I do agreed with the remastering they did for the 20 th anniversary @...@ )
Though being the whore that I am @... I will probably splash the cash to watch Star Wars on the big screen again @...
Hollywood money @-@ grabber cashes in while contributing to destroying new technology - shocker .
I also disagree with people who would say "@ why not ? @" .
Artistic integrity , for instance .
It would be far more appealing to see those films fully remastered in IMAX , rather than a tacky bandwagon jump , and it would still rake in money .
The problem is "@ good @" is still a long way off the kind of images audiences expect .
Without the Force , an after @-@ conversion will never even begin to look good .
If you had six films , which were n't released in their in @-@ universe chronological order originally , would n't you want to change it for any subsequent release ?
The prequels would definitely be improved with 3D , because like Avatar they 're all about spectacle and explosions and the "@ plot @" is really just there to string the spectacle and explosions along for 2 hours .
You can n't tell me you would n't want to see , say , the opening battle in ROTS in 3D ?
That was awesome enough in the cinema anyway , but it could really be enhanced by ILM doing their thang .
I am less optimistic about the core films being convincing in 3D , because as much as I love their visual effects , they were designed 20 years before people even began talking about the possibility of 3D as it has been realised today .
They have held up very well because the story and characters are strong , not because the visual effects are up to much , revolutionary though they were at the time .
Still , this is ILM we 're talking about here , hopefully all six films will come out looking pretty good .
However what I really want is a Blu-ray collection of all six .
Hurry the **** up , George .
Has anyone heard of this film ?
It stars , among others , Natalie Portman , Vincent Cassel , Winona Ryder and Mila Kunis .
It has received some amazing reviews .
It is going to be officially released here in the UK next year in February , but it is going to be shown at the London Film Festival next month .
I read the screenplay a while ago .
A lot of visual potential but a little weak in the storytelling department .
Hopefully Aronofsky has been able to turn it around , though I 'm not really digging the trailer - Mulholland Drive anyone ?
It has Mila Kunis kissing Natalie Portman in one scene .
It 's safe to say the film will attract viewers .
id played a video game called the prince of persia but there is already a film coming out .
For those , who have watched it . what is the feedbacks ?
Planning to see the movie alone
I think it looks AWFUL , personally .
I really can n't stand that actress because she plays the most annoying characters ever , and her character in Prince of Persia really grates in just the trailers .
Not to mention that the script sounds horrendous .
I have n't seen it though @...
I was gonna ask if I was the only one who thought this , but a quick Google search of '@ Sex and the City 2 racist @' answers that question .
Was the film racist ?
Was it intentional , to add to the vapid ignorance of the characters ?
Was it intentional pro @-@ American propaganda ?
Or am I , and many critics , making something out of nothing ?
Thoughts TSR ?
It was kinda insulting to their culture .
But the whole thing was exaggerated for the purpose of enhancing the storyline , e.g. the clash between samantha 's rampant sexuality and the "@ cover up @" stereotype of eastern countries .
I do n't think anybody should get on their high horse about it , people only insult it because it 's sex and the city , nobody gives a **** about stuff like that in other films .
I was watching good will hunting and I realised how some of the things in the film apply to me eg pushing yourself away from people because you 're scared that they 'll find you imperfections etc.
That really got me thinking about my life and what i need to change so if you have any films that have changed you personally or have made you change your outlook on life then plz share .
If you 're thinking , think about something useful and interesting which will get you somewhere @: maths .
I agree there 's more than education .
If you do n't want to think , you could get wasted or do something else etc.
If you 're spending your time thinking , make it useful thinking , that 's all I 'm saying .
The Doom Generation . Saw 1 , i know a lot of people got hooked up on the gore and '@ sickness @' of it , but the whole point of that film was philosophy about life and it did get me thinking for a while .
Actually it led to a lengthy , involved discussion at uni in which someone ended up crying . So definitely good for thinking about life .
And if you 're willing to watch something that is n't a film but still goes in the DVD player , then any of the Bill Hicks stuff
If anyone has n't said The Blind Side yet , then that gets my vote !
I saw the trailer for it and have yet to see the whole thing , but it looks amazing .
And I do n't necessarily think this film is going to make you think hard about life , but @.. I also recommend watching Brick .
It 's good if you 're into a film noir kinda thing .
Can n't believe no @-@ one has mentioned Pursuit of Happyness , the only time I have shed a tear infront of the TV since seeing Tottenham loose the Worthington Cup Final when I was 9 .
Serious stuff , this movie is immense and has affected me more then any other film or tv show .
Scrubs is pretty good as well as providing laugh .
I do n't know if you genuinely believe this or if you are just trying to act the adult .
A life having been spent entirely on academia whether it be maths or anthropology at the cost of missing essential human experiences is the biggest waste of a life imaginable .
Did anyone know ?
IMDB page
The film is classed comedy @-@ drama and is supposedly about the creators and the founding of Facebook .
Facebook has been around for five years now and the question is , does it warrant a film ?
Are the makers hoping every Facebook user . around 200 million globally will watch the film ?
Bit of a stupid idea how film production companies will make a movie about this when there a far better movie scripts out there .
Why not make a film about Digg ?
That 's got a better founding story than Facebook .
Why is Justin Timberlake in it ?
Are they just trying anything to make it big ?
I personally use Facebook and think it 's a useful thing to have , but to be honest why would I want to see a film about it ?
I like seeing comedies , or thrillers , or action films @.. but a film about the founders of Facebook ?
Yeah I heard about that about a year ago when it first went into production .
I 'm really interested to see what comes of it given the cast and ( especially ) David Fincher directing with Aaron Sorkin scripting !!!
The Academy has announced that they will permit ten nominees for the Best Film category instead of the usual five .
The reason behind the change is that the Academy , in the face of falling ratings , wants to attract more popularity to the Oscars .
What do you think of this change ?
What would you do to make the Oscars more popular ?
Or do you think the rise of the internet and etc. will inevitably slowly kill off the oscars ?
I 'm still fuming about Shawshank not getting an Oscar .
Similarly , I am still pissed that Slumdog Millionaire was awarded Best Film last year .
It is a travesty !
It was good no doubt , but the best ?
The judging panel just jumped on the bangwagon surrounding the media hype .
I think The Dark Knight should have won the Best Film award , but they did n't even nominate that film .
Out of the nominated ones , I think Milk was much better than Slumdog Millionaire .
Though Frost / Nixon was pretty good as well .
( The Reader and the Benjamin Button films were crap . )
So in the last week , the new head of Ofsted , Sir Michael Wilshaw , has said @: “@ All teachers should be qualified @” .
What an absolutely preposterous suggestion !
You mean to say that , as citizens of this great nation , our children should be taught by professional people who have gone through the necessary rigmarole to be let loose in our schools ?
How dare we expect that from our education system . And while we 're at it - why stop there ?
Let 's round up our homeless and get them working in our hospitals .
It 'll get them off the streets and straight into promising careers .
Youth unemployment is rife at the moment so let 's get them piloting our aeroplanes .
Heathrow might even get its third runway so we could do with a few more pilots .
I heard overcrowding in jails is a problem too - especially since the rioting last summer .
Why do n't we just convert the miscreants to our side by giving them a uniform and a gun ?
They 're bound to see sense and start making our streets safer instead of causing the trouble .
And lastly , with the Easter holidays coming up , young children will need something to keep them occupied .
Maybe they can try writing for a Sunday tabloid - I hear there are vacancies at The Sun .
You may have sensed my slight sarcastic undertones - although that last suggestion might not be such a bad idea .
Call me naive , but I always assumed that teachers were either qualified or training alongside someone qualified ?
It seems though that any old sod can do it .
Is it any wonder then that the UK 's position in the international league tables has slipped ?
So despite sounding incredibly obvious , Mr Wilshaw seems to have hit the nail on the head .
Problem solved .
I 'm sure it comes as a welcome suggestion to all the fully trained , out @-@ of @-@ work teachers who struggle to get a job .
Not to mention the ones who have jobs and have worked extremely hard to get there .
So until then - if you 're passing by your child 's school , you might want to pop your head around the classroom door .
Just to make sure one of the dinner ladies is n't also teaching maths .
All teachers should be able to teach .
Some piece of paper from a teaching academy does not equate to , by definition , being capable of teaching .
I think all we need to do is think of some teachers we have had to know this .
And at the same time I think we can all think of great teachers who have not had a piece of paper from a teacher training college .
With this notion of qualifications there is an unholy alliance of two groups of people .
The first is the well intended sponsors who think enforcing such rules will improve education by keeping so called unqualified teachers out .
The second is the special interest group , the teachers unions , who want to keep competition out so they want a piece of paper that teachers need to have .
This piece of paper is just another barrier to entry for outsiders and keeps the incumbent teachers safer from competition .
The teachers unions hate competition and they have done a very good job of fending off competition under the guise of the public interest
Fortunately we have things like the Khan Academy now that are going to seriously screw those monopolistic selfish bastards over .
Suck on that educational establishment .
This is a story about BNP on DM
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/arti....html#comments
Unsurprisingly the most liked comments defend the BNP , the rest all praise the BNP , whether it be in a stealthy way or openly ( most of the "@ best rated @" comments openly support the BNP ) .
Majority of the "@ worst rated @" comments on that site criticise the BNP .
I conclude that most of the readers of that paper are BNP sympathisers or supporters .
p.s i would have been for the BNP if they just were n't racist or presented themselves as a "@ Christian party which support Christian values @" , some of their policies e.g. "@ get out of Afghanistan @" , "@ stop being USA 's poodle @" , "@ kick out muslims who do n't integrate @" , "@ eradicate Islamic fundamentalism from britian @" etc. really interest me .
I wish liberals supported the policies i mentioned
While I too think most of their readers are racist , I think for the majority they are more "@ friendly @" racists than "@ BNP @" racists .
By friendly I mean that while they harbour racist views , they are perfectly polite to anyone of any race and do n't go around being openly racist or discriminate against individuals .
Still not a great quality to have , but nowhere near the level of vitriole as the BNP .
I would n't compare them directly to the BNP - most of the readers are white middle class people who find many of the changes in society scary and the Daily Mail gives them stereotypes to blame without using too complicated language .
Whilst it 's an awful paper , comparing its entire readership to some of the monsters in the BNP party is wrong .
Please post in this thread all discussion relating to the recent rise in tension between the UK and Argentina over the issue of the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands .
Argentina is growing quite rapidly compared to the UK , but that is beside the point .
If Argentina were to launch a surprise attack and take the island 's airfields , then Britain would be effectively unable to retaliate due to lack of an aircraft carrier .
Keep pretending everything is fine , though .
Argentina - yes .
Argentina 's armed forces - no .
Argentina launch a surprise attack ?
Well , it would certainly be surprising , not least to the members of their armed forces using the same kit they did in '@ 82 .
They 'd be astonished to learn that they had suddenly discovered the requisite experience , training and equipment to make such a landing possible .
Not to mention we have the southern hemisphere 's most capable attack aircraft stationed on the FIs .
Yes , we 're without an aircraft carrier , meaning we can not retaliate in the same way we did in '@ 82 .
However , this does not mean we can not retaliate .
We 've proven that the Typhoon can fly from Ascension Island to the Falklands .
The RN can still launch a task force that would , if allowed to fight openly , utterly decimate the Argentinian Navy and we retain the ability to launch Tomahawks directly through Ms. Kirchner 's window should we wish .
They would have to be suicidal .
Pretty cool eh ?
What do people think about In @-@ Vitro meat ?
Would you eat it ?
As a matter of interest to the vegetarians and vegans out there , if it was n't mixed with blood , and was simply stem @-@ cell grown , would you eat it
( I can see why vegans might be opposed , but I 'm unsure about vegetarians )
If it benefited my health then I would probably eat it .
Sounds interesting . Though I doubt they 'll be able to replicate the taste of a good bit of beef any time soon .
For fast food places where the meat they use is terrible anyway it should n't affect things much .
It might be the key to the survival of the human race .
How do vegetarians view this ?
All the things they could research to do with stem cells and they come up with this ?
Time is running out for the Chagos Islanders to return home .
These people were illegally removed from their homeland to make way for the US military base on Diego Garcia , leased to the US from the UK for a 50 year period , which could be renewed for a further 20 years in 2016 , if the US so wish .
I 'd urge anyone to watch this video for deeper understanding of this atrocity @:@ @- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oCqqn_uOiY
If you are short of time please take a few minutes to watch this @:@ @- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFLhB_SkMIg
After witnessing these events , I hope us educated TSRians have the view that democracy should prevail , and no one should be forcibly removed from their homes .
Not many know about these atrocities , but help spread the word .
And PLEASE sign this petition to raise awareness , and hopefully ( yes , being very hopeful here ) it will one day be debated in the House of Commons . http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/4685
Thank you .
I signed it .
With all the stuff going with the Falklands , I think this makes the UK seem a bit hypocritical .
I 'll sign the petition if you remove the highlighted part from your post .
It 's inflammatory and a cheap attack on coalition forces .
When actual innocent civilians do die it 's regretable , but we both know that they are n't the intended target .
You clearly put that there to win brownie points with the anti @-@ war crowd despite this issue having nothing at all to do with the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and infact bomber operations out of Diego Garcia completely ceased over five years ago .
I happened to watch a news review on Sky News this morning in which a bunch of journo 's were bleating on that we should n't condemn all the "@ innocent @" and hard working journalists at News International just because a whole bunch of hacks at the Sun were arrested @...
because that would cause untold damage to the whole media industry .
Oh poor them .
This is precsisely , is it not ? , what the whole media has been doing to the banking industry for the last two years or so ?
Total hypocrisy .
It is important to separate the innocent from the guilty in both industries but it 's ironic that the papers have been selling copy by basically tarring all bankers with the same brush and slagging them off mercilessly for years .
Is n't Sky News owned by BSkyB which is owned by News international or something ?
It does n't surprise me though , lets hope Murdoch goes down .
The media condemning bankers is akin to a witch hunt , Stephen Hester was given just a £ 6.5 M bonus in 2010 yet JPMorgan 's top executive was paid $ 21 M that year .
Stephen Hester was employed because of his excellent show of skills after his success in safely defusing the explosive capital @-@ market business of Abbey National .
The media seem to have mixed up the man responsible for the merge with ABN Amro with the man responsible for fixing the failure of RBS .
Moral of the story @: the media will always present news in a way which forwards their views , it 's that simple .
I recently came across two stories , one about a PCSO in the UK who was arrested and sentenced to up to 10 years for having an "@ affair @" with a 12 year old girl , and another where a woman in Utah was given up to 15 years for having sex with a 14 year old boy .
For the sake of argument , lets say a 35 year old woman was having sex with a 14 year old boy and similarly a 35 year old man was having sex with a 14 year old girl .
I can n't think of a good reason why either of these scenarios should be worse than the other , but deep down i seem to feel that the first scenario is n't that serious at all .
In order to give a reason as to why they are different i 'd have to admit a difference in free will between young guys and girls , which is hard to do .
But for some reason it almost seems like the 35 year old man is some sort of predator whereas the 35 year old woman is only misguided .
In keeping with this the 14 year old girl was taken advantage of whereas the 14 year old boy was lucky .
Note that in both cases the sex was consensual , obviously not legally , but in the sense that there was n't any physical compulsion .
So I 'm not saying if a 14 year boy was forcibly touched by a woman it would be ok .
I had a discussion about this with my girlfriend , she thinks both are serious .
I agree , but also seem to have this almost sexist view that the boy was really hurt at all .
What do you guys think ?
Is it sexism or is sex between teenage boys and older woman just fundamentally different ?
I think it seems less serious because 14 @-@ year @-@ old boys talk about having sex with an "@ older woman @" as if it were an achievement .
Whereas to a 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl , if an older man was interested in her she 'd consider him a dirty pervert .
Therefore it seems unlikely that the girl consented , whereas most would believe the boy would be very much up for it .
Well suppose the 14 year old girl felt the guy loved her and wanted to have sex with him .
It still seems that it 's worse because for some reason i 'd think the man had manipulated her in some way whereas in the other case i would n't really feel the boy had been duped .
I think this is n't a good way to think about it but it seems fairly prevalent .
Yes , I saw that .
My point is , people would n't believe that . That 's why it seems worse .
Girl @: "@ But i wanted sex with him ! @" - most would assume she was brainwashed , groomed .
Boy @: "@ But I wanted sex with her ! @" - most would assume that yes , he probably did .
Anyone else think it 's a bit ridiculous that this man actually got arrested for making a monkey gesture ?
It did n't hurt anyone , and whilst it may be offensive to some , surely this is n't an arrestable offence ?
I mean , where 's the line between Un @-@ PC and Illegal ?
No , I do n't think it was ridiculous .
Whilst no one wants to stop banter , the intention of this was clear @: to cause offence .
It was disgraceful and totally unacceptable .
Criminal charges + lifetime ban from all grounds methinks .
I 'm a Liverpool fan and there can be no excuse for this behaviour .
I hope he is banned from football for life ( not just Anfield ) .
I honestly do n't understand racist people .
No he should have been arrested .
I hope the FA ban him from all matches for life , and the courts give him a suspended sentence and some kind of community service .
What I do n't understand is in the film Hot Fuzz , one of the detectives , who was white , called Nick Frost , who is also white , a monkey .
Now , unless I 'm missing something here , I 'm pretty sure Nick Frost is n't black , and monkey means black person , does n't it ?
So what was this detective using the word '@ monkey @' for if it was n't to mean black person ?
I 'm terribly confused .
it 's short but if you do n't want to read it basically a guy in the USA has been arrested for agreeing to meet up with and have sex with a "@ 14 year old girl @" who was actually an undercover cop @...
surely this is entrapment ?
he did n't actually do anything because they basically lead him into the situation ?
sure , it would be a crime if he had actually done this with a 14 year old and something had happened when they met up @...
but the american police have basically created this whole scenario and lead him into it , feeding him along ?
this suggests to me that the police officer was the one who suggested everything @...
coaxed him into it @...
we do n't know the full story but i get the impression that this "@ 14 year old girl @" offered him sex on a plate willingly @....
would that be legal in this country ?
i mean i think it 's wrong that this guy would meet up with a 14 year old with the intent to have sex @...
but fabricating the situation @... you can n't arrest someone for something they have n't done @... it 's just wrong @...
am i the only one who thinks this is messed up ?
From previous similar stories , what usually happens is that the undercover officer behind the screen is extremely passive ( as a normal young innocent teenager would probably be ) and then agrees to meet up with the potential paedophile , if he shows up at the place then he is guilty .
I see nothing wrong with this morally , he knows the girl is 14 and still decides to meet her ( having previously stated his intentions through IM ) .
if that is the case then i understand and agree , it 's just the way the article is written it sounds as if the police officer is doing a lot of the work , and it 's in america so different laws to here .
They do this and it works , there is even a show about it .
To me its fine , if the suspect has to make a choice , ie leave his home and go to a location , then I do n't really care if he is encouraged .
Not that recent but it has gone under the radar for months .
It 's graphic so that is why it is in spoilers .
Strange that youtube keeps it up , but it 's not horrifically graphic like things on liveleak .
Story is basically that they were targeted for refusing to believe in God / Jesus as their saviour .
Guess they did n't get the versions with the execution parts edited out ?
inb4 ''@ you can n't judge all Christians on a remote village in kenya @''
I 'm not , I 'm just posting it .
What planet are you on ?
Go to the gore websites that do n't restrict content and you 'll get so many things about Africa .
The majority of the world may be in the 21 st century but that crap hole is still in the dark ages .
There 's nothing to stop these people what they 're doing , either .
I imagine the town is either under the grip of religion , or too scared to protest simply because of the nature of these punishments .
Another bullet point on the big list of things atheists did n't do .
How Christian of them !
It would be a bit silly to suggest only Christians have done things like this .
What do we think ?
Will this mean a weaker United Kingdom ?
Something that struck me watching a question time debate on this issue was the attitude of some English people , such as the obnoxious Mail journalist on the panel , that Scottish independence was good because then we would n't have to subsidise them for being poor .
He even made some kind of play on words involving the word "@ skint @" .
Scotland probably receives more than its fair share of UK government spending in terms of its share of the population .
I believe this is because it is , on average , poorer than England .
The way some English people sneer at the Scots for being poor and therefore receiving more government spending would n't , I presume , be directed at poor areas of England .
The north , Wales , the south @-@ west , east London and many other areas of the UK get more than their proportional share of spending , because they need it .
I think it 's wrong to resent the Scottish poor for being Scottish , because I 'm sure such complaints would n't be made about poor regions of England .
I was also annoyed by a woman in the audience who said Scotland should be independent ( she was English ) because "@ all countries should be independent @" , including Wales and "@ Ireland @" .
This is such a simplistic view .
Should Yorkshire be independent ?
Should Flanders split from French @-@ speaking Belgium ?
Should Northern Ireland join with the Republic ?
Should Quebec be independent ?
Should the Kurds be independent ?
Should Bavarian , or Basque , or Sicilian , or Catalan , or Bosnian @-@ Serbs , or Cantonese Chinese have independence ?
Loads of places have their own histories , cultures , devolved governments , languages and so on .
Just because Scotland was an independent state 300 years ago , does n't mean it should be today .
The definition of "@ country @" is more complex than that woman 's personal black and white judgements .
Culturally I feel British and I want Britain to stay together .
But I recognise there are convincing political and economic reasons the SNP have for independence and I do n't think Lord Ashdown 's reponse on QT of "@ we 're stronger together @" had enough real substance to it .
I support him , but Unionists need to express in more real terms why we 're stronger together .
Another interesting issue is the advantage to the Tories if Labour @-@ dominated Scotland breaks away .
The Mail guy made this point and Dimbleby immediately quoted numbers prooving that actually Scottish MPs have never been significant in the balance of power in the Commons .
( Take that sensationalist journalist who has n't got their facts straight ! )
And then there 's the issue of timing .
It may well be tactical on the part of the SNP to wait until 2014 , but I think it 's practical too .
Who gets the Trident subs ?
Who gets the armed forces ?
Does Scotland stay in the EU ?
Does it keep the pound ?
What about their oil ?
Do the English have a say ?
These are all in my view huge issues .
It 's the biggest decision in 300 years and it needs to be made slowly I think .
Give the Scots two years to make their minds up , because it 's not as simple as the Westminster government wants to make out .
I do applaud them though for trying to get the legal issues sorted out .
I am so tired of this debate , but I guess it 's going to keep cropping up .
Independence would be worse for both scotland and the rest of the UK .
As Scots are we really so different that we 'd toss aside the political , cultural and economic benefits of the union so that we can massage our own egos and yell "@ FREEDOM ! @" ?
There was an SNP canvaser at my door today , so my mum decided to annoy him , and told him she voted tory @... for which he had no response and got all flustered , then when asked which party she would vote for in the next election she said she did n't vote for a party , she voted for a person , and he got confused , then she said she would n't vote for independence , and he was genuinely surprised and did n't know what to say
The SNP seem to think that just because they won the election it means that the whole country wants independence , when actually they probably won the election because they wanted free prescriptions , free tuition , free care for the elderly etc. while other parties were n't offering as much ( although , it does beg the question of where exactly all this money is coming from ? )
Now for a bit of intentional controversial and completely ignorant '@ tarring with the same brush @' type questions @:
is this what '@ British @' people think ?
I know many people do n't think like this bitch but this is appaling .
should she have her kid taken away from her ?
You see the other '@ British @' woman did n't defend the others but was more concerned with having to take care of her baby that was about to wake up , which means one '@ British @' woman was being racist , and the other '@ British @' woman was just letting it pass , being more worried about something else .
So does that mean that most '@ British @' woman think like this ?
You also have to admit that the lady arguing with the raving bitch had no reason to say '@ We 're here because you do n't work , go find a job @' , that 's wrong and a bit racist within itself .
The like to dislike ration on this video is around 3 @:@ 1 , what does that show ?
what do you think ?
If you allow her to have this opinion is it because you project the same feelings ?
What would be the point in arguing with her ?
The women is so steeped in her own ignorance it would take years to educate her
She 's entitled to her own opinion .
Someone should have just given her a slap just to shut her up
Wow , she 's gonna be REALLY pissed in about 20 years . HAHAHA !
But seriously , if all English / British people were like her @.....@ why would anyone WANT to be English / British .
I actually think she has something wrong with her , whether she is on drugs or drunk .
But she is slurring a lot .
The fact she called Nigeria @... Nygigreeah @.... I think she was half with it @...
No @-@ one in their right mind , starts screaming and swearing like that , with their young child sat on their lap @...
Also , to say most British women think the same , is wrong .
I 'm a British woman and would never dream of acting like that .
You said the one other British lady did not stand up for the others , but @...
1 . She actually did , by telling the loud mouthed cow to shut up .
2 . Although she should n't have to , why do you think she has to get involved ?
Just because she is British ?
3 . Several other people , who were n't British did n't get involved @... does that make them racist too @..@ ?
4 . If I were in that situation , and I had a child with me , I would try my hardest not to get involved , as it would n't be fair on my child .
But if the arguing caused my child to be disturbed , then I would have done the same and got involved .
I agree that what I have watched in this video is sickening , but I disagree with several points you have made .
And I would actually say some of your points are rather racist and offensive to British women .
You may be angry at what you have seen , but that is NO reason to group all British women as racist .
Seems stabbing is becoming as regular as farting , soon there will be so many knives on the streets it will bring back the UK 's steel making to what it was 50 years ago .
Along with tougher sentancing I do n't know what else could be done that would'nt upset the bleeding heart liberals ( no pun intended )
I would rather be stabbed by a childish fool than be harassed by the police on a daily basis .
EDIT @: I will clarify - I would rather take the risk of being stabbed than have my freedom infringed on a regular basis .
did u know statistically ethnic minorites are more than likely to be stopped and searched .
Just saying that this kind of measure to stop and search anyone @- i do n't really see as appropriate .
Recently France decided to ban the burka in public places in the interest of public security .
I both agree and disagree with this statement .
Some women feel the burka empowers them , but other feel trapped by it .
So is it a public security issue or just some anti semetic judgement ?
Is a piece of cloth wrong ? In what way ?
Intimidating or forcing one into dressing a particular way is wrong .
It has been said that if teenages can not wear hoodies in shops as it conceals their identity why should somebody to wear a burka ?
I 'm a Muslim and I did n't agree with much of what he said , but I can n't deny that he was a fantastic orator .
Whether you agree with his views or not , you have to respect the man 's incredible intellect and sharp wit .
I happen to agree with his views on religion and so I must thank him for teaching me an incredble amount of factual knowledge but more importantly , the ability to think critically .
I do n't have any Johnnie Walker so I hope a glass of this JD will suffice .
Thank you for everything Hitch .
You are truly my inspiration .
I was a Hitchens fanboi for a year or so and the fact this is actually really quite upsetting is a testament to just how good his writing is , that he can have such an incredible impact on peoples lives .
Even the guy above who is a glad he is dead has been seduced by the Hitch 's writing in that you either devote yourself to him or hate him above all else .
( That guy is obviously far too stupid to comprehend this though guys so best to just ignore him )
I was n't such a fan of his habit of preaching opinion as truth , then again I 'm not a big fan of rhetoric in general .
Nevertheless , he exercised his right to freedom of speech to the nth degree and gave a lot of people strength in the process .
He will be missed .
A contrarian and freethinker until the end . He left no one untouched @...@ from Mother Teresa to Bill Clinton and Henry Kissinger .
A fantastic orator , extremely well @-@ read and a sharp wit @...
It 's a sad , sad loss .
We need more people that go out of their way to challenge the "@ false refuge of consensus @" he has referred to and warned against seeking .
I 'm coming across so many good quotes from him !
On Reagan @: "@ He 's doing to the country what he can no longer do to his wife . @"
On a TV evangelist @: "@ If you gave him an enema you could bury him in a matchbox . @"
I may have supported his anti @-@ religiousness but , whatever your opinion on it , you have to admire the courage of his convictions .
He only said what he thought was right and , if we had more people around today like that ( namely in politics ) , the world would be a better place .
When I heard about his death this morning my mood completely shifted .
His writings and speeches were such a huge influence on me during those most tumultuous teenage years , the years in which I was "@ tentatively feeling my way into the life of the freethinker @" in the words of Dawkins , and served as a brilliant rebuttal to the dogma I was being fed in Catholic school .
I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hitchens at the "@ Great God Debate @" last year here in Boston and in retrospect , I 'm glad I had that opportunity before his untimely , yet nonetheless inevitable demise .
what are the chances that TM when we wake up in the morning , we switch on to the news and see breaking news that prince Philip has died after overnight heart problems
the guy is in his 90 's
what are the chances he survives this so far look very silm
I pray for his swift recovery and many more years of life and service to the UK and Commonwealth .
Much as I am fond of the Royal Family if he dies I really hope we do n't end up seeing a load of scenes that would not look out of place in North Korea and a Media circus .
It is about time someone reminded all these naive women that no matter what your "@ rights @" are , you still have to take responsibility for your safety or sadly face the consequences .
EDIT @: So @... 87 96 people would risk being raped rather than getting a taxi ?
Well do n't come crying to TSR when you get a reality check .
It 's a sad fact of our society that you have to think ahead all the time to ensure your safety .
It should n't be - you should be able to dance down backalleys naked , drunk at 3 in the morning if you wanted to without anyone trying to cause you harm , but unfortunately there are always those who will take advantage , so you should always watch your drinks , stay within your limit and never ever wander off on your own .
Oh thank Lord , someone talking sense .
Why are we telling women not to get raped instead of telling men not to rape ?
It 's not like getting a taxi is even something everyone can do .
You can n't always afford a taxi ( especially if you 're in London ! ) , you can n't always flag one down , you might not have a working phone on you ( lack of credit , lack of battery ) and you might have a phone but no idea of local taxi numbers .
Does this mean you deserve to be raped ?
Obviously not .
The point here should be '@ if you see a woman walking alone at night , do n't rape her @' as opposed to '@ if you 're a woman , or have any chance of being perceived as one , do n't walk around alone at night @' .
It is easier for men not to rape than women not to be raped .
You just do n't rape .
EDIT @: I seem to have been misconstrued by a couple of people here , so I 'll elaborate .
Women have a responsibility to mitigate the risk of bad things happening to them , like any of us .
I am not saying that women should realistically be able to dance down back alleys naked .
I am saying that the only person with the power to eradicate the risk is the prospective perpetrator .
If a girl is raped , it is not her fault even if she did n't take the adequate measures to mitigate risk , because that risk would have been there irrespective of how careful she may have been .
Rape victims do not have the power to prevent rape .
Only the would @-@ be rapist does .
On that basis , the above interviewer 's handling of the subject seems to me to have been insensitive in the extreme .
Women should not be made to feel bad for having been raped .
Now if these lot rioting and looting were South Asians or , god forbid Muslims , forum would be filled with anti @-@ Multiculturalism rhetoric - where derogative comments about an entire group of people would be acceptable .
Often these people would decry the "@ PC liberal media @" for not calling it out .
So , we all know the crime problems in the black community in London , why are n't you calling it out as an example of Multiculturalism failing ?
You 're probably thinking it , but do n't want to say it .
Heaven forbid , have you become politically correct overnight ?
You clearly have n't been on TSR today .
There are have been numerous threads about the black community etc.
It kind of gets boring after a while .
They are @: I do n't know about TSR , but you should look at the comments on the Telegraph website .
Mind , they do n't need much encouragement .
Why should it be a racial thing .
Most of the past riots have been majorly white , nobody starts banging on about race then and they should n't .
I 've seen a lot of racism today and its unacceptable .
Forget about race
Found this blog earlier which talks about the need to slow population growth .
The blogger puts forward a two child policy as the answer .
Any thoughts ?
The only countries that would be able to implement this already have birth rates below replacement ( or will do soon )
The only area of real population growth in the future is going to be Africa , and I can n't imagine any African states being able to exert this level of control and organisation on their citizens .
Most of the words that come out of his mouth these days seem to be trying to lure catholic votes .
It seems that he knows under the current population changes ( if it continues ) that Ireland will eventually unite .
But how can he possibly '@ end sectarianism @' if members of his party come out with purely bigotory remarks ( such as Ian McMrea 's in the summer time ) ?
How can he possibly change the mind set of unionists who vote for nationalist parties ( SDLP ) purely to keep SF out of a seat ?
How can he change the mindset of hardline nationalists who see SF as traitors and refuse to vote at all ?
It seems that such a beautiful land had been created that it had to be balanced out , so it was sent the most evil of inhabitants to curse the land forever @...
I think it 's a noble aspiration and , yes , unionists need to reach out to Roman Catholics .
There 's nothing ideologically unsound about that - after all , most Roman Catholics in Scotland , England and Wales are Unionists , why should history prevent that from being the case in Northern Ireland ?
I 've not heard his full remarks , just what I garnered from the radio and a couple of short bits in articles , but it really sounded good and - whilst I still can n't bring myself to think of the DUP as decent , mainstream and cross @-@ community - I think it 's a step in the right direction .
It surprised me .
Do n't particularly give a **** .
Never been to NI .
However , if the majority want to keep up a Union with Great Britain then that 's fine .
What 's everyone 's opinions of it ?
Does it bring out English pride ?
Does it look like a piece of junk ?
Tell me .
It really is n't very good looking is it . Even from a distance .
Kinda looks like a rollar coaster with some ugly grey tower going up the middle of it .
Ahh well , good to know tax payers money is being well spent .
At least , I 'm guessing the tax payer payed for this .
nasty tv guys ! yuc , I hate them
If he wants it done , I do n't see what the problem is .
I do n't think there is anything wronge with the except for the name of the program ; "@ Mumifying Alan @"
He agreed to do it .
What 's the problem ?
I do n't see why so many people are against grammar schools , when really segregation happens anyway in comprehensive schools .
The best abled pupils get put into the "@ top @" set and usually get the best teacher in the subject department etc.
If that 's the case then why not just reintroduce grammar schools instead of doing this half hearted attempt at trying to make it look like everything is equal ?
Really , what was the point in the government making me eat lunch in the same room as violent yobo 's anyway and having to watch out for being attacked in the hall way or fireworks snuck in ?
I feel like they were just trying to piss me off , and I kind of am , at them and the socialists who push for this kind of crap .
Are n't they phasing out grammar schools ?
There was one not far from me but it 's just a regular middle / high school now .
Where I 'm from 10 % of children will pass the 11 @+ and get into the grammar school .
The other 90 % are called failures at 11 and sent to an underfunded sink school .
Why is it fair that 10 % of children get 90 % of the funding ?
Grammar schools also do n't allow for children to move up if they start working harder , it 's much easier to move from the bottom set to the top set within a school than it is to move from the comprehensive to the grammar school .
Everyone deserves the chance for a good education not just the lucky 10 % who get into the grammar school based on one exam at the age of 11 .
How will Libya 's oil reserves of 46 @+ billion be divvied up ?
If not the oil atleast a decent portion of Libyas future outward FDI .
Hopefully now we 'll avoid a double dip or prolonged recession .
Get that oil flowing , dammit .
Long live the The Libyan Interim National Council !!
If we wanted oil contracts why would we bother with this ?
We should have just supported Gaddafi and he would have rewarded our support with more oil contracts .
Oh and just because there are reserves it does not mean they are financially viable , plus the TNC could just tell us to **** off like Iraq did .
This is nothing more than a glorified Bay of Pigs
The UK 's Share of loot will be minumum , but BP will make a killing its investments are safe it has avoided a long drawn out civil war .

I was in Guatemala when the CIA was preparing its attack on [ President Arbenz of Guatemala , 1954 ] .
His state had no revenues ; its biggest income maker was United Fruit Company .

We installed a military dictator and there 's been nothing but bloodshed ever since . @" -- Gore Vidal
History repeats it self
I do n't really know what spoils are to be had , Libya only produces 2 % of the world 's oil .
At least the end of the revolution / civil war will make oil cheaper .
It 'll give political spoils to Cameron and Sarkozy , though , as long as the new government do n't cut off umpteen heads in reprisals .
Unless you meant something different , BP went back into profit only a few months after the Gulf of Mexico spill .
Can someone explain the reason behind these riots to me ?
I 'm kinda slow , I have n't been following the news for the past couple of days .
I log into TSR and am greeted by loads of threads about how it 's all kicking off in London ( and a few scuffles in Brum too ) but no explanation how they started then I go to the BBC site to try and get to the bottom of it but still no explanation !
Basically , a guy got shot in London , police claim he was a gangbanger and shot a police officer , local people claim he was innocent .
initial tests reveal he did n't fire a bullet .
Anyways , this killing led to a riot in Tottenham and people realised they could just break down shop windows and take what they want , and burn cars without being held accountable .
So soon enough it spread to all over London @... and now birmingham
So you 're saying there is no reason ?
They just wanted a riot for riot 's sake ?
Basically , a man called Mark Duggan was shot to death on Thursday reportedly by police , a bunch of people staged a peaceful protest and from that people have started using violence , looting and setting buildings on fire , and it 's getting worse because they 're realising that police can n't do anything about it .
The papers have it all wrong .
I live right in the middle of this crap , and I know of the sort of people who 're getting involved , and it really just boils down to some entitled pricks who 've realised that the police will n't stop them from nicking things they want if they do it simultaneously , morality be damned .
That incident might have been the spark , but believe me on this , mate , there is no cause behind it anymore .
People are just taking things because they can .
Most of the trouble around London is copy cat violence of what happened in tottenham where a 29 year old was shot by the police sparking of a protest which gott out of control .
People saw the looting going on and wanted some themselves therefore organising a riot .
So , anyone from Gloucester ?
Riot police , police dogs and police helicopters confirmed .
Sounds like the old college , the old woolworths and a car or 2 are on fire .
Many other shops attacked including Argos , Asda and a couple on Kings Walk .
Bad times
i work in argos and apparently it has n't even been touched it was just the old college and barton street and woolworths .
ive heard that more is going on tonight though in the main town but we 'll just have to see , really pathetic though makes me so angry .
really sad it 's hit gloucester but I 'm not that surprised .
hopefully these idiots will get bored soon enough and there will not be any more damage done !
London is burning and the media are not broadcasting ANYTHING about it .
Twitter is going mental with reports of bomb threats , mass looting , fires etc.
This website is updating every couple of minutes @....
Enfield , Brixton , Chingford , Walthanstow , Dalston @.....@ all being looted @...@ all being set on fire .
A massive Morrisons in chingford has just been set alight ( from twitter ) @....@ this is MENTAL !
EDIT @: People were throwing petrol bombs from bridges onto passing cars on the A10 earlier @....
Have the Police enforced a compulsory MEDIA BLACKOUT ???
The news is being purposely hidden from the world ( to discourage further riots ? ) .
Ive just emailed all the big news agencies making them aware that we know they are hiding this @......
doubt i 'll get a reply , or anything will change on the news .
I think in the middle of all this carnage , everybody needs to take a step back and just hug the internet .
The only omniscient thing I 'm aware that exists .
I was just watching SKY news and the riots are all they were talking about for the past 10 @-@ 15 minutes .
this is completely unjustifiable .
Any sympathy the general public had for the man whose death supposedly spurred on this onslaught of violence is surely being eroded by the minute when thugs are smashing up the businesses , cars and homes of innocent people who had NOTHING TO DO WITH IT .
Was in Brixton for the Splash this afternoon , got violent at 5 o clock or so , very few police considering there were thousands of ppl , also hard to find first aiders WHY DID N'T THE MEDIA REPORT THIS EARLIER ! ?
They focus on shops being burnt late in the evening but not violence at a family @-@ friendly festival etc.
Just wondering about the economic effects of these riots @...
I do n't think that we 'll see any substantive impact in the City unless the riots do actually spread from the periphery to the Docklands , or even the Square Mile itself which I consider very unlikely .
But this is going to his tourism badly .
It 's going to hit tourism really badly .
Tourists are n't going to want to go to a city that 's unsafe where the police can allow mob rule in the streets for three consecutive nights , and understandably so .
this is the message leaving our country to foreign investors @: '@ We , here in England , are mindless barbarians .
If you put your business here , it will not be treated with respect , it may be destroyed , clearly we do n't have the money to buy your products @' .
If i were a foreign investor right now , I 'd be looking elsewhere .
It 's perhaps just the final nail in the coffin .
I 'm not his biggest critic by any means , but this is the most out of touch thing Cameron has said so far IMO .
"@ The whole country wants young people given the opportunity that work experience provides . @"
What a misleading statement .
The country wants unemployed people to have jobs , not be forced to work for nothing .
You would have to be insanely right @-@ wing to describe anyone who thinks people should be paid for work as a Trotskyite .
A lot of people on the right are opposed to the idea of what is effectively a tax @-@ payer funded subsidy to large businesses in the form of free labour .
My take it on this is that it 's a very poor solution to the catch-22 situation hitting most young job @-@ seekers , but that it 's better than the future jobs fund and / or doing nothing .
It 's not forced though , it is voluntary .
Secret tip on how to avoid this '@ slave labour @' @: When they ask if you want to do it , say no .
No it 's not .
It is if you say yes and quit before completion then you lose benefits for 2 weeks ( if an 8 week scheme ) .
One issue is that the actual scheme and the administration of the scheme are not matching up .
The voluntary scheme itself is perfectly fine .
However , something has gone wrong in the way the job centre have been portraying it to some people , making it seem mandatory .
I know they think it is , and the prime minister is elected democratically .
But there is the house of lords and it pretty much feels like a country of '@ lords @' and its like we are still stuck with some middle ages traditions .
what do you think ?
yes , although I 'd like to see a change from first past the post to proportional representation .
Also , to the OP , I 'm pretty sure that there are hardly any hereditary peers left in the house of lords
It absolutely is a democratic country .
We have an elected House of Commons which is sovereign .
People point to the inherited monarchy and the llife peerage as signs of not being democratic , but ignore one significant thing @:
Many other democratic countries worldwide do not elected their Head of State or their Upper House .
For example @: Germany , Italy , Canada , Australia , Japan , Holland , Spain , Belgium , Sweden , Norway , Denmark , Czech Republic , Hungary , Greece and many others do not elect the Head of State .
Likewise , Ireland , Canada , Germany , France , Holland , Jamaica and many others do not elect their Upper House - at least not directly .
As long as the elected portion of the State ( i.e. the House of Commons ) has supreme power , then the democratic imperative is satisfied .
Ironically , having other portions of the State elected will invite deadlock and compromise , and the democratic will of the people will be drowned out in the politicking that will go on .
The Lords increases democracy in the UK - it 's a safeguard .
Firslty the Chamber , although it has party politics , is kept in balance so it is not as partisan as the commons .
Secondly it is a chamber of experts which functions in a largely advisory capacity .
Thirdly these guys are lifers , which means they are able to think past the next election for the good of the country .
I have far more faith in the Lords as it stands than in the FPTP house of commons which leads to barracking by two parties who are becoming increasingly differentiated only by the spelling .
[ Reposting as a replacement for my last post which broke the rules by posting a video only ]
Do you think it might have something to do with the fact that 70 % of the people of these islands do not want this mass immigration yet our government allows million from very different cultures to immigrate to these islands .
We call anyone who says this racist . The U.N. has defined rights for indigenous peoples .
We stand up for the rights of the indigenous Tibetans , Native Americans , Maori and say that Gandhi was a hero for standing up for the rights of the Indian people , but if someone wants to champion the rights of the British indigenous people they are either called racists , people want to have a riot against them and some people would send them to the gas chamber .
Do you think the pressure of this suppression eventually gives way to these racist rants which are becoming so commonplace that youtube is literally filled with dozens of them .
Do you think it is just a co @-@ incidence that some foul mouth racists stand up and deliver some foul mouth speech or do you think that this is symptomatic of the fact that the British people have had enough of immigration and this is the start of revolt .
Black people do n't work
Therefore they can n't afford cars
Therefore they use the bus with the uneducated white chavs
( the first bit is a joke btw , im not a racist = [ )
The rights of the British white population do n't really need championing .
The only reason one would do so would be to legitimise ostracising people from other ethnic backgrounds .
That 's why championing rights for whites is viewed with suspicion , to my mind .
We do n't get .
I 've never seen one .
Where they happen they become viral videos and even make the newspapers .
You might as sensibly ask "@ why do we get so many dogs falling off trampolines at barbecues ? @" or whatever it is that wins this week 's 500 quid on you 've been framed .
The racist people that we have seen on such footage are generally quite poor and therefore take public transport .
They evidently are quite angry that they do n't have much money and therfore take their anger out on other races and point the blame on them @...
I 'd respect what she said if she did n't call me a "@ ****ing foreign ****head @" .
Do n't agree with sending her to jail though , what happened to free speech ?
I guess being unfair neutralises having a fare
It must be the new craze sweeping the nation !
Is there any evidence of a racist rant on an aeroplace yet ?
That 'd be the icing on the cake
because they are uninformed and support the BNP .
Okay , not trolling or anything but i have a question .
Why ? I understand what both the BNP and EDL want in terms of aspirations and goals , ive studied policies and many responses to them .
But from what i 've observed via TSR and many news sources ; the way they 're trying to achieve them , is largely violent EDIT @: specific coverage of EDL , whom seem to make the headlines a little more .
Aggression and hostility is obviously the worst way to go about to get these changes made .
Do n't they realise it ?
I 've seen very little peaceful protests go on , which causes me to question the validity of both the BNP and EDL .
And whether they 're genuinely thinking for the better of this country or they just house people who just want a fight , that have the option to jump on the bandwagon of UK politics . Hence this thread .
I 'm not blaming anyone , im largely trying to remain neutral .
However , riots and fights take two to tango and there is obviously a massive contribution from the opposing party .
But , im just trying to get a bigger picture here .
I 'd like for this to be a calm discussion and an informative thread .
For members and followers of both the EDL and BNP to come and justify their points across so , not just i , but many others can be educated properly on the intentions and the reasoning behind it all . Regards .
First of all , I have no affiliation with the BNP , I find them ridiculous .
But how exactly are they violent ?
I mean , aside from the couple of mental members in the past , I have n't seen much violence coming from BNP members .
Infact , overwhelmingly they seem to be the victims of violence and repression .
As for the EDL . Well , the thing is , they were never set up with specific political aims .
They were set up as an angry response to radical Islam and Islamisation , they are a street group , not a Westminster lobby .
Sadly , some of their demo 's have been marred by violence .
But an aggressive opposition , along with a biased press and press with an agenda make them out to be a lot worse than they are .
That said , they are far from good .
The majority are loutish and do n't have any great intellectual capacity , but that does n't mean you should write them off , or that you should oppose their aims .
People who do n't think the BNP are violent do n't know **** about the history of the BNP .
Yeah they wear suits now , but in the 80 s and early 90 s it was n't a political '@ party @' , it was just a street gang that used to fight with AFA and commit random acts of violence and vandalism against non @-@ whites .
You can n't change that history by appearing on Question Time .
And before anyone storms in with the negs and the '@ that 's just slander where 's the evidence of this @' , Google is your friend , do your own research on the BNP vs AFA and the links between the BNP and the NF , Combat 18 , National Socialist Movement etc. etc. etc.
With the Scottish vote generally being a Labour vote ( 41 of 59 seats ) would losing Scotland give The Conservative party a clear advantage ?
The Conservatives would lose one MP , were as Labour would lose 41 MP 's .
Although Labour would of still won in 2001 without Scotland , The Conservatives would of had a 21 seat majority in the last general election .
As well as this the forthcoming boundary changes will see Labour lose 28 seats compared to 7 for The Conservatives , not to mention union donation caps that would decrease party funding for Labour .
With all the said , and with Conservatives likely to hold a natural majority if Scotland gain independence , would that cause Labour to push further to the right in order to try and steal the Conservative vote and effectively leave behind the working class ?
Personally I do n't think they 'd have much choice .
I am interested in hearing peoples opinions on this .
Unsure tbh , maybe would make the UK slightly more right wing but can n't imagen it becoming majorly right .
Conservatives won a majority of the vote ( but not a majority of the seats , hmm ) in England in 2005 and no doubt many more elections where Labour won in the UK .
Wales are in between .
I wonder how NI would vote if the unionists chose between liblabcon rather then D/UUP
What I find worrying is that you think it is OK for a political party to change its core values and ideals , purely for the sake of gaining power .
Not because they believe in what they are saying .
I 'm not saying that it does n't happen already , but you seem to be implying that it is a totally understandable thing to do ?
Unless I 've misunderstood what you are saying ?
Anyway , my personal opinion is that Labour are n't truly left wing and the Conservatives definitely are n't right wing .
They are as bad as each other .
As a '@ right wing @' person ( *@ cringe @* ) , I sympathise more with some Conservative policies but I do n't really like their leadership .
On the other hand , I detest Labour with a passion .
Good riddance if they loose their foothold in English politics .
Stealing the jobs traditionally done by teenagers . Absolutely disgusting .
Immigration does need to reflect surplus jobs available .
However , you get people like that girl suing the government for making her work in poundland not making things better for anyone .
whilst in some cases this is true half the time these people do the work the rest of the british refuse to do @...
persay street cleaners as a prime example i can n't remember the last time i saw a brit doing it yet people whine about the '@ evil foreigners taking our jobs @'
if they would n't be so anally retentive in what they wished to do .
and on the broader issue thats what you get for joining the EU you win some you loose some , simple .
basically with all this fuss about Scottish Independence in the news I 'm wondering how this bears for people who are n't 100 % '@ pure blooded Scot @' for 7 generations or something .
I dunno why but it just boggles my brain .
If the SNP get their way and crown Salmond as king of his own private domain , who determines who is and is n't Scottish ?
EU work and residency rights no longer apply following independence , and I can see this potential event doing nothing but fuelling xenophobia , racism and nasty nationalism .
Many English people have Scottish relatives or relatives living in Scotland long term , many Scots move down to England , marry English people or have English relatives .
Who decides if they 're Scottish or not ?
People who have lived in Scotland for decades could potentially find themselves aliens in their own homes , potentially considered foreign or '@ not quite native @' .
What about people who consider themselves British living in a British territory suddenly find themselves on the '@ wrong @' side of the border ?
It seems absurd that they should suddenly consider Scotland as somehow '@ foreign @' .
Residents of other EU countries would suddenly find themselves without EU protections either .
Why is the SNP so obsessed with independence when there is no real political or economic mandate for it ?
Surely it has to be for more than some infantile kneejerk obsession with the Brave @-@ heart movie and a unjustified grievance with highly slanted views on history ?
Scotland gains nothing but gets lumped with stupid debt and political fallout , loss of influence and still economically and culturally tied to the rest of the UK as to make an international border seem utterly insane .
The Scots themselves are an amalgamation of different peoples , Picts , Britons , Gaels , Norse and even Anglo @-@ Saxons .
It 's ironic that some Scots take issue with the United Kingdom while ignoring that Scotland was created in much the same fashion .
So TSR , who decides what a Scot in a '@ free @' Scotland is ?
Someone that has a heritage that clearly shows that the family have been in Scotland for a long time they are Scottish obviously although I am sure that someone born there would also be considered Scottish as well ?
the only people who are not Scottish would be those who move there à la not born there or have any previous family who were born in Scotland .
As for who decides that could be tricky although I doubt it will be much of an issue .
I do n't see the situation being any different to the relationship between the UK and Ireland .
It would n't really matter if someone is a Scottish citizen or a UK citizen , because they will have equal rights in both countries .
Right now Irish citizens can freely live in the UK and can vote in general elections and even run for office .
I 'm sure the same thing would happen with Scotland .
It does still raise the question of exactly who can get Scottish citizenship , but it will n't really make any practical difference to people who do n't qualify for it .
Scottish citizenship would probably be open to people living in Scotland on the day it becomes independent , and anyone who has at least one grandparent who was born there , or something like that .
Look at Irish citizenship laws , it would probably end up being quite similar .
Its an interesting question .
I was born in Scotland to parents who were born and raised in England , but then my mothers side ( she 's an Anderson ) has a long history of Scottish ancestry .
I lived there till I was four , but have lived the rest of my life in England .
Am I a Scot ?
I imagine I will be able to apply for Scottish citizenship , but will I be able to vote in a referendum ?
I doubt it .
In recent times and quite a bit more in the past it has always been heavily played on that UK prisoners are some if the most expensive people to keep in the UK .
So I was thinking , why are n't we making the people who have the ability to pay ( ie @- those people who have any sort of savings or credits ) to stay in prison ?
Some prisoners are in prison with large amounts of money in the bank so why are n't we taking money back off of these people to cover the costs involved in keeping them and court costs ?
If people commit the crime people should be willing to do the time and the people who can afford it , should pay for it surely ?
What are other peoples views ?
Yeah man totally agree man they should register to a Student Loan alternative man and then like , sort of pay it off after their time in jail innit , I 'm gonna buy the domain PrisonLoans.co.uk now before anybody else smart steals it
The law should treat everyone equally - You can n't have some people paying and others not .
I agree with you that those that can should be able to pay .
However this also raises the issue that since they are paying money as well as serving their time in jail , their sentence should be reduced .
If this were to happen , would it not be unfair that other prisoners that do not have the means to pay and have committed '@ lesser @' crimes have to serve longer than those that can '@ buy @' their way out of jail , so to speak ?
Taking HIV as an example , the immigrant population has ten times the level of infection of the other 88 % of the UK .
The other diseases are even more extremely biased .
What are your thoughts on this situation ?
Personally I think it 's a very good thing , since our NHS should be working to treat all of the world 's sick people and the more diseased immigrants we have , the more good it can do for them .
Also , having them living among us massively increases the risk of infection for the general population , making for a fair society .
Why should we get to enjoy relatively low risk of serious infections when other parts of the world are in great danger of them ?
Testing immigrants as a condition of entry to the UK would set us back decades and is morally wrong anyway .
Their health status is none of our business .
Yeah it is something that we should keep an eye on but what about people without medical record ?
What do we do with them quarantine them while we wait on test results ?
I 'm surprised that we do n't do this anyway .
Surely , as a matter of common sense , if we get plenty of people from countries where diseases like HIV and TB are rife , it 's best to test for it and treat them upon arrival ?
Both to prevent them spreading it to the rest of the population and also for the welfare of the affected immigrants .
How is that an infringement on human rights @...@ ?
Coming to the UK is a choice .
We already impose conditions on entry , why would one more be wrong ?
The problem is that you 'd have to pay to deport immigrants who fail the tests when they refuse to leave of their own accord .
So , I 've been reading about Scottish independence and I do n't think it 's fair to solely concentrate on Scottish independence and I 'd like to get the overall views of TSR members .
Simple choice , either independence for your home country or to retain membership of the UK .
On the one hand , the union gives us a bigger economy and population , and if it broke up we 'd be less powerful .
On the other hand it 's a good way to get rid of 5 million Labour voters and let the predominantly Conservative England free itself of Scotland 's socialist yoke .
So I 'm not really bothered either way .
So I disagree with the whole Tory ethos , and can n't stand what they 're doing to this country out of sheer idealogy blahblahblah @...
But the reason I really can n't stand Cameron and his current cabinet is that they are constantly trying to pull the wool over the publics eyes .
Whether it 's by saying all those in the public sector who will be striking on Wednesday are selfish , or by Osbourne selflessly wiping the VAT on the X-Factor charity single , conveniently being named live on X Factor infront on millions of viewers .
They ripped Labour apart on the immigration issue in the general election , now look at the mess its in !!
Does anyone care ?
Here 's a link explaining the situation as some of you "@ Righties @" are oblivious to the situation .
Food prices / petrol prices are sky high .
When petrol costs rose when Labour were in government , there was a media frenzy .
Likewise when services had to shut down after a day because of snow , the media launched a full blown attack and everyday people were saying how disgusting it was .
When it snowed under the Tories and services shut for up to a week , noone cared .
Likewise noone was particularly fussed when Osbourne blamed the rubbish economy "@ growth @" on the snow / royal wedding .
Imagine the furore Labour had said such a stupidly false thing .
Sneaky NHS shake @-@ ups .
If any of you have even used the NHS and have lived / travelled abroad for a period of time , you will probably know how lucky we are to have such an amazing health service .
There was absolutely no need to open it up to private firms , and he swore blind in those televised debates that his party would n't touch our NHS .
What a crock .
Youth unemployment the highest its ever been .
It 's been almost 17 months since the coalition has been in now , not 15 months as one of you said , or just 6 months as another one of you said
So blaming Labour for the world recession ( which by the way would have been even worse had the Tories been in gov in the same years ) almost 17 months on where our economy has gone backwards in terms of economic growth from when Labour left office , is ridiculous .
How many more years are you going to use it as an excuse for what is essentially a Tory government dismantling the public sector while it can get away with it .
Public sector workers being singled out to pay more into their pension funds @...
My sister is a primary school teacher and teachers generally hate the tories , before all this pension business came to the surface but because they 're so backward when it comes to education .
She has to pay out of her own wages for all her teaching activites / reading books / teaching supplies and only has a teaching assistant twice a week now because they 've withdrawn so much money from the school budget .
She 's a great teacher so buys all that stuff , whereas a lot of teachers might not bother as to be fair why should they have to spend hundreds a year ? !
Teaching standards are going to fall massively over the next few years .
Why will n't the people of this country wake up and stop allowing Cameron to brainwash them ???
You need not to tell us why , as we already know .
We are like this because of financial issues out of our control and the mess of the last government .
If only Cameron was doing it out of ideology !
I would like a small public sector in this country .
Government spending is actually increasing .
You can hardly call the NHS shake up sneaky .
Public sector pensions will still be much better than private .
How dare we bring Public Sector pensions more into line with the Private sector ?
Just who do we think we are ?
Please , the average life span is ever increasing , it 's put the contributions up , the pensio value down , or work longer .
There are no other choices , the Public sector have been spared this by 13 years of spineless Labour government , but the fact is we can not take this burden on at the expense of the tax payer any longer .
most of those problems you just described are the result of a floundering labour government who let spending go out of control and allowed the NHS to disintegrate .
whilst I agree that D Cameron and the tories are n't doing everything they said they would , they are trying to cut back the welfare state and dismantle some of the ridiculous laws that stop businesses and workers from operating at their highest
also , petrol prices are the result of numerous international economic factors and OPEC price control , the british government can not control that .
OP trying to win brownie points from other clueless students who hate the Conservative party just because .
And failing .
Badly .
Possibly because there 's no money to do anything anymore .
Why ? Because the wonderful Labour party pissed away trillions on trying to create a client state .
Absolutely there are problems in immigration .
This comes the same week that reports ( costing the taxpayer millions ) are finally published , having been commissioned by Labour , but never released due to their findings which basically concluded that Labour made the worst mistakes imaginable on immigration .
Food prices are generally not the domain of the government , and the food prices in the UK are relatively low compared to continental Europe - certainly the Eurozone .
Been to Cyprus recently ?
£ 4 for a packet of butter , anyone ?
Fuel duty has been relatively slow to change since the General Election .
When Labour came to power in 1997 , you could buy petrol at the pump for 49.9 p per litre .
When they left , it was over £ 1.30 .
Labour could n't do enough NHS reorganisation .
Have you seen what an NHS executive earns ?
How about a doctor or nurse that does n't actually have any patients ?
There are a lot of them working for health quangoes set up by Labour .
Very true .
There is a recession on , and the country was on it 's knees thanks to rocket scientist G. Brown .
Damn right .
Why should n't they ?
Why should they be the only people to have gold @-@ plated pensions with no detriment to anyone except the tax payer ?
What about private sector pensions - they 're generally worthless .
Why ? Because they were raped by Gordon Brown .
At a stroke , by taxing dividends he destroyed private pensions , costing countless trillions , but benefiting the treasury a few billion which he whizzed away on social engineering .
No one believes that . Cameron is part of a coalition government , and faces widespread opposition from the likes of you , and hard @-@ liners in his own party .
I would suggest also that large numbers of people in Britain are also resigned to the fact that the country had its back broken during the tenure of Blair and Brown .
except OP explained exactly why they hate the tories @...
Nah I 'd go for sensible people with a realist outlook myself .
Why would you call anybody "@ scum @" for holding a moderate political view ?
Does that post really constitute anything worth replying to , any well thought and argued points ?
It is just the same politically illiterate ramblings you hear from any Tory hating band wagoners , this should be left for the columns of Heat magazine rather than a debate forum .
A study have found there are twice as many mixed race people than reported in the census .
Around 2 % of British people are mixed race .
Coupled with mass immigration , established immigrants having children , and white flight .
The White British will all to soon disappear , just another lost race in the pages of a history book .
Tony Blair defended his immigration policies a couple of months back and I have to say I agree with him .
I 've always viewed immigration 's goal was to try change Britain 's demographics and making it a fairer society in the long run .
IMO we have become a more mulitcultural nation , and and an ethnically richer diverse one at that which was necessary .
Changing the demographics is important for Britain , it 's important for a lot of nations .
To those anti @-@ immigrant nationalists who hate this , look at Obama , probably one of the most popular human beings of all time , if not the most popular ever .
A lot of people like him for his charisma , his charm , his looks , his speeches even , I and many others also like him for his ethnicity ( sorry but I do it 's healthy for the world ) .
Obama 's mixed race background highlights humanities love for mixed race people and our destiny to wanting to become mixed race .
There is no doubt this is the way the world is going .
And Obama as a figure head and his popularity proves that .
Stunning president .
So Tony Blair was right about immigration , and we are becoming more diverse thankfully , like America , because of it .
And maybe one day too we will have our own Obama .
Viva la difference .
Thank you Tony Blair .
Where Tony Blair and his government got it wrong was in underestimating the number who would migrate from the new countries in the EU , and not then providing the resources to support this , for example in English language support in schools .
For non @-@ EU migrants and those seeking to live in the country , the support and resources to enable decisions on their future to be made in a short period of time .
Depends on if you believe Blair did it for electoral reasons or not .
Immigration is good for a society , but opening the floodgates like he did is quite frankly dangerous .
OP spend a year in Luton and tell us all of this .
Besides , it 's funny how you talk about America like it 's improved lately .
It 's going down the toilet @...........@ even more so by the day .
Also , in reality , it 's not mixed at all .
I promise you that Obama is an anomaly .
Most of America is about as mixed race as Roy Chubby Brown .
You mostly get concentrated ghettos with black people and then entire states full of white people .
Obama is n't representative of anything .
As for Blair , he only welcomed all these new people because not him nor his mates have to live with them .
What do they care if you get new Peckhams / Broadwater Farms in other places ?
I think immigration levels are high , and our past pm 's like gordon brown think that talking about high immigration is bigoted .
i have to say i disagree .
my father comes from an immigrant background , and i do n't think am bigoted for wanting to see lower immigration levels .
i also think its stupid that our european friends can immigrate to britian and seek benefits , and denying them that would be against "@ human rights @" @....@ according to the eu court of human rights .
Am i racist and bigoted for these views ?
No , saying that immigration levels are high is an observation and wanting lower immigration levels is what many people want
Everybody knows the rate of immigration is too high but it 's not really what you say , just how you say it .
Your beliefs do n't stem from believing your race is superior , or that immigrants or other races are inferior , but '@ your racism @' is arguable in regards to prejudice , discrimination and antagonism ( also part of racism ) .
Not saying that you are , I am saying that is open to question and has grounds depending on how you go about these beliefs .
For example , if you made an unjust distinction of someone because they are an immigrant , not quite sure if that would make you a fully fledged racist , but it certainly would be discrimination .
Basically there is a thin line .
Sucks but life is sometimes politically correct , but you have to learn to deal with it because you never know when you 're the one going to be on the other side of the spectrum .
OK , so I am still learning about how the free market / global energy supply system works so please correct me if I am wrong , but here is my suggestion ;
All state services including social housing , libraries , hospitals , schools , prisons etc. should be powered by British energy only and everything the state uses ( construction materials , food etc. ) should be British produced , grown and maintained by a British workforce .
Alongside this , we open up the private sector to imports and freedom of choice , luxuries etc.
The private sector can do pretty much whatever it wants but the state must be able to support itself with or without the boom and bust of the private sector .
People who choose to live on benefits ( rely on the state ) will only have access to British resources also .
( British grown ) food will be provided for survival as will housing and energy but ( imported ) luxuries will not be available to those dependent on the state .
If people desire luxury , then they must work for it .
The idea being that the state pays ( modest ) salaries for its workers who consume British energy ( retrieving this money through taxes from British workers ) and British food / materials .
This would effectively create a system which circulated resources within the country rather than it being channelled out into the hands of Russian billionaires .
The energy will be supplied through wind turbines positioned offshore around the British isles which are maintained by idle military personnel .
Further , a production workforce will be employed by the State in factories to produce said materials .
Edit @: Why is everyone negging me ?
I 'm trying to offer a solution to a problem .
And this will be paid for with what ?
So no library books from non @-@ British authors ?
I think that demonstrates how quickly this idea is a fail .
Also not too sure why you do n't think pensioners should be allowed to buy themselves a bottle of champagne for their 80 th birthday party either .
That sounds like an awful lot of Government intervention .
Your ideas are crazy and would mean the death of the free market .
You have to let the free market work .
And then consider the burden on the tax payer @....
The market should decide ,
if the people want British goods they will buy British goods .
If they want foreign goods they will buy those instead ,
it certainly is n't in the States interest to increase costs substantially by going exclusively for British goods of all kinds ,
they should go for the cheapest best quality goods instead .
This is not a dictatorship .
You can not force suppliers to sell products for no profit
( they would simply move abroad where they can sell 100 % of their product at a profit ) .
Thorium is a viable nuclear alternative and one which frankly we should already be adopting .
There are aspects of self reliance which would be good but on the whole protectionism is not a good long term policy to follow .
I 've really never understood this mentality .
Here 's the crucial fact @: we import more FROM other EU member states than we export TO them .
Any tariffs they impose would hurt French , German , Spanish and Italian businesses more than it would hurt us .
The EU is fundamentally committed ( this is stated in one of its treaties I believe ) to fostering good relations and free trade with non @-@ members , especially those which maintain high standards of human rights and democracy ( now ai n't that ironic ) .
So if we left the EU , we could negotiate free trade agreements individually with the union and its members ; we could join / remain in the EEC ; or we could join the EFTA ( EEC @-@ lite ) .
We 'd have a range of options , all of which would keep our trade with Europe strong and healthy .
Will politicians in Germany and France want to stop Brits from buying up their countries @' BMWs , Mercs , Audis , VWs , Peugeots , Renaults , and so on ?
I very highly doubt it - not a vote @-@ winner .
As well as maintaining our trade levels , if we left the EU we could save the several billion pounds we donate to the EU each year , reduce immigration to more viable levels , and shun some of the more overbearing aspects of EU bureaucracy , all of which would benefit our economy substantially .
Oh , and I forgot to mention that it 's predicted that the EU 's share of world trade and prosperity is going to massively decline over the coming decades .
So why is everyone terrified of leaving because of trade ?
The EU probably deflects as much trade as it creates .
Because we are part of the EU we trade more with members of the EU , such as Germany , France , Italy , Spain , Portugal , Greece and Ireland because we have a common market .
However what this means is that we trade less with nations like China , Brazil , India , Japan and America .
I am not convinced we want to attatch ourselves to the overly indebted nations of Europe .
I would rather trade with the up and coming emerging economies .
However as part of the EU you do get the appreciable benefit of free trade within the EU area .
However it is starting to look like the members of the monetary union are going to try and exploit the common market member ones eg . The Tobin Tax .
In the very long run I think being outside of Europe and trading with the emerging economies , which will eventually become the big economies , is wiser .
I agree with the Europhiles that it 's important to trade and work together so the people of Europe can collectively raise their standard of living , it 's just that the EU has proven to be a corrupt power hungry entity that has a socialist doctrine at it 's core so it 's not an ideal long term trading partner .
It 'd be like relying on the USSR to provide you with economic stability .
I need reasons for why drugs should NOT be legalised , any help please ?
I 'm for drug legalisation .
The Government has absolutely no right to say what I can and can n't do with my body , as well as what I put in it .
We should be helping those who use drugs , not punishing them .
You could make the point that by making drugs legal and creating potentially a bigger market for their use that food crops could be replaced in developing countries for drug crops much like the increase of demand for bio fuel has done , thus increasing food prices making impoverished people even poorer and increasing inflation of food products which are bad for most consumers so drugs actually have a massive impact on none drug users !
The problem with both of us is that neither of us specified which drugs we are talking about .
Some drugs such as heroin are clearly awful - I certainly hope that you agree it is addictive and does harm others .
Some drugs have much less of a negative effect on the individual and other people around them .
Cannabis being mentally addictive is still addiction .
The addiction may very well be weaker .
I agree , the government should help drug addicts .
I believe that drug addicts should be forced to enrol on some sort of a program which is created to help them whether that would be in prison or otherwise .
( I also believe that smoking should be banned )
I think we 're all for legalizing drugs until you meet the poor guys / gals who are n't from middle class / higher class families and can n't afford rehab ( this coming from a lower @-@ middle class guy ) who are sleeping on the streets in the winter in the snow before eventually dying .
Drugs are n't good and are n't necessary , and ruin tons of peoples lives .
I have used drugs in the past and will probably do so sometime in the future , but it should n't be legalized .
Everybody seems to forget about you know , the large amount of money spent in hospitals treating drug users .
Besides this , saying the government should n't tell us what to do , well I hate every single politician , but using that argument just makes people sound like children .
Perhaps reform , with more punishment on drug dealers would be good .
If you want to get philosophical , I will tell you what I believe to be the most detrimental effect of any recreational drug .
Recreational drugs cause euphoria .
Hence , drugs are an artificial substitute for a natural incentive that has evolved to motivate our species to do what necessary for it 's survival .
There are natural states in which humans can experience these sensations .
We come with built in mechanisms which produce these affects when appropriate .
This is ultimately why your body may produce some version of these chemicals naturally .
These chemical reactions are usually triggered by behaviors which are positive in terms of species propagation .
An example of such behaviors would be accomplishing a task , or making a personal connection with another .
Recreational drugs are a waste because it is counter productive to nature , to society , and to your personal growth to have access to undeserved bliss .
If we were capable of producing a drug which induced intense euphoria , with no side effects , no adverse health risks , and was infinitely available , It would be catastrophic to our society .
It is easy for drug users to delude themselves into believing that the health risks are minimal when they are partying and having so much fun .
The biggest delusion of all is the one that most overlook .
We are not naturally meant to feel that good without achieving something to improve our existence .
I already know the kinds of responses I 'm going to get to this thread , almost by definition , because as far as I can tell you can split the English public into two groups when it comes to Scottish independence ; a majority who do n't care above some vague notion that Scotland probably costs them money , and a very vocal swivel eyed unionist minority for whom Scottish independence marks the beginning of the end of their pseudo @-@ colonial ambitions .
So I want to ask that crowd , and I already know they are going to be chomping at the bit to just click reply already , but I specifically want to know what it is you want out of the Union ; I do n't want to hear about how Scotland would be worse off somehow etc. etc. just why you want the UK to remain the UK and not split .
Does it actually boil down to anything other than a perceived loss of prestige , the final nail in the coffin of Britannia ?
I 'm English .
I think it would be nice if we stayed unionised and strong .
But really , if Scotland really wants out , then let them **** off , because the whole point in such a union ( IMO ) is that it 's voluntary and agreeable to all parties .
Scotland should remain as part of the union .
It serves nobody to break up one of the world 's oldest nation states .
All of the SNP 's gripes can be solved by greater localisation - not by a pointless break up .
As for '@ English people @' - the attitude generally seems to be one of '@ let the scots decide , but I would be sad to see the United Kingdom dismantled . @'
Personally , I think it 's best to let the Scots have their independence within 5 years , but before such plans are published we should drill for all the oil they have and use it to pay off our debts .
After that if there are any remaining debts they should be given around 1 / 3 of it .
As I was writing a post in another topic earlier about Russia and their right to be a superpower , my mind rambled a bit and I started to wonder if Great Britain can ever become a political superpower on the international stage again .
90 years ago , the British Empire was accountable for approximately 25 % of the entire worlds population , and Britain had control of 25 % of the worlds landmass , therefore being able to completely dictate trade routes and international relations .
A lot has changed in 90 years , clearly .
In 2008 , Great Britian controls very little in the way of overseas territories , and have a population of only 58,000,000 residents , many having moved into the UK from other countries .
We also seem to be losing the ability to defend ourselves politically , being subservient to the United States in their quest to capture resources , and being a part of the European Union , often have to accept group decisions that the country does not agree with or benefit from in any way .
So , with all this in mind , can Britain ever become a superpower again if desired ?
I know that we clearly will never compete with China in terms of population , but is there any way to maximise the economic power of the nation in order to compete in terms of financial position and ability to develop and expand faster and more sustainably than other nations ?
Also , what would be the positives and negatives for the general population if it ever were to happen ?
You could make a case for the UK being a financial superpower , we punch way above our weight politically and we have one of the best trained militaries in the world .
Yet superpower in the old sense of the word , basically being a colonial or military superpower , is something I think is out of our reach for very obvious and in my opinion desirable reasons .
The best way the UK can stay on the world stage is doing what it does now , being pretty much the top in the service industries .
The British Empire was probably the greatest the world has ever known .
It was also one of the most brutal and morally abhorrent .
I think monopolistic power tends to corrupt and is almost invariably abused .
Anyway , we are a stable , wealthy country .
Why do you care , Ian ?
I hope this is n't some jingoist nonsense .
The fact is , it is n't going to happen .
Yes it can .
Whether it does become one remains to be seen .
The next superpowers will be those who win the energy war .
That is those who develop the best and most efficient renewable / readily accessible power source and are completely self sufficient on it .
Possibly creating a surplus .
In all honesty , I really see the EU being the next World Super Power in the next 70 years .
I mean we are getting closer and closer to becoming a single '@ state @' .
I mean most of Europe has the same currency , laws and you do n't need a visa to travel between each country .
The numerous train operating companies in Britain make our rail system confusing .
They encourage high fares so that they can make profit , but do very little to invest in the network ultimatly leaving Britain with the highest rail fares in Europe with one of the poorest services .
Meanwhile , in other European countries such as France and Germany , the rail network is nationalised .
They benefit from low fares and quaility services composed of many '@ high speed @' routes .
Privatisation in Britain was supposed to encourage competition and therefore drive drown fares but I do n't see how competition on the railways works as each company usually has a monopoly on the route they serve
( Eg . If you want to go from Nottingham to London you can only use the East midlands Trains )
So , do you think that we should re @-@ nationalise the railways and base the network on the French @-@ German model of low fares and high quality ? I certainly do !
We can n't afford it right now .
Anyway if we had the money yes . Not this idiotic subsidized monopoly
What happened to that company that walked away from one of it 's franchises a couple years back ?
I remember the government ( Lord Adonis I think ) said it was going to be punished , did anything ever happen ?
Financially it may not be viable at present , but nationalisation ought to be a long term aim .
Privatising the railways was arguably the worst thing the Tories did .
In the meantime we need more regulation , especially with regards to fares , which are disgracefully high .
I support deregulation , and I am completely opposed to nationalisation .
in a time of economic downturn , you want to nationalise the rail network so the public sector ( who is already faced with billions of pounds worth of cuts ) has to finance the entire network , including maintenance , investment and subsidies ? No thanks !
Deregulation or Privatisation FTW @.....@ or even just how it is right now @....@ our rail network is n't that bad to be brutally honest ,
it gets you from A to B , sure there might be a few delays before you get to C , but you 'll get there in the end
...@ and the Tories are hopping mad over it !
How long can Cameron keep smoothing the ruffled feathers of his party ?
Will this be the straw that breaks the coalition 's back ?
Cleggy Weggy claims a lot of things .
It was n't really a Lib Dem victory , the general population was wholly against it from the beginning .
Nick should stick to weeping to Celine Dion .
So we 've all been hearing a lot about super @-@ injunctions being littered all over the news , although one thing has struck me , that applies in almost all other European countries apart from us @: The defendant is always anonymous until proven guilty .
I think that until the defendant is proven to be guilty , they should be completely anonymous , to prevent false arrests getting out into public and denting one 's reputation , as it is almost a form of defamation .
I do n't think it 's fair that cases are so publicized , and should only be so open if the defendant does n't mind .
It is weird how people proven to be innocent are still hated because of the accused crime , like the stigma of being called a paedophile even though it can literally happen to anyone and everyone .
Would help if the media made a big thing about them being innocent , but most people are stupid generally , else this problem would not exist .
If you look at that Joanna Yeates case , everyone had decided that landlord was guilty up to the point where people hated him and the media was slaughtering him .
Turns out he was innocent .
Not that the media owed him an apology or anything
FPTP or AV ?
Supporters of each claim that the other will benefit "@ x-treemists like da BNP @" , but they can n't both be right .
Can we find out here which voting system will benefit ( increase the power enjoyed by ) small , "@ extreme @" parties like the BNP and Greens , with an explanation ?
Do n't vote for AV because you think it will help one party more than another .
Vote for AV because you think it will be more fair . If AV results in more BNP MPs , because more people in our country support the BNP , I think that 's fair enough .
We live in a democracy after all , people should be allowed to vote for who they like and everyone 's vote should count .
Honestly I hate these freaking '@ Vote AV and the Tories will n't get in ! @' arguments , they 're so idiotic and not even true .
UK peoples @- Who else here thinks we should use the Single Transferable Vote as our electoral system ?
For those of you who do n't know what it is , I think STV is the main truly proportional system of electing MPs .
Candidates are numbered similar to AV , but constituencies are multi @-@ member so seats are allocated based on numbers of votes .
It 's the system used in EU elections .
I 'm one of the few British tories who thinks we should use it , but what do you think ?
STV would be my ideal electoral system .
The whole constituency link issue would be less important if we had more localised politics .
I was sympathetic to STV , but then it seems that in the recent Irish elections it 's just as vulnerable to disproportionalities as FPTP @...
Stv is far and above the most fair system in my opinion .
Representative + constituency link maintained .
What more could you ask for !
Invade Libya .
Think about it , what does Britain have that there is a potentially lucrative demand for ?
The answer , a well trained and heavily equipped military , which although short on numbers at the moment , could easily be bolstered in a very short period of time .
The Libyan rebels are crying out for assistance in overthrowing Gadaffi , so I say we make them an offer .
We 'll send an army of 100,000 troops to take Tripoli , and in return they will provide us with a promise of a fee - say , 30 % of all Libyan oil revenue for the next 15 years .
So not only will the invasion create British jobs , take people off the streets , provide invaluable battle @-@ field experience and be self @-@ financing @....@ it could actually be PROFIT MAKING !
A 30 % stake of ALL Libyan oil revenue over the next 15 years could be worth tens of billions of pounds .
It 's just a shame that with Clegg and the Lib Dems in a position of power , this left @-@ wing / anti @-@ military coalition would never go for it .
BP and such British companies are already in Libya and have been for years .
Drastic action like you suggest will just form a beacon for all extremeists in Africa to come to Libya to kill British citizens
100,000 troops There 's barely that many soldiers and officers in the entire army , most of whom are not frontline but rather logistics , intelligence , engineering personnel and so forth .
You 'd have to start giving sailors and aircrew rifles and combat gear .
We are doing enough as it is in Libya , anything further we can do must be humanitarian ( supplying medical and food supplies to Misrata , for example ) or logistical ( supplying training and weapons to the rebels in Ajdabiya so they stop sucking )
OP I think you underestimate how long it would take to train and equip 100,000 soldiers then all the logistics and other such things that an army would need .
If you are going to do it well I 'd say at least 5 to 10 years .
Especially if you are doing it to the standard of the British army .
I 'm not insulting politicians here ; I 'm defending them for once .
I always feel that people are impossible to please when it comes to how politicians appear in public .
Take the TV debates for example @: everyone hated Dave 's "@ down with the people @" and "@ I met a black man the other day @...@ @" act , but at the same time , had he remained aloof and failed to engage with anyone , he would have aggravated another group of people , and been called a toff even more .
Another example is that recent departure lounge picture , which everyone decried as a fake .
Again , it 's a lose lose situation @: some say it was staged publicity , which is bad ; others say it was genuine , but the whole holiday was a pathetic attempt to pretend that "@ we 're all in it together @" ; others still would doubtless complain if Dave flew off first class to a five star resort instead of using Ryanair to go to some four star place in Spain ( or wherever it was ) .
This is n't unique to the Tories , those were just the examples which sprang to mind .
Sometimes I find satire a bit annoying , because it means that politicians can never seem to do anything right .
I wish people would keep the debate on policies and ability / desire to deliver them , not who 's a toff or who 's flying which airline or holidaying in which place , or using certain mannerisms to respond to questions .
Just my random ranting two cents .
Yep , I feel extremely sympathetic to politicians .
I know quite a few personally and almost all of them are actually , dispite the hype , really good people !
They get held to a higher standard than almost anyone else , seem loathed for doing a very , very tough job and often for doing what people claim they want them to do @...
Well , you know , I doubt whether some of these "@ hard working @" politicians would last very long if they had to work on a building site carrying bricks or steel gurders for 10 hours a day , or even work a 9 @-@ 5 carrying heavy frozen meat produce from one cage to another 7 days a week .
I 'm sick and tired of this wishy washy social justice nonsense that the Lib Dems are inflicting on Her Majesty 's Government .
What the country needs is a Tory government .
A proper Tory government that will not be afraid to stand up for free markets , hard work , Britishness , Israel and our military .
I hope to God the AV referendum returns a big fat NO so that this horrid left wing coalition can be returned to the dust and we can finally get on with real , Tory leadership ( thanks to First Past The Post , of course ) .
What has first past the post got to do with having a Tory government ?
The problem for the Tories is n't the electoral system its that they do n't have enough widespread support in the electorate .
We had first past the post last time , the country was on its knees and we had had 13 years of Labour government , with Labour 's popularity at rock bottom .
But still the Tories did n't have enough support to get a majority under FPTP .
Now the Tories are facing the unpopularity of government and Labour are ahead on the opinion polls .
The Lib Dem vote will collapse but I bet more of their vote goes to Labour / Greens than it does the Tories .
I think the UK was a broadly Tory nation up till the 1990 s but since then it has turned against them , they had their lowest ever days in the mid @-@ late 1990 s and early 2000 s , even since they 've had an upturn on the back of a Labour government running into problems , they 've not been able to build a broad base of support in the country like MacMillan or Thatcher did .
The tories did n't get a majority because labour fixed the boundries .
Labour got a majority in 2005 with 9.6 million votes but the tories come short in 2010 despite having 1.1 million more votes than this .
Some analyst reckon the tories needed just another 15,000 votes to get that majority .
I would have voted based on what I thought was best for the country .
If I honestly thought Labour could solve the problem , despite all my problems with them , I would have voted Labour .
But that is n't the case .
But a lot of Labour voters I know / have met , have told me that they vote Labour because '@ Tories only care about the rich @' .
And that is it , you ask them why they think that and @....@ nothing .
Or another common reason '@ Tories will take away EMA and give the moeny to the rich @' .
Well yes , they took away EMA , but EMA was a stupid system anyway , unfair and put in place by the Labour government to try and make unemployment figures look better .
Most Labour voters I know in real life voted for them either out of ignorance and views inherited from their parents / peers .
Or because they wanted their pocket directly lined .
Now , I know this is n't the case for all Labour voters , hell there are some intelligent ones on TSR , who vote for Labour for decent reasons , and though I disagree I respect them for that .
I just feel that Labour get a lot of votes from the reverse @-@ snob working class in areas like mine .
So they can quite literally do anything , and people will still vote for them over the Tories .
I 'm fairly right wing , but I do n't think a full on tory government is what anyone wants .
This is a centrist country and the government should reflect that .
I 'd like it if we elected very socially liberal governments all the time ( to the point of legalising and taxing all narcotics ) , but I know that will n't happen .
I 'd like withdrawl from the EU , but that will n't happen .
Politics in most democratic countries does usually hover around the centre .
Apart from the US , but that 's a cultural thing really .
As a Labour Party supporter , I disagree with the cuts that the Coalition Government are currently making .
They are going too far , too fast .
Their policy of contractionary fiscal policy creates a substantial risk of the UK slipping back into recession , which means consumer confidence will begin to fall even further , as people will be more likely to save , which leads to less money being pumped into the economy , ie . a fall in aggregate demand .
With current levels of unemployment very high , job losses will be the consequence of these harsh , unnecessary cuts through the Coalition Government 's contractionary fiscal policy .
On the other hand , Labour 's policy of expansionary fiscal policy means that although the budget deficit will increase , a significant number of jobs will be created , aggregate demand will increase , which means an increase in consumer confidence , therefore household income will increase , which may result in taxpayers moving into a higher tax band , which leads to an increase in Government revenue from taxation .
If we carry on with the current rate of cuts , we will reverse to the 1980 's , making the poorest poorer , and the richest richer , same old Tories !
Cuts need to be made at a steady pace , with the budget deficit dealt with once the economy is full steam ahead .
All views , opinions and thoughts are more than welcome
Definitely pro @-@ cuts , even though the wife lost her job , she still agrees with the cuts , it 's for the good of the country as a whole
Pro cuts for me to because if you invest in the public sector like labour would it means your getting growth based on debt which does n't work then we 'll eventually have the same problem again and run out of other peoples money to spend .
The only way you can have growth is by private investment .
I 'm not against the cuts per se .
I 'm just against the reforms that are going to cost as much to implement as they save and are done for ideological rather than financial reasons .
Cuts are more or less inevitable , even if I do n't necessarily agree with what , when , where , how and why .
It makes me cringe that the government are cutting funding for the British people , and yet somehow fund the military to rain clusters of bombs over foreign people !
to be honest as much as everyone dislikes them I do n't see any other political parties putting forward a decent proposal
this country literally has no money and is in huge amounts of debt
I 'm against the increase in Uni fees though , on the whole I do realise that University fees DO have to increase , but trebling them within the space of a year is far too much
I apologise in advance if there is something similar to this thread , but this is a topic that has interested me recently and would just like to hear your views on the matter .
I 'm a British Pakistani , born and brought up in London , however I would say I am very much in touch with my roots and my views lean more towards the traditional and conservative side .
Recently I watched a documentary by Saira Khan '@ Do n't tell my Mother I am in Pakistan @' , made a few years ago , yet a very interesting watch .
I have been on holiday to Pakistan a fair amount of times , and have traveled throughout the country , so I thought I had a pretty accurate idea of the country as a whole and it 's people .
However , after watching the documentary and various other programs and films on Pakistan I am absolutely shocked .
I may be wrong when I say this , but was Pakistan not founded as a Muslim state , yet only 64 years on and I do n't think the country matches the vision it was initially created with .
It seems that the higher class are obsessed with imitating and adopting western culture , in a sense it boosts their superiority complex .
I actually find it shocking , that most families who moved to England in the 60 's like my grandfather have managed to maintain that cultural pride and certain traditions that have been lost among certain groups of people in Pakistan .
Drinking is a common practice with the upper class society and personally I find it quite upsetting , it seems as if Pakistan is moving in the opposite direction @- the rich becoming more obsessed with western culture and the less well off being neglected further .
Also whilst I 'm on this topic , has anyone seen the film '@ Slackistan @' and what were your views ?
Thank for reading my thoughts !
Liberalization is moving in the OPPOSITE direction ?
Personally , any nation 's judiciary system that is in anyway influenced by objective morality scriptures and superstition has no place in the 21 st century .
While I can understand your sentiment that is undesirable for tradition to be dismantled , ever since the fall of the wall in 1989 , Liberal democratic values have spread ( End of History , Fukuyama , 1992 ) and that does not preclude ( just yet ) the sovereign states whom are conformed to Islamic teachings as their rule of law .
Western culture gives people individuality and lets them choose whether to follow conservatism or choose their own destiny and the right to enjoy any liberties they desire ( as long as it does n't harm anybody else ) .
I think it is the right direction that Western culture ( unforced ) is spreading , it gives a common ground for different cultures to interact , promotes tolerance and allows people to pick their own way of life .
I do n't see that being a problem .
And that 's a bad thing why ?
Westernisation = Progress .
Imitating the most developed countries in the world is n't really a bad thing .
Pakistan was founded on the basis that Muslims felt their interests would not be guarded by a Hindu government , not as some spiritual Muslim homeland .
As it is , I 'd hardly say Pakistan is '@ Western @' , what with it 's blasphemy laws , it 's constant conflict with India , conservative populace , tacit funding and support for various Islamist organisations .
I think rather than worrying about the populace , worry about yourself .
Who are you to judge people if they wish to drink alcohol , or watch Western TV ?
Also , as you bemoan the West . It 's worth remembering you would n't have had a country without us
I simply do n't get why Iran is such a huge threat .
They are merely retaliating to whatever our politicians throw at them !
"@ If Iran changes course , abandons its nuclear weapons ambitions , and lives up to its international obligations , it will be welcomed back into the community of nations . @" @...
As a weak country with no big weapons to defend its people @..
Yeh right , they 're so on board with that !
All the huge countries that are bullying Iran into submission right now with sanctions and what not have nuclear weapons ?
How on earth is this fair ?
All the sanctions is AFFECTING ORDINARY IRANIANS !
Soaring food prices / Fuel @...
Why is the world doing nothing ? !
Do we want Iran to become the next North Korea ?
This is totally Unacceptable !
Not to mention the meddling we have been doing inside Iran for the past 100 years or so @... installing the shah @.. overthrowing democratic governments @...
Hey Israel , how about you assassinate some more Iranian scientists ?
Absolutely degrading behaviour by the west , no wonder they hate us !
Because they have a pretty crazy guy at the head of their government - who 's developing nuclear weapons .
Not to mention the grudge they have against the west .
they have a bad history of blowing things / people they do n't like up @...
negs , quaint @... are you all disputing irans known history of terrorism or are you all morons ?
Because Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is a maniac .
What kind of history do the US have then ?
Do n't remember Iran starting a war the last @..@ lets say 2500 years ?
that was a tongue in cheek remark i was n't being entirely serious .
Largely rhetoric to lay the groundwork to get support for the war .
This was n't done properly before going to war in Iraq and we had people opposed to it from the start , also going in with mixed messages '@ its about WMD and a bit about regime change @' looked bad when there were n't any WMD there .
So we need to go in from the start saying with Iran it 's about regime change , Ahmedinijad is bad , he does n't respect womens rights or whatever otherwise you will have the same situation if we say its about nuclear weapons and then go to war and do n't find any nuclear weapons .
I can understand the argument that nuclear proliferation is bad and any of these states having nuclear weapons is not desirable as it just leads to proliferation in the region , but that argument should have been used against Pakistan and Israel getting nukes .
People say Iran having nukes is a risk because terrorists might be able to get hold of nuclear material @...
well hello @...@ Pakistan has them .
Remember when we went in to take out Bin Laden we could n't tell the Pakistani government for fear that Bin Laden would have been tipped off and escaped @...
that hardly fills me with confidence that they should be allowed to have nuclear weapons .
The problem with these '@ resolutions @' targeting Iran is that everyone can see the hypocrisy , its a case of our allies can have nukes but others can n't .
A much better resolution would have been a hard resolution on non proliferation and disarmament in the region , which meant India and Pakistan had to disarm and Israel had to disarm , and any moves by any country in the region towards getting nuclear weapons would be met by international air strikes .
I could definitely support that as a non proliferation treaty .
I 've heard stories of Pakistanis , Indians , Bengalis , Filipinos , Iranians and Arabs with African roots being racially abused in places like Saudi Arabia , UAE , Bahrain and so on @...
Are you a non @-@ Arab minority living in the Middle @-@ East , or do you know someone who did ?
Do you feel that the problem of racism is a big or a small one in comparison to places like America ( the southern states in particular ) ?
It 's not so much racist , as it is '@ classist @' .
People from India , Pakistan , and so on often work as maids , drivers , etc. in the middle east .
They do n't abuse you because you 're a certain skin color , they abuse you because they think you 're some servant that barely makes any money and should be grateful for being there .
Yes , there is racism in some Arab countries in the Middle East .
If you are from Pakistan , India , Bangladesh or any country that is n't very rich then you are mostly treated like crap .
However , if you are British , or from the US or any other rich European country then they treat you really well .
Indians in particular are treated badly , there are Indian maids and they are often hit by the house wife if they for example make a small mistake or sometimes they are hit with no reason .
I have relatives who live in one of those rich middle eastern countries and as far as I know they told me that some of them whilst at School have experienced racisms from children for example one of them a girl was called black and ugly and that her hair is bad but the teachers do n't do anything about it , they are racist themselves .
I have to admit I am really quite worried about Russia @..
In the mainstream media and popular consciousness the big doomsday scenarios mainly centre around Iran and China , obviously both of those are grossly misrepresented , the idea of a US @-@ Chinese war for example is objectively absurd and no serious commentators pay it any attention , it 's really just a propaganda tool and an exciting subject for video games .
The situation in Iran has the ability to cause a lot of misery in the middle east but again , Iranian leaders are really quite self aware , they know what they are doing , and there is near enough no risk to the world at large even if they do acquire nuclear weapons of them actually using them , although we as simple peasants obviously need to believe that and go along with our governments because if Iran does become a nuclear power then it will have a lot more independence and influence in the region and that obviously can n't be tolerated .
Anyway , Russia , it seems to me , is the real potential doomsday scenario here .
Almost all the conditions of wiemar Germany are present ; economic downturn , unemployment , a recent history of loss of empire , rising nationalism and xenophobia .
And just like Germany there is a hard turn to the far right by the country 's middle classes and the rise of egomaniacal leaders who are already undermining what little democracy there has been in Russia .
There are even Putin youth leagues harassing opponents above the law .
You have the ultra nationalist and deeply racist cossack tribes , highly militant , extremely aggressive and becoming more and more mobilised , convinced that the time has come for mother Russia and that x , y and z ethnic / religion / political groups are responsible for the loss of Russia 's glory and therefore must be eliminated .
Just like Germany was , Russia still is a major military power , a nuclear one , and with enormous economic potential .
Honestly when you think about it it really does look just @.. terrifying .
Am I missing something here ?
Can anyone explain further or recommend some reading ?
Yes , Russia does have huge problems with neo @-@ nazi ideology ( which is kind of ironic given the history of Russia ) .
It 's military is pretty brutal as well - see Chechnya .
Russia regularly interferes in it 's neighbours ( such as the Ukraine and the invasion of Georgia when it became too western ) , but I do n't think it has much power beyond that , that is n't to say that they would n't if they could .
But they are hemmed in by China , Europe and the United States .
There is a lot of bitterness about how ex @-@ USSR states have become part of '@ The West @' ( like Poland and Estonia for example ) .
What specifically are you concerned about ?
It is n't going to invade Europe again if that 's what you are concerned about .
I mean they helped the invasion of Afghanistan and Putin asked to join NATO .
Their closest "@ Western @" allies are France and Italy ( and they are close ) .
Russia is n't really that close to any major powers .
I disagree with this , at least not without huge structural changes .
It has terrible future demographics ( with no available fix through immigration ) and is totally dependent on exporting oil and gas - as well as being run by corrupt oligarchs ( who make Western corporatism look non @-@ corrupt and benevolent ) .
I think Russia is pretty neutral about most international affairs now , so I do n't see the big worry .
Russia has been reduced to nothing but a peripheral country that condemns whatever resolution the West puts forward .
The Russian government is pretty bad , but their opposition is worse .
The leader of the second largest party in Russia , the communist party , wants Russia to be "@ re @-@ Stalinised @" .
The third largest party , the Liberal Democrats , is pretty nutty too .
First off , a disclaimer of sorts , these are my opinions based on news reports and a little research around the topic so I apologise if my facts are wrong or inaccurate .
Like the title says I welcome thoughts either on my opinion , or on the matter in question .
Anyone who follows the news will have heard in amidst all the "@ EU crisis @" there is an issue growing between the west and the middle east .
Specifically Iran and its attempt at a nuclear program , where Iran hopes to gain nuclear power for peaceful purposes ( Iran 's statement ) .
The US and EU however believe that Iran are using this nuclear program to develop and obtain nuclear weapons claiming they have "@ information suggesting Iran had carried out tests relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device @" .
Due to this the US and EU have imposed sanctions on Iran involving limits on the oil bought from Iran which in turn decreases their economy and other sanctions of similar consequences .
Right now that that 's done I can state my opinion , please correct anything I have put that is wrong !
My opinion in short is this , the US and EU have no right to impose sanctions on Iran and to deter their nuclear program .
HOWEVER , I am very opposed to Iran gaining nuclear weapons and threatening WW3 and in fact I am opposed to any country having nuclear weapons .
The only argument the US and EU have is that Iran is not a stable country at the moment and a unstable country should n't be able to kill millions at the touch of a button .
However for them to tell another country what they can n't have , when they have nuclear weapons themselves is nothing except hypocrisy .
From Iran 's point of view , one could argue that our governments are unstable with new leaders every 4 years with differing opinions and views .
What right do we have to dictate what another country can and can not do .
I think that 's the essence of my argument , and I accept that the "@ Iran instability @" is a big part of the sanctions .
Thank you for reading and I hope I 'm not completely ignorant here !
Why do countries not have a right to tell others what to do ?
People tell each other what to do all day every day , why should countries be exempt ?
Of course , Iran has every right to say "@ no @" , but then those other countries have every right to refuse to trade with them .
Though I do n't believe we should have nuclear weapons either - it 's not hypocritical as such .
Having a new leader every 4 years does n't make a country unstable ( otherwise Irans single leader would be highly stable ) .
Most countries who have nuclear weapons now can be trusted not to abuse them - Iran can not .
Regardless , I personally do n't think world security should be held back just because someone is worried about being a bit hypocritical .
I believe that the only reason why American gun sights have been trained on Iran is because of their decision to switch from petro @-@ dollars ( American ) to the gold standard or something similar .
This would would have a detrimental effect on the American economy , or practically any economy that relies on the dollar as a currency and as a result , the already weak American economy would lose it 's leading place .
All the other aspects , nuclear power and oppressive regimes are just a side issue .
This was demonstrated time and time again when Saddam switched to Euros in 2000 and Gaddafi wanted to switch to the gold standard before he was toppled .
The EU also wanted something similar and I do n't know what happened to that .
There is still no evidence against Iran .
The IAEA have been in many times .
All we have is suspicions .
Also the IAEA publishing the names of all Iraqi nuclear scientists is rather sinister .
They very well knew this is like gold dust to Israel and America ie assassination targets . Impartiality ?
I think not .
The hypocrisy argument gets nowhere , but most fail to understand the double standards suggest an ulterior motive , at the least a lack in credibility of the West .
Israel has illegally obtained and continues to have a nuclear arsenal , not to mention the innumerable UN violations against it 's neighbours , yet it is metaphorically Scot free to do as it pleases .
It 's like they are playing Poker @: The Political leadership of Israel / US and Iran seem to me more likely to "@ go all in @" rather than back down and fold or negotiate .
I think it 's a while off yet .
Iran is having a decent time trading with the East , and trying to stick two fingers up to the West .
Neither side want 's to jepordise their economic security by engaging in what will be a costly and deadly military action .
I think the only problems will come if and when Iran stop allowing Nuclear inspections , or when the UN / NATO / the West decide that there is a high probability that Iran are near realisation of weaponised nulcear material .
I personally find Russia 's behaviour at the UN this week to be absolutely disgusting .
Apparently they 're threatening to veto a resolution on Syria if it does not explicitly rule out foreign military intervention .
The text has already been '@ watered down @' to omit the demand that Assad step down , yet again to appease the Kremlin .
Every day nearly 100 innocent civilians are being massacred by the fascist government in Syria ( at a far quicker rate than those Palestinians who have died at the hands of Israel ) .
But where are the demonstrations ?
Where are the '@ blood for oil @' and '@ victory to the intifada @' morons ?
Where are the hysterical students comparing Medvedev to Hitler and Assad to an SS commandant ?
Where are the Russian flags being displayed next to swastikas ?
Where is Michael Moore 's film condemning these indiscriminate murders ?
Where 's the public outcry about Russian veto and unilateralism ( a criticism routinely employed - rightly - against the United States when it vetoes resolutions on Israeli aggression ) ?
So many have been killed that the UN has given up trying to count casualties , and yet we have a clique of barbarians and mafia crooks in Moscow holding the world hostage over this issue .
Russia is renovating a military base in Syria , has arms deals worth billions , infrastructure and energy deals .
Russian oil , gas and steel companies have substantial interests in Syria including an Arab gas pipeline , gas processing plant , deal with national syrian oil company and oil exploration there .
Russia wants stability and a friendly regime to ensure the security of their interests , so they back Assad .
That 's Russia for you .
Nevertheless , Assad would be lucky if he survived this year .
It 's a similar situation to Libya .
The rebels need help with the big military targets , but when it comes to ground operations , they are more than capable of handling the situation .
If you wish to understand Russia 's reasoning , know its national interest .
In this case arms contracts worth $ 4 Billion is a national interest .
No way are they going to let that go down the drain if they can do something about it .
Nor are they willing to lose face by openly supporting the Syrian regime .
They will just exercise their UN privileges and keep sneaking the promised weapons into Syria one way or the other and keep cashing in on the opportunity .
Personally , I do n't think they would start WW3 if Iran is attacked , because they have more to lose , and they 'd probably just do things like supply weapons etc. @..
Any one else have an opinion on this ?
If WW3 does break out , we know we can go to Greenland or Egypt
Good to see China backing the Iranians .
whilst i think the prospect of ww3 is a slight bit of over kill the chinese do have a point in that the west is in no position to meddle in iranian affairs least of all at this stage
China hey dude , sup
Iran hows it goin bro
China yeh just u no how u like killin your own peeps just like I do ?
Iran yeh lol
China lets like hang out together n attack ppl who try to stop us killin our peeps
Iran sure thing bro
China would eventually lose .
Anyone , watching any of the GOP republican presidential debates , as you can see the media pathetic effort for pretending that Ron Paul does n't exist .
Ron Paul is right on every level but the mainstream media does not want him to get as much talk time as other Puppets such as Rick Santo rum and Mitt Romney
I 'm in .
He is amazing , the only person who can take the USA forward .
However , he appears to be losing steam as a result of the timing of Florida and S. Carolina .
Do you realise that Ron Paul would disapprove of the video in your sig vehemently ?
Probably , but then due to the fact it 's got more space , the USA does n't have the same problem with Muslims as Europe does .
Also , the USA 's biggest problem at the moment is an economic one .
People are saying this everywhere now and the consequences are unknow .
Could this really happen ?
Only if Ron Paul does n't become president then there will be war .
The U.S. has n't the capacity to commit to a full-scale war with Iran at present if one keeps in mind its quite significant pre @-@ existing commitments , the state of the economy , and the strength of Iran 's defensive capability - targeted strike ( s ) seems more likely , or perhaps greater action by Israel , but I doubt that .
Why is the United Kingdom allowing Asma Assad and her three children to remain in the UK ?
I know she was born and raised in London , but do you think that the UK is as anti @-@ Assad as it claims ?
One word , three letters , two vowels , one consonant .
OIL
But there are sanctions on oil exports ?
I know this sounds too nice but it 's maybe because a persons family should not suffer for the '@ crimes @' of an individual .
She 's British I think .
We 've been hearing a lot in the news about Iran and its threats to shut the Straight of Hormuz , and how western countries ( e.g. the UK , the USA and France ) , but how are the countries around the straight reacting to the threat ?
as I can n't seem to find anything on how countries such as Oman , Iraq the UAE are reacting .
Wild speculation is welcome here
This is backwards .
It 's not a threat , it 's a response to the threats of others , e.g. "@ Attack us and we 'll close the Strait of Hormuz @" .
There is nothing for other countries to respond to .
They are the would @-@ be aggressors .
Unfortunately most TSR'rs are too brainwashed to see that .
Just so stupid .
Iran 's the only one with the balls to stand up to Israel / USA .
IF they fall due to the surrounding countries going against them , then they 'll continue remaining sheeps and it will n't be long till they 're toppled themselves .
I support Saudi 's arming up though , as I do for all Muslim nations , weapons may be useful in future .
The Islamic Republic only exists in part because of Israel .
Israel sold almost one billion $ of arms to the Islamic Republic during the Iran @-@ Iraq war and provided loads of military aid ( this was while Israel was apparently a supposed sworn enemy ) , training and even helpfully removed Iraq 's nuclear capacity in Operation Opera ; where if Saddam had developed nuclear weaponry he would have undoubtedly used against Iran .
Did you know that there was a camp just outside Tehran of Israeli tacticians aiding Khomeini and co against Iraq for the whole of the conflict with Iraq ?
The Islamic Republic owes an awful lot to Israel - it enabled it to survive against Saddam and continue the war with Iraq ( by continuing the war this enabled it to solidify it 's position by killing thousands and thousands of Iranian democrats and other members of the opposition - as well as terrorising the population ) .
Do n't forget that Iran supported America when they invaded Afghanistan and Iraq as well .
These are the facts @:
In the west , it is threatened by Iraq , in which US forces are still present
In the east , Afghanistan has at least 100,000 US troops alone
South @-@ east , Pakistan which has nuclear arms , corrupt officials and is a US ally
All around are arab countries with friendly ties to the US who keep rallying for the '@ head to be cut off the snake @'
North @-@ west , Turkey , Nato ally
North @-@ east contains refuelling stations for US millitary vehicles in Turkmenistan
who is really being threatened here ?
Sorry to inform you @: THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE WOULD GO TO WAR :P
As nice as it would be for countries like the USA and the UK to be over there to help , the truth is we would n't interfere if it was n't for the oil and other economic and political gains .
If they do restrict the Straight it will will cause a massive decrease in the amount of oil to the west ( 40 % of imported oil comes from the straight according to a figure I saw on the news ) , and our economy would greatly suffer @...
We would in that situation definitely cause a big commotion .
I highly doubt there would be a WW3 , but I do know for certain that the big countries and supper powers would go to war due to globalisation and economic links .
In Australia the poor quality of local broadcaster 's international news seems to have completely baffled the general population as to exactly what is going on , the coverage is utterly appealing to be honest and regularly confuses their nuclear programs and their attempts to blockade the Straits of Homuz .
Politically the general gist of things is that the current Labor government is stuck between sucking up to the United States and therefore getting embroiled in any potential conflict ( HMAS Parramatta is presently off Somalia under NATO command and could get drafted in should military action commence ) and the fact that the Greens now have control over them through their control of the Senate and their single lower house seat ( Hung Parliaments for you ) and of course are very anti @-@ war , anti @-@ NATO and anti @-@ ANZUS .
The ultimate result will be down to who is Prime Minister when such a situation occurs , according to the unions they intend to fire Gillard next month and replace her with Kevin Rudd yet again who is extremely pro @-@ China and less aligned with the United States although he will probably suck up to Obama as well .
The opposition will attempt to counter any potential for entering the war with statements such as "@ They 'll be Iranian Boatpeople @" causing national panic and further hatred of innocent refugees potentially leading to an early election and a Coalition ( Liberal @-@ Nationals ) government being formed who will support the war to a degree but otherwise will be to focused on Nauru which is the main aim of their entire foreign policy .
Over these past two years , I have noticed an increasing amount of anti @-@ Iranian news reports which have culminated in the recent attacks on the British Embassy with both countries expelling our respective Diplomats .
It now seems certain to me that within the next decade the U.K. and U.S.A among others will be involved in a fully fledged war against Iran .
Throughout history , the expelling of Diplomats has usually meant one thing and when this is coupled with the Arab Spring alongside general unrest for a long period in Iran , it seems inevitable we are heading towards another war .
As a general question , I would like to ask others to see what you think ?
Are we going to war , what can we do to avoid this and just in general for people to air their opinions on another war in the Middle East .
P.S. Just to clarify I am neither anti nor pro war , this is just a launch pad for a discussion .
Given the Israeli mentality I would say we will see them strike Iran .
Would't be shocked if they used nukes either tbh
That is a big claim ,
it would quite an amazing escalation if Israel used nuclear bombs on Iran .
I know , however Israel is going to know that if they strike Iran Iran will hit back .
Conventional weapons may not even be able to hit some of the fortified facilities either .
The idea of a single debilitating strike on Iran that will stop it ever being able to strike back is going to be very very tempting for Israel .
And depending on which way the American election goes American support may not be forthcoming if someone like Ron Paul gets elected
If they have / get nukes , no one 's invading Iran .
I personally think it would be cool , Israel might have to think twice before carrying out major bombings in Palastine etc.
There will always be that deterrant if Iran gets nukes .
Of course not but the question is fast becoming not will Israel strike but when and how .
A conventional strike on Iran is going to raise massive geopolitical consequences too . Including huge damage to the world economy and the possible destruction of Israel .
bit of a novice at economics but i was wondering , after kim jong @-@ il 's death why are the stock markets in asia / korea falling ;
are they anticipating something ? thanks
This will hopefully herald the end of socialism as we know it as people will realise that it is doomed to fail .
Just leads to insecurity in markets
you look at koreas neighbours China , South Korea etc. all major players in the world economy .
Im sure some dirty bankers have vested interests also .
But whose to say it was Kim Jong bringing down the markets .
With the primaries quickly approaching I thought it would be a good idea to have a thread on everything related to the 2012 election .
Who do people think will be the Republican nominee ?
Who do you think has the best chance of beating Obama ?
For me it seems that it is going to come down to a two @-@ way race for the nomination between Romney and Gingrich .
I can n't see any of the others getting the nomination .
Romney probably has a better chance than Gingrich of beating Obama .
There is now a poll .
If you do n't think any of the candidates can beat Obama then that goes under '@ other @' .
I personally would like to see Ron Paul be the nominee , but Backmouth probably has better chance of becoming a TSR Mod than this happening .
The republicans will probably go with Romney over Newt Gingrich .
It is a shame that scandal has hit Herman Cain because he had promise .
I am an Independent voter and my opinion is that who ever the Republican nominee is , they probably will n't be willing to do what 's necessary for the U.S. economy if elected .
If Obama is reelected he definitely will n't be willing to do what 's necessary for the economy .
I hope most other independents feel the same .
I 'd be happy with anyone but Obama who wants nothing less than our economy 's complete demise and is clearly anti @-@ Israel .
What does everybody think about the possibility of going to war with Iran ?
The US are making moves encouraging a very likely chance of war !
Do you think it will happen ?
Do you think it should happen ? Discuss @...
Mark my words . No other country will attack Iran except for Israel , with perhaps military support in terms of intelligence from the US / UK .
The UK does not have the means to carry out an attack on Iran . -
Forget the fact that the US / UK / NATO would never get the support from the international community to carry out an attack .
Israel ? They can do what they want .
What are people views on the current British occupation of Ireland .
Should it be freed from their imperialist grip etc. @...@ ?
What do you 's think of the current armed struggle ?
Was the war involving the IRA and INLA a success or a failure ?
And what are your views on those trying to establish a socialist republic in Ireland ( not the Guerilla Army 's ) ?
I really do n't think anyone in Britain cares much about Ireland .
I do n't think many people really understand why you insist on murdering each other either .
Ireland needs to overcome its grip of alcohol .
First , Britain no longer occupies the southen 26 states .
The idea of an armed struggle is preposterous , even to strong nationalists the idea of free healthcare , a stronger economy and less corrupt politics makes war even more ridiculous .
Currently those in the IRA are terrorists fighting a pointless war they 'll never win .
Socialism is in itself a fair theory for government , yet no country has established a socialist republic that is superior to the current democracy
The law of return gives Jewish people and those who half Jewish on their mother 's side the right to become Israeli citizens .
This is a ridiculous sexist and racist law that nations around the world should oppose .
Britain is now refusing to give aid to countries who discriminate against gays , we must now do the same to sexist and racist nations .
A number of states world wide have similar discrimination , however we deem Israel as a modernised civilized society .
Israel must set an example to these less developed nation by scraping this outrageous policy .
What if the government said all people of European heritage are free to become British citizens would we call them racist ?
Israel is a Jewish state , specifically .
Created for the Jewish people , does n't seem that odd that if you 're Jewish you 're allowed citizenship .
Judaism is passed through the mother ( a Jewish mother makes you a full blooded Jew , not half jewish ) that 's how Judaims works .
So it 's not that sexist per se it simply follows the Jewish laws of inheritance .
Other religions are passed soley through the father , are they sexist too ?
Making Aaliyah is n't exactly a small step @...
And as soon as you 're a citizen if you 're under 40 ( 35 for women ) you will have to join the IDF .
I just do n't think it 's that shocking or appalling .
Also , they have a very good refugee policy - they 'll take pretty much anyone who is fleeing for safety .
Countries are free to make up Immigration rules as they please .
It happens here in the U.K. and around the world .
For example if my Grandfather was a British Citizen born in the U.K. , who then moved and married a none British Citizen , and they then had my mother outside of the U.k. , my mother would still be eligible for citizenship .
However if my mother then married a non Brit and gave birth to me outside of U.K. I would no longer be eligible for citizenship as Citizenship rights only extend one generation in the Uk .
However if it were Ireland instead of the U.k. I would still be eligible for Citizenship if my Grandfather was Irish .
So I would be Irish if my Grandfather was Irish , but I would not be British if my Grandfather was British .
Is this discriminatory ? Yes @..
but immigration laws by their very nature are discriminatory , that is their whole purpose , to discriminate who is and who is n't allowed into a country .
All nations have them and they all tend to be different ( which is normal considering different nations have different cultures , traditions and customs ) , it just so happens that in Israel the requirement is that your mother is / was Jewish , it is different to requirments in other countries but it is no less valid .
Reading the newspaper today you may have seen an article regarding a teenager called Tariq Aziz .
He was part of a scheme organised to document the effect of drone strikes , he was given a camera .
On his way to his aunts house he and his 12 year old cousin were slaughtered by an illegal cia drone strike .
What the **** is wrong with America ?
Who will go to ****ing court because of this ?
No @-@ one cos its America , and they are clearly above the law because they have money .
How the **** can America complain about Palestinian home @-@ made rockets when they 're using drones without a care in teh world ?
Why does America have the right to ****ing attack anywhere its want without any accountability ?
It 's not a bloody cod killstreak .
Why when they kill civillians do they have the cheek , to quote the Times article to say '@ they 're has been no collateral damage in drone attacks @' when according to the Times again there are pictures of incinerated young children ?
Now do you understand why many people , especially muslims have a gripe against the Americans ?
At least most muslims are sane , unlike the American government who just can n't seem to stop committing terrorist acts .
I 'm sorry for the swearing , I 'm not one to usually swear , but the CIA et al are a joke .
Why the negs ?
The killing of this and several other innocents is okay ?
If Iran sent a little drone to America and did the samething , what would the ramifcations be ?
what would the outcry be like @..@ ?
OP I suggest that you watch the documentary ''@ Secret Pakistan @'' on BBC iPlayer and then come back to argue .
This supposed ally of the USA is training and preparing INNOCENT Afghan children who are too young to understand Islam properly to go into a busy Afghan bazaar to blow up INNOCENT Afghan civilians .
This is what Pakistan deserves for funding lunatic Islamic rebels since the the 1960 s against any Afghan government that has existed .
It is the price paid for the two million dead Afghans during the Soviet occupation and the civil war which Porkistan funded .
The truth is , every time these drones hit , they kill maybe 10 % terrorists ( at max ) and 90 % civilians .
Each of this civilians is a real human with real emotion , not just a statistic .
For instance , a 10 year old kid sees their father blown to pieces , you expect them to love the Americans ?
They become radicalised and ready to murder Americans at any cost .
America strategically targets civilians so they have a reason to stay there due to further radicalisation of youth .
I tried to watch the program "@ Secret Pakistan @" but the question i kept asking was why ?
In the first ten - twenty minutes they never explained why Pakistan would want to double cross .
Now do n't get me wrong there will be people within the intellilgence who are double crossing and have a secret agenda .
But to the highest level as a whole why would the government want such destabilisation from all angles .
The president is corrupt and money hungry but i would say that there are plenty of easier ways for him to do that if he so pleases and putting the country into turmoil and him in a terrible light would surely be foolish .
And re the whole drone thingn I really struggle to understand how they can be justified at all .
When lots of people in USA died in 2001 they felt angry , agrieved and wwant revenge .
To do this they went on a long war resulting in thousands of deaths and also did not take regard for countries @' sovereignty .
Now again a lot if not the majority of deaths are not caused by the USA directly but a significantly large number are therefore it is still a valid point to raise .
I would love to know how a usa citizen would react if bombs were dropped on their home towns by a foreign country .
I 'm sure they would be happy to forget it and want no justice .
You know what I love ?
All these people saying ohh , you are creating the terrorism !
Well , we would n't be doing anytyhing were it not for the terrorists in the first place .
And what cause have they ?
They did n't like American foireign policy .
So instead of going to a parliment meeting , they went to armory and decided to blow **** up and kill innocents .
You want someone to blame for the deaths of civilians in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan , look no further than Muslim Terrorists .
I think most people are looking at this , again , without an objective analysis of the situation .
Ever since the intervention in Afghanistan and drone attacks of Pakistan , can anyone give me a successful attack by al-Qaeda on the West since the intervention ?
Some people should know better that the United States and her allies are not on some mission to kill innocent civilians , quite the contrary .
Most of the contributions in this topic have failed to recognize that Islamic fundamentalists have been operating in Pakistan and are the root cause of terrorism in that area .
In 2006 , Pakistan saw 657 terrorist attacks leaving 907 people dead .
In 2007 , Pakistan saw 1,503 terrorist attacks , resulting in 3,448 casualties .
In 2008 , Pakistan saw 2,148 terrorists attacks , resulting in 2,267 casualties .
In 2009 , Pakistan saw 2,586 terrorist attacks , that resulted in 3,021 fatalities .
Terrorist attacks have killed over 35,000 people .
If we compare this to figure of civilian casualties ( which I will go into ) it is quite a healthy ratio as of the 1658 to 2597 killed , 385 were thought to be civilians , in contrast of the Taliban / al-Qaeda 's operations to kill civilians .
Interestingly , the number of terror attacks in Pakistan dropped which can prove to be conclusive evidence of the effect on al-Qaeda and Taliban leadership and their effective operational capability that is decreasing .
One can logically say these drone attacks are working , which is reported on both sides if you look at the current fragmentation of al-Qaeda and asscoatied jihadist sects leadership operating on the Afghan @-@ Pakistani border .
From a strategy perspective , in 2009 and 2010 , air drones were equipped with new missiles called Small Smart Weapon ( SSW ) or typically known as '@ Scorpion . @'
These missiles have increased accuracy and expanded surveillance , including the use of small , unarmed surveillance drones to pinpoint the exact location of targets .
Ever since the introduction of civilian causality countermeasure technology , Bloomberg reports that 1,300 militants were killed and only 30 civilians killed in drone attacks in mid @-@ 2008 .
The New America Foundation believes that civilian casaulties have decreased from 25 % to an estimated 6 % , with a total of 18 civilians killed since August 2010 .
On the grounds of legality , according to the Geneva Convention , members of regular armed forces - involved in conflicts - are the only persons who may be considered lawful combatants and authorised to use lethal force .
The operators in Pakistan are the United States ( USAF ) and the Pakistani military .
So , who really murders more ?
Islamic fundamentalist groups total of 35,000 casualties ( since 2003 ) or the United States @' 385 casualties ( since 2004 ) ?
why can n't people think the same thing ? if it was two american kids dad there would be media furore .
I did n't see these two kids names on the news ?
Yet we see soldiers who made a choice to go and fight on the news when they die .
Actually , it does
That is the very definition of democracy , if something passes by the tiniest fraction of a percent needed then everyone and everything else can be ignored .
Of course this is not how we work , but then you can n't start saying we 're undemocratic because people do n't turn out for the vote , that is their problem , not the governments .
And please don;t get started on the coalition .
It is democratic because together they received more votes than Labour , so they have a right to power .
Right , so to you there 's no difference in blowing up 100 's of civilians in a crowded market place , and blowing up a building but phoning the threat in beforehand to minimise civilian casualties ? In that case , it 's ok every , Bishy just basically said collaterol damage does n't exist for any Western forces as there 's no distinction between force used . Let 's start bombing civilian areas , it just does n't matter apparently And of course , I do n't condone either group , afterall , the IRA 's aims were only achieved after they laid down their arms .
No more than it is for someone to blow you up .
there seems to be a misconception held by some that america is not a welfare state .
does anyone know the percentage of gdp they spend on welfare and benefits of all kinds compared to say britain or the scandanavian nations ?
- who are usually considered the biggest welfare states in the world .
EDIT @:
ok , so i have had look today and it looks like america spends 46 % of its budget on welfare programmes .
59 % if you add pensions .
look at this chart here from the us government spending website .
it has 24 % health , 22 % pensions , and 13 % welfare .
is that how to work it out ?
http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/federal_spending
Yes , a lot of money ( read . too much money ) is spent on SS etc.
However , the taxation rates on average are still 10 % higher at least in european nations .
This is why we need a republican government to try and decrease our ridiculous government spending .
Republicans do nothing but spend money , and fight wars --- and encourage wars --- and spend more money trying to put americans in a constant state of fear .
Republicans are a joke
Apparently 44 % of Americas budget is spent on Medicare / Medicaid and Social Security which is a joke considering how naff American welfare is
Suppose you got a letter that stated you must attend a month of military training before you are sent to Iran / Zimbabwe / Syria to protect the civilians from oppression .
It must be on ground to minimise civilian casualties .
Your friends are going to protect these civilians too .
Do you go or do you sacrifice your dignity ?
This is a "@ humanitarian @" mission after all .
Not going would in no way sacrifice your dignity .
What if you have three children to feed ?
How would making the choice not to leave them alone and destitute mean you surrender your dignity .
This is nonsense .
In answer to the more general question you are trying to pose @: no , I would n't .
Anybody who does such work deserves all of our respect ( assuming no ulterior motive ) but it is n't for everyone , and that does n't make somebody a bad person .
I would protect my family and friends , I have no interest in personally protecting strangers @...
I 'm not here to save the world , in no way does that decision impact my dignity
In 1951 Libya was the poorest country in the world , before the nato intervention Libyans enjoyed the highest standard of living in Africa .
In Libya , homes are considered a human right .
Newly married couples receive $ 50,000 to buy their own home and electricity is free for all .
Im not making all this up
Gaddafi vowed to house every Libyan before his own parents , he kept his promise and his own father died before he was able to be housed .
Before Gaddaffi , less than 1 / 5 th of Libyans were literate .
Now education is free and high quality .
Literacy rate is now 83 % .
Healthcare is also free .
If libyans can not find the education or healthcare they need in Libya the government unds them to go abroad to access it .
All loans are interest free by law .
If a Libyan buys a car , the government pays 50 % of the price .
The price of fuel is $ .14 a gallon .
Any Libyan wishing to become a farmer is given free use of land , a home , equipment , livestock and seeds .
On July 1 sr 2011 , 1.7 million people assembled in Green Square , Tripoli to show defiance against the Nato bombing of Libya .
This represented around 95 % of the population of Tripoli .
The Libyan central bank is state owned and unlike banks in the west is now owned by the elite or ridden by debt .
Gaddafi did n't have to drive around in Libya with 8 inch thick glass or a tank like Obama does ,
search youtube , theres plenty of videos of him beign driven around waving and shaking hands of the dozens of people running after him .
2 years ago western leaders all over the world praised him .
Yes Gaddafi has been accused of some terrible things , but look at the things western leaders do all of the time .
The second he started giving out oil contracts to Russia / Asia he was ousted .
Disgusting .
OK , cool story , but here 's some facts @:
1 . He started a war in Chad - a crushingly poor nation that was in the middle of a civil war at the time - with the intent of establishing a puppet Jamahiriya that he could control .
Thankfully he failed after Chad , with the assistance of France , expelled his forces .
2 . He started this war in Chad by luring immigrants from Pakistan and poor Sahelian nations to Libya with the promise of civilian work , and then press @-@ ganging them into fighting as the Islamic Legion .
Many legionnaires are still a major threat to peace and stability in Central Africa today , specifically in Darfur where they are now known as the Janjaweed .
Perhaps you 've heard of them ?
3 . He directly funded terrorism against the United Kingdom in the form of the IRA , which he also trained and equipped , and sponsored other acts of international terrorism such as the Lockerbie bombing .
4 . He embezzled billions of dollars of public money to fund a lavish , dictatorial lifestyle for him and his family .
5 . He illegally proliferated nuclear weapons , chemical weapons and biological weapons in flagrant violation of international law .
6 . Any political dissent within Libya was brutally repressed by the Khamis Brigade , directly lead by Khamis Gaddafi - one of his sons , and composed of foreign mercenaries willing to do anything against the Libyan people for their next payslip .
7 . Libyan political refugees were assassinated by the state as a means to oppress the opposition to his rule .
If you have any love lost for this man you are a terrible human being .
I think he did that to keep his people happy so that people would be less likely to oppose him or he started out good genuinely wanting to help his people but became obsessed with power .
So vile .
How can a country like the USA , relatively liberal and tolerant , have such a powerful party of extremists ?
Britain has nothing to match the Republican Party , on social issues , apart from perhaps the BNP - but even they do n't hate on gays as much as the Republican Party does .
In 2011 , how can Americans even think of voting in such a party ?
It 's disgusting .
Shame on the republicans .
It 's an incredibly religious country @- and a very evangelical one at that .
As much as I hate their attitude , you need to understand that it 's just the way they 've been brought up to think
That being said , it is still shocking that this type of discrimination still exists @...
The people who get involved in politics to the degree of going to debates are , thankfully , not representative of the majority of people over there .
Does n't stop them being dicks , though
And ? This is surprising ?
It 's known that the USA is n't as progressive as Western Europe with regards to gay rights and attitudes towards gay people .
To be fair , Santorum is probably just a confused idiot .
He said that sex has no place in the military and orientation is irrelevant , which I agree with .
But then he said he 'd bring DADT back , which is disagree with .
But the booing of the soldier was terrible make no mistake .
If a gay soldier is better than , or just as good as a straight soldier , then it makes no difference what their sexuality is .
At the end of the day , if I was serving on the front line with other troops , I 'd want the best troops , not the straightest .
What makes me laugh is that the usual anti @-@ American crowd has jumped on this thread with all the "@ vile @" and "@ disgusting @" comments .
The same crowd that gets into a lather about the evil empire of Israel and the poor Palestinians blahblahblah .
The USA has legalised gay marriage in some states , and federal equality laws . Sure , some people are n't up with that - but that 's freedom for you .
Contrast this with the wonders of the Palestinan Authority , where it is a criminal offence to be gay and punishable by imprisonment .
You hear a lot of criticism of Israel - but if you had to , would you rather live there or one of its closest neighbours ? Bearing in mind Israel 's freedoms , prosperity , etc.
Note @: I know some of the countries do n't physically neighbour Israel , but they are extremely close so they count .
Eygpt , probably because they 're comparitively level and calm . ( I said comparatively ) .
For religious , political and social freedom . Israel
Because it 's the most westernised , Israel .
I know a LOT of Lebanese people and let me tell you , they 're the most fun loving persons I have ever met .
Really open @-@ minded and peaceful .
It looks really beautiful too !
Israel because its the least likely country to get bombed and invaded by Israel
Jordan or Israel .
Plus to all the people saying Egypt , really ?
Its future is very uncertain and Christians ( assuming some of you are ) are routinely not treated properly .
I really have no idea why -- unless you were a devout Muslim -- you would choose Saudi Arabia over Israel .
Unless you have no care for any of your freedoms .
And before anyone makes any sarcy comments about Israel , at least a woman can drive there @..
None , when I was in Cyprus the heat was too annoying , so I 'd rather not reside in that region .
Lebanon . Beirut is a relaxed , westernised place and the party capital of the middle east
Cyprus @... what ?
Its only a little swim away i 'd call it a neighbor , lived there for 2 years , lovely , go for a swim in the sea catch some rays on the saturday , then off to build a snowman on Troodos on the sunday , great little island .
I saw the news story about the submariner who went on a killing spree on a nuclear submarine and it worried me quite a bit .
Is it realistic that in the next 30 years there 'll be worldwide dismantlement of all nuclear weapons intended for killing other humans ?
Never hopefully .
Nuclear weapons have kept the worlds superpowers from wiping each other out
The Submarine was just powered by a Nuclear Reactor , it fires non nuclear warheads .
The day they 'll be gotten rid of is the day something more powerful is invented .
We have every reason to hope that does n't happen , tbh .
Why would governments and companies in certain countries sell arms to an offensive country when they attack a country they dislike but then attack that country when it attacks a country they do like
this is double standards !
I am talking about the Iraq before and during the Gulf War .
Iraq attacked Iran then governments were happy to sell weapons to Iraq including UK , France , US , West Germany , Italy , China and Soviet Union .
Some of them were even selling to both sides such as US , Soviet Union and China .
A small minority sold only to Iran these were North Korea and surprizingly Israel according to Israel ( although Iran denies this ) .
Why would all these countries be happy for Iraq to go on the war path and to fund both all sides of the war yet go after Iraq when it starts on Kuwait ( although they left Saddam in power ) .
My thoughts are that governments simply let their private arms companies make a bit of cash off the war like they usually do .
They used their puppet governments of the Shah and Saddam to control the countries to counter Soviet influence in the region .
When the Islamic revolution happened the US lost all their influence over the nation so after Iraq began their attempted invasion they happily cast a blind eye in order to regain influence .
Then when they saw Saddam invading country they already had influence in Kuwait they finally took action although they left him in power as the Soviets were still there and would n't want Iraq to become communist .
Then 12 years later there is no longer a Soviet union but they notice a strengthening Iran that is a potential threat to their ally Israel so when some they get some '@ evidence @' of Iraq with nuclear material from a known unreliable source via MI6 they jump with joy to invade it .
It is a win win for their publicity they either take out evil dictator Saddam or they stop Iraq getting nukes .
Then they build up their bases in Iraq and fund a new government to counter the threat of Iran as they lost all influence upon Iraq when they stopped them in the first gulf war .
These wars are just ways to prevent other nations gaining any sort of power whether it is directly or indirectly as well as make their arms companies some major money on the side .
So if you still think the US and co are the just and honourable governments they claim to be why would they allow companies to fund two sides of a war ?
why would they go to war over an ideology ?
why would they only take action when a puppet state is invaded ?
Well , what are you proposing to replace it with ?
Because governments change every 4 years in most places and every government tends to pursue a different policy .
Blair sold guns to Gaddafi and Cameron helped oust him , you can n't look at it as if Cameron is bound or responsible for the actions of Blair
A countries actions should n't ( and luckily do n't ) depend on moral standards .
It is naive to think they should .
There are far more important political and economical reasons for military intervention or political sanctions .
I certainly do n't , they 're mostly hypocrites .
If only we could make the leaders look right into the eyes of every civilian they kill , maybe the fighting and wars would stop .
Obviously I know it never will , but I can dream .
There is so much discussion these days about race , muslims , etc. that I get the feeling there are underlying problems .
Personally I feel sorry for them ( non whites and Muslims ) as they bear the brunt of these discussions .
Or are we just in denial of racial and ethnic problems in society ?
''@ learn from history @'' - yes , and it teaches us ''@ multiculturalism @'' actually always fails .
I do however believe we could get along together , if we figured out how .
Douchebags like this being given a forum to air their views is fanning a lot of contagious stupidity
well this is the case no matter the denial .
its funny , when muslims plants bombs , the first thing people say is , '@ why did they do this ? @' , well , fair enough , because its better to understand motives , the same applies to the growth of nationalism in europe .
many factors are at play , anti white racism , immigrant crime which targets white people disproportionally , mass invasion immigration policy , abuse of immigration and welfare systems .
it is no use just blaming '@ racism @' as it misses the issues .
so everyone is just getting along fine ,
regardless of race , religion , nationality and ethnicity etc. ?
I do n't think that is true either
I 'm as right @-@ wing as they come , but why are the British keeping hold of islands that are not theirs ?
They are thousands of miles away .
I long for the day that the islands are reunited with Argentina and diplomatic relations between Britain and Argentina can resume .
What are your thoughts ?
When hell freezes over .
When the Falkland Islanders decide they want to be Argentinian .
They are quite fond of being British right now .
Is this another name for the Falklands ?
As I understand it , the inhabitants of these islands feel a strong sense of Britishness , and want to continue to remain British .
The islands belong to the islanders , not argentina , and if the islanders say they want to be argentinian , or independent , then the islands would cease to be british .
Can you not understand the difference between an individual in one country wanting to be a citizen of another ( basically a wannabe migrant ) and a state wishing to retain its territorial status ?
In your American example , that 's the difference between a dude in Azerbaijan saying "@ I want to be American - why can n't I ? @" and Hawaii saying "@ We want to remain part of the US @" .
That 's true ; the oil in the Falklands is not a major factor .
Although I do believe that if the majority of Islanders wish to be British we should keep the Islands .
When we get Ireland '@ back @' .
I mean they in no way want to be part of the UK , but they 're right next to us , so they should be @...
Why does the term '@ Las Malvinas @' even exist ?
Why do n't I just call Argentina '@ dickhead land @' .
Also , OP , ignorance much ?
They already belong to the UK and the UK grants them local governance .
So technically they already belong to their owners .
They never were united with Argentina
The problem with this logic is there are more than enough people who think differently to cover the costs - and they ( or anyone in fact ) could n't care less what you think .
They will be paying for the defence themselves if with the oil revenue as well so there will be even less reason for you to complain in the future .
I have to write about the IMFs involvement in current affairs for school , i must have been living under a rock for the past few months because I have NO idea at all as to what the IMFs involvment with Greece is , ive tried to google it but all the different information is confusing me , can anyone explain please ?
They are called in when countries fail to run their economy properly .
Of course Eurocrats failed to see what was happening @... what do you expect from hansomly @-@ paid , non @-@ audited people resposible for other @-@ people 's money ?
Like the fall of the Roman Empire , the whole mess is gonna get worse .
In May China 's CPI went up by 5.5 % year @-@ on @-@ year , 5.3 % in cities and 6.0 in rural areas .
Attention that the food prices went up by an astonishing 11.7 % .
This is definitely increasing the pressure on its economic growth .
Everyone has his / her point of view .
That 's only a percentage point higher than the UK , but unlike us they have double digit economic growth so have plenty of room to work with .
I mean , if inflation is 5.5 % but the economy grows 10.5 % , that 's net wealth creation of 5 % is n't it ?
Or is there something I 'm missing ?
even if the rate of economic growth almost doubles the rate of inflation , the effects of this high rate of inflation are still prominent ; especially due to china 's very unequal distribution of wealth .
"@ 5.3 % in cities and 6.0 in rural areas @"
The rural areas accommodate many of the peasants in china and as it faced such high rises in food prices and a 6 % rise in general prices , those peasants are going to find it increasingly hard to purchase their commodities .
I am sure many of us are well aware of Samuel Huntington 's "@ Clash of Civilizations @" theory , that future conflict would be along cultural lines between "@ West @" , "@ East @" and "@ Confucian @" blocks , whatever they are .
What does everyone think ?
Does the theory hold weight or is it just a product of modern day Oriental @-@ ism ?
The OP 's mind is moving in , in my opinion , the right direction .
Conflicts are almost always caused by political and economic issues rather than cultural ones , even if motives for fighting may ostensibly appear to be over religion , for example .
If you have JSTOR access and have n't read Ervand Abrahamian 's article on Huntington , then I recommend it .
Something that caught my eye today .
It seems Australia is proposing a ban on the cultivation and possession of a range of plants that contain certain psychoactive substances .
These are the plants that are already included in Australias ban list @:
- all plants in the Cannabis genus
- all plants in the Erythroxylum genus ( Which cocaine is derived from )
- Papaver somniferum and Papaver bracteatum ( opium poppies )
- all fungi that contain psilocin and psilocybin ( magic mushrooms )
These are the plants that would be added to the ban list @:
- Savia divinorum
- Kratom
- Khat
- Brugmansia
- Datura ( the former and latter both common garden flowers , but are crap as recreational drugs due to their high toxicity . Idiots who try it once will n't try it again , if they survive . )
- Any plant that contains Ephedrine
- Any plant containing Mescaline
- Any plant containing DMT ( this is the one i find most absured as there are litterally 100 s if not 1000 s of plants and trees that contain this substance , many grow wild in Australia and are commonly used in landscaping .
DMT even occurs naturally in humans and most other mammals , are they going to ban humans and mammals too ! ? )
As a horticulturalist myself , i find the Australian authorities proposals to be highly disturbing .
This is completely pointless legislation , bureaucracy at its finest , that is going to criminalise potentially millions of innocent people who work with these plants or grow them ornamentally in their gardens .
And just how do they expect to be able to enforce a ban on litterally thousands of species of plants ?
Its insanity , you can n't legislate nature .
And then of course we come back to the old chesnut ; most of the substances in these proposed plants are less harmful and addictive than legal substances , such as alcohol and tobacco .
Mescaline and DMT actually cause less harm to the body than CAFFEINE .
Anyhoo , rant over .
This article is a few months old , so i do n't know if this made it into the law books or if it was thrown out , so if anyone has any information id like to hear about it .
Heres hoping common sense prevails for once .
how do they ban cannabis in australia ?
dosent it grow as a @....@ well weed
It 's your responsibility to use drugs sensibly and your choice whether you abuse them or not .
It 's no right of the government or anyone to control what you consume .
I think the government should tackle drug use and damaged lives by providing support for those who need it , not by criminalising them .
Many drug addicts get send to prison and are given Methadone to '@ ease @' their addictions to crack , meth or heroin .
Obviously that 's wrong .
=/ that 's the harsh reality of it .
ban the substance in the first place .
it will cause damage now to those addicted but better for long term
i do see the value of rehab though
It 's the illegality of drugs that makes the production , distribution and use of those drugs hugely expensive and harmful to everyone .
Most of the outlawed drugs , if taken with a bit of knowledge and awareness , are mostly as harmful , if not much less harmful , than tobacco or alcohol .
What did you think of the first 2012 Republican debate on Thursday ?
It featured Tim Pawlenty , Ron Paul , Herman Cain , Gary Johnson , and Rick Santorum .
It is in the early days , so there were n't that many candidates .
And what did you think of the Saturday Night Live version of the ‘@ undeclared @’ candidate 's debate .
It featured impressions of Michele Bachmann , Donald Trump , Mitt Romney , Newt Gingrich , Jimmy McMillan , and of course , Sarah Palin played by the legendary Tina Fey !
I thought it was great . Pure humour .
Edit @: Mike Huckabee was n't in either . Hmm @....
I like Ron Paul more and more
Herman Cain I would support any means to protect the country . Not liking the sound of that
The Fox News one seemed to be let down by the fact that so many of the undeclared big names were n't there ( for the obvious reason that they 're undeclared ) .
Ron Paul would be the lead runner of those that took part , but the SNL people are far more likely to be the main contenders .
That said , where was Obama this time in the 2008 race ?
Notwithstanding a few of his religious nutter @-@ esque social views Ron Paul is the only Republican who actually makes sensible points about big government and the only one I have any respect for .
Too bad he 's never going to be President given the state of the Republican party .
I just saw a similar thread on SAudi arabia , so i thought , why not in Pakistan as well ?
I do n't need to explain the situation there @...... but should n't they have a revolution ?
The press is relatively free so people have a medium they can vent through .
There are too many factions that are fighting amongst each other - if they unite under a common cause then there would be a serious threat of revolution .
Firstly , Gaddafi was not an enemy of ours .
Secondly , Gaddafi is the autocrat of his country , if he wishes to stamp out rebellion , it 's his prerogative .
All states hold the right to defend their own interests .
Humans are cruel , people should get over it , it 's our nature .
Additionally , should n't our own armed forces be used for national defence only ?
Of all of these conflicts over the past 20 @-@ 30 years or so , which directly affected our interests @:
- the Falklands
- the first Gulf War ( liberation of Kuwait )
- Bosnia
- Sierra Leone
- Kosovo
- Second Gulf War ( removal of Saddam )
I would say only The Falklands .
The Falklands the first Gulf War and to an extent the second gulf war .
I see what your saying but if we have a chance to help people fight for democracy and not be brutally crushed then we should do something .
We rarely get the chance to support rebellions as in most cases the rebels are as bad as the government they are fighting .
Libya can be seen as a popular uprising against a Tyrant .
No doubt people complain but they would complain if we did nothing to .
No one wants to see another Rwanda and this event seems to signify a much more proactive Right foreign policy from the UK .
And before people shout oil at me .
Well you are just going to have to wait until after this ends are n't you to see if it was .
Frankly I can not imagine why companies would negotiate oil contracts only to try to convince the government to invade the country so they lose them .
Taking some of the responsibility for enforcing a no fly zone ( i.e. patrolling shooting down any planes which Gadaffi uses to bomb civilians ) would have been acceptable due to the UN resolution and the fact that civilians in Benghazi were sitting ducks .
However , bombing ground troops in order to allow armed rebels to rampage further west is , in my opinion , completely against the spirit of the UN resolution .
I increasingly get the impression that the coalition are not protecting civilians ( i.e. unarmed citizens , not rebels ) but rather are passively supporting the rebellion by decimating Gadaffi 's soldiers who , at the end of the day , are just doing what they are told .
It 's easy to shout oil and the fact that it gets shouted so often means that it 's also brushed off by those supporting military action , without a thorough evaluation .
Oil is not the only reason why the coalition are backing the rebels ( and I 'm going to take the plunge now and say that they are ) , but it is certainly a consideration .
Gadaffi has stated that ( assuming he regains control over his country ) he will only sell oil to the Russians and the Chinese .
The rebels on the other hand have stated that they are willing to upgrade oil production in Benghazi three @-@ fold .
People can argue that we are doing our bit by helping out the Libyans in their time of crisis .
But why have n't we intervened in the numerous conflicts in Africa over the past 20 / 30 years
I agree that we should be helping out all these innocent people ( im sure if it was the other way around we would want help from more powerful countries )
But why there and not in other places ?
I do think our main reason for helping is oil and resources , which is pretty much as bad as doing nothing as we 're not setting the example of helping people out in a time of crisis , its more of a " we 'll help but only because we might get something in return @"
I know this is just how the world works , but there would be alot less trouble in the world if it was n't .
Anybody who believes the British Empire , once again , intervened in yet another country on '@ humanitarian grounds @' to protect '@ innocent civilians @' is absolutely ignorant of history and can not use mere logic , or at least does not apply it to '@ Queen and Country @' .
Or , they could be the opposite of independent thinkers and accept the propaganda spouted by the establishment .
If the rebels were Communists , the intervention lead by the United States , Britain and France in Libya would not have occurred , nor would the rebel opposition be supported , had they been Communists .
In other words , the intervention in Libya is not about protecting civilians , but instead entirely about protecting interests and siding with a candidate whom the '@ coalition @' prefers .
If this was not the case , the United States would be intervening exactly how they are today in Libya , even if the rebels had been the Taliban .
Furthermore , Britain and France have always stated from the very beginning that they were willing to intervene in Libya without the approval of the United Nations .
Yet the justification they keep using for this intervention is to '@ enforce humanitarian law authorised by the United Nations @' .
To be blunt while being honest @...
History will show once again , that the real reasons for this Capitalist @-@ lead intervention in Libya was not about '@ defending innocent people @' .
And when it does , all those who supported this intervention should be held accountable for their ignorance and the crime of strengthening a system which has consistently proven , through its billions of dead victims , to be the greatest monster this world has ever seen .
ok guys , we 've seen how the egyptians successfully brought mubarak down and at the same time theres also a lot of protesting goin around the middle east countries ; tunisia , bahrain , algeria etc. @....
although it may not seem like it has nothing to do with religion , just politics @...@ i feel like the world is coming to an end or something cause muslims are finally taking a stance for their rights @....
after this , what next ?
was just wondering could there be an islamic revolution perhaps in the near future where the world is like coming to an end ???
this is probably a really stupid question but just give me some feedback about this matter
The answer is no .
guys @..@ i know its a bit tedious but im just wondering @..
if you guys can be bother than do n't bother reading it then !
God willing , yes , if only to overthrow the corrupt governments in place in these countries .
None of these protests are Islamic in nature .
They tend to be secular leaderless and made u mostly of the young .
What is wrong with Muslims speaking up for their rights ???
explain yourself .
And as far as an Islamic revolution is concerned i would say that it depends on how organized religious or clerical organizations are in a country and how politicized they are .
Any analysis on the issue can n't be a one size fits all jacket since the nature of the protests vary in all said countries .
It apeas Noth Korea has started enriching uranium at a brand new plant that apparently is very modern .
Seems odd they could build this . Im betting on a lot of Chinese maybe even Russia help .
It would appear they are going to ake more nukes .
Ok so what are your thoughts on this ?
Are they a danger ?
Will this change anything ?
Could we see a much more aggressive north Korea ?
Or will nothing change ?
I very much doubt Russia would be involved in this .
China are sympathisers with the communist regime so possibly links there .
There 's very little anyone can do about it because bombing their nuclear facilities will result in Seoul being obliterated and most of South Korea being destroyed without nukes .
The only hope is if Dear Leader 's son allows change but do n't hold your breath .
Hey guys , Reading the news daily , I can n't help but notice that occasionally , the western media ( CNN and sometimes BBC ) pictures China as a country who is heartless , has no respect for human rights , dictatorship etc. etc.
However , this past summer , i went to China for holiday , and it was nothing like the western media pictured it to be , the people all seem to enjoy life , no signs of human rights abuses ( i traveled to Tibet to , the people seemed happy ) .
I can n't help but feel that the western media is portraying only one side of the story ( Tibet ) , when in reality we Brits have also invaded Tibet and the world said nothing .
I see that we are afraid of a communist country rising , and i know they are n't the nicest people , but neither were we when we colonized 1 / 4 of the world , or when the Americans drove the Indians off their land .
Are we right to be complaining about China when we do n't have a clean record either ?
Do you think that the western media is demonizing China ?
As a westerner , do you think China is a cold , heartless dictatorship ?
I 'm half Chinese and the Western media is definitely demonizing China .
The Chinese government has more support from its people than the British government does .
When the West criticizes China about its lack of democracy of humans rights abuses it 's usually only the West who has a problem with it and not the average Chinese person .
And why are these clowns always complaining about Tibet ?
The fact that they do n't care about Uyghurs just shows what hypocrites and bigots they are .
That 's because whenever a Chinese person does complain they get thrown in prison or shot .
China 's record on human rights is appalling look at the one child policy that is causing major gender imbalance problems as well as being brutally implemented , forced sterliseation and such .
although I do n't criticise it on democracy as democracy is always right or good .
As for the more popular than the British government source ?
The media demonoising china is just what the media does , it demonises everything its how they sell papers with horror stories .
Even if they get nukes iran are still heavily outmanned , outgunned and isolated .
Their nukes will n't be as good as american and european nukes .
Their UAV 's will n't be as good as isreali and american UAV 's
Their missiles will barley cross their own borders before they are shot down by a multitude of defences the USA has ALREADY been preparing in the middle east for the past god knows how long .
The only thing the extremist muslims can possibly do is blow themselves up in our borders .
And they have failed that more than enough times .
iran is a empty threat .
Iran with nukes however will unify and strengthen the resolve and moral of the muslims
Iran wants to portray itself as the '@ hero @' of the muslims against the western infidels by having nukes and defying the USA .
So the more we talk about it , the more coveradge they get and the more muslim extreamists will orgasm at the sound of USA 's threats .
So lets ignore iran , they are like the kid in primary school with the attention seeking problem .
Meh Maybe if the came clean with their nuclear program and would accept help that the rest of the world is offering .
If they are so peaceful why not allow UN inspectors in .
The problem is n't that they could potentially outmatch us in terms of nuclear capability .
The problem is that its monstrous regime will become more stable , and will be able to dictate the rest of the world 's policy towards it .
Plus , one must consider the potential ramifications of thermonuclear weapons falling into the hands of a regime run by the clergy ; a clergy that has repeatedly laid claims to the island nation of Bahrain , supports Nasrallah 's thuggish militia in Lebanon , makes continual references to the apocolypse and the return of the '@ twelfth imam @' , and so on .
That 's without going into how it will make a complete mockery of international law and non @-@ proliferation .
Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II dies , Prime Minister Julia Gillard has said just days ahead of a general election .
Welsh @-@ born Ms Gillard said the Queen 's death would be an "@ appropriate point @" for Australia to move away from having a British monarch as head of state .
Australians voted against becoming a republic in a 1999 referendum , but the issue continues to be divisive .
So , who thinks Australia would vote for a republic ?
It 's up to them if they wish to sever the bonds that unite their heritage , history , and present .
I do n't think the issue is that they have a hereditary monarch , but the fact that the hereditary monarch in question is a '@ foreign @' one ( yes , I am aware she is Queen of Australia in her own right , but you know what I mean ) .
I think they should keep the monarchy @...
the monarchy exists here for the same reason it does over there .
Heritage , history and present , as the above poster rightly said .
It 's not a drain on their economy and their power and sovereignty is n't being controlled in real political terms .
I do , however , agree with the proposed flag change , if that 's what Australians want .
Hold another referendum !
Are we witnessing a new era of repression .
In the past nations would develop new technology to dominate its rivals , however with recent attempts to prevent Iran from developing Nuclear technology are we seeing powerful nations using economic terrorism ( sanctions ) and war to prevent other nations from developing technology to compete .
For a nation with civilian and military nuclear technology to essentially deny another nation the same right to develop technology it is clear that the old guard of westenr powers are trying to prevent emerging powers from developing the same level of technology .
How can Iran stake its claim to its right ?
Economic terrorism ( sanctions ) are essentially a way to ruin an economy its a modern day version of a siege and an act of war .
The sanctions placed on Iran are designed to appear to target only military groups but with research you will see it massively targets civilian business , infrastructure and even the attempt of Iranian students to study outside of Iran .
This is an all out attempt to cut of Irans blood flow and crush this nation .
What should other nations learn from this ?
Other developing nations would be wise to realise that western powers have a stake in preventing the development of nations they consider inferior particularly Asian , African and South American nations .
This realisation should make them realsie they must band together to defeat this racist threat .
I would suggest an economic block and the sharing of nuclear technology within this block to ensure their sovereignty from both military and economic war .
America has a vested interest in keeping certain nations poor and weak but with solidarity and strength these nations can rise up and defy this evil threat .
Hmm here is a country that generally does n't like me should I let them build a big nuclear weapon they can kill me with ?
*@ thinks hard @*
Iran will get destroyed by the Israelis before it has a chance to get a nuclear weapon , and if Israel is unable to do so then the Israeli race would be ( excuse the pun ) exterminated .
How can you be in favour of this ?
You make it out like hampering a nations development is somthing new !
Since the dawn of civilization countries and provinces have sort do out do each other and gain from others weakness .
You say it is crazy that america forces sanction on Iran , yet it is not in their economic or defence interests to allow this to happen so in fact it is perfectly sane .
If iran were to developed nuclear weapon , they would use them , and they would , theoretically , become the powerhouse in the middle east .
This is against US forgien policy for two reasons , firstly they need to secure the safty of the oil fields in the middle east , and secondaly an anti @-@ western superpower in the middle east will more likely that not attract the backing of China , who already have made it perfeclty clear that they are inforcing their dominance over Africa .
The combination of an Iranian @-@ Chinese block in Asia and Africa would seriously threatern the US and the whole Western world .
Thus , it is just and needed for the US to impose such sanctions on Iran .
If ahmadinejad did say this , does he have any info as to what is gonna go down ?
Do you think the americans will strike other ME countries in the run up to the iran attack or simulataneously strike ?
Could be syria perhaps ?
Just hope we do n't get dragged into this war ; we can n't even deal with the taliban @...
let the american / israelis deal with it !
There 's nothing about it on the BBC , but yes , a strike is inevitable .
I highly doubt the Americans / Israelis will strike any other Middle Eastern countries , in fact , I can not see it happening whatsoever .
The United Kingdom will do exactly as the United States says because of this idiotic perception that both of our nations share a '@ special relationship @' .
The United Kingdom will be dragged into it , you can bet your bottom dollar on that .
Substantial evidence has been presented to prove large quantities of Depleted Uranium ( DU ) has been used in Iraq since the invasion in 2003 .
[ Edit ] Ok since alot of people think the '@ Tehran Times @' is untrustworthy I will give another source which gives the same information about Liam Fox 's statement .
I can n't bring myself to understand this in any way .
I remember seeing some pictures of deformities a little while back and could n't even believe it was humanly possible .
They disturbed for a few days after and that 's from someone who is n't easily upset .
Back then I always believed that the leaders of our militaries would never allow this .
They would never allow generations of Iraqi 's to suffer from mutations and deformities like these .
I passed it off as propaganda at the time but now the evidence seems substantial and clear that this is exactly what happened .
What is the most upsetting is that our taxes funded this .
Our taxes causes girls to be born with two heads like something straight out of a horror film .
How can this ever be rectified ?
How can you explain to the children why they are born with paralysed limbs or are born with their eyes formed inside out ?
How can you rectify a system which has done to Iraq what it 's done over the decades .
From supporting tyrants , to watching on and doing nothing , to several large scale wars , to crippling sanctions .
What harm were they afraid of from these ordinary , poor Iraqis .
You can n't rectify .
That 's ******* disgusting and I hope the perpertrators are made to suffer what generations of Iraqi 's already have and will ever endure .
Remember those who champion themselves on human rights are actually the biggest terrorists in the world .
certain places like fallujah , tikrit , mosul atc , baathi scum strongholds deserve it for what they did to Iraq and the Iraqi people under saddam 's ( May God curse him ) regime .
That 's ******** for a start the US would not a shell a town with DU , it 's high density means it is used for penetrator core for armour piercing sabot rounds , to be used against tanks .
It 's a kinetic energy round and would serve no purpose other than in a pitched tank battle , of which there were n't that many in GW2 .
And that 's the Independent article , I do n't even need to bother trying to discredit something from the '@ Tehran Times @' .
Well that 's war is n't it ?
Never liked it but when war happens you have to expect any atrocities .
They want to sue the UK and US ?
It is a ******* war we would be stupid to give them money because they will only use it for weaponry to fight against our armed forces and they will probably plant some DU in our country or even nuke us innocent civillians for payback .
Sure we all want war to be just and we all think nothing like this should happen , but you 'd be naive to think this is possible and this is how a war should be conducted .
It 's a ******* war .
Do n't tell me Muslim countries like Iran and pre @-@ war Iraq would n't invoke such methods if they could .
Apologies for being so inevitably stupid but @...@ J Am I wrong in thinking superpowers are judged by their worth , their GDP ?
If so , how can China overtake the US even as it grows in this area ?
It is still way off the US GDP .
I know the US have a lot of debt , and a great deal of it is owed to China
Also , are n't Japan ahead of China in terms of GDP ?
when you have 1 billion+ people , its almost impossible not to become a super power @...@ even if your army are fighting with swords and bows @....@ cos it simply is n't possible to win against the sheer amount of numbers
True , thanks for that .
But it 's not like their population swelled overnight , or is it ?
I 'm just trying to find out more about the subject really @..
IMO @: growing military strength , economic potential and influence in international affairs make a superpower .
its their industry , cheap labour , huge workforce , investment in technology and hard working nature .
China is investing in the future , we here in Britain really are not @...
China is going for it headlong and because of this are developing more and more and discovering new things .
China also has less strict laws on what not to do @...@ i.e. they will test and fund things that we have regulations against .
They have huge industry which they do n't care much in the way of climate problems .
They have a massive population ready for any dirty job .
Finally , they are a hard working people with dedication and less slobby
Do we really want another superpower ?
Compared to the others , China look like a bunch of savages @: disgusting human and animal rights records and a lack of freedom .
The GDP is rapidly rising each year .
LOL @- Russia 's economy is less than half the size of France and Germany 's and almost half as small as the UK 's .
Coupled with the fact that the country has just been through a huge reccesion that has wiped off more than 10 % of its GDP , and that it is falling to pieces through political instability , I think im right to say its a joke @- not to mention the fact that its entire economy is based around exporting natural resources that will soon run out .
It also worth mentioning that as soon as conventional oil reserves run out , the US and Canada will have by far the biggest reserves in the world in the form of Oil Shale etc.
Did you just refer to information from Wikipedia in your argument ?
And some are sort of mutually intelligble .
They all share the same writing language though which I reckon distinguishes from most other languages .
Worthy enough of calling each sub @-@ language a dialect I 'd say .
China already is a super power ; US monetary policy is practically dictated by China .
If they wanted to crap all over the $ they could do it on a whim - no other country on the planet has the ability to do so , let alone devalued their currency to such an extent it makes their exports look ridiculously cheap .
China in the global market .
It is a superpower without question .
However to be a super @-@ power you do n't strictly have to be a developed economy .
China is decades from being as developed as the US , regardless of the amount of money they have - Chinas greatest compromise is time .
Major cities are much closer to their Western counterparts , however it is beyond where the issue lie in Chinas push as a credible economic entity .
What @... so because i referred to wikipedia somehow my argument is null and void ?
seriously get a clue .
I got a few Chinese people telling me that China will be #1 in the future .
A few years back , Newsweek magazine published articles about China 's becoming the next big thing .
Hard to tell but anything is possible .
I bet Soviet Union had no idea they 'd be perished in the late 80 s-early 90 s .
Like some people said this in thread , US will n't allow it .
US wants to be the only example that represents democracy ( Iraq being replaced with democratic system , etc. ) .
Because China is a communist country , it would be harder for them to influence other countries politically like how Great Britian influenced its idea to different regions of the world ( US in language , Hong Kong in legal structure and language , etc. ) .
30 @-@ 40 years is a very long time , I 'm not denying that China has potential and could potentially become the most powerful country in the world .
Notice the world could in bold , some people would argue that if it continues this growth it would become the world 's most powerful country , both economically and militarily even I can see that , but the US will inevitably interfere , because it simply does n't want competition , it wants to remain being the biggest , baddest dude on the block , and with China arriving on the world stage ( i.e. the new kid on the block ) there 'll inevitably and undoubtably be confrontations .
I think China will become the world 's second largest economy - perhaps even the largest , I think China will become very strong militarily - perhaps not as strong as the US as it is light years behind , but still strong , perhaps even stronger than all of Europe combined without the use of nukes .
Do I think China will become a US type superpower ?
Meaning that its economy and military are both 10 times stronger than everyone elses - no I do n't , as I 've pointed out in my previous post , there 'll China will inevitably want to become the regional power of Asia , it 'll want to do some land @-@ grabbing of its own ( Taiwan for example ) which will lead to its demise .
Well I think Iran 's only real crime has been defying US energy interests in the region .
We saw what happened last time Iran defied the US in 1953 under Mossadegh , and the result was a CIA coup to put in someone who would happily bleed their country dry of their resources .
The US have only themslefes to blame for the move to the theocratical tyranny we see now , and most people would agree Iran pose no global threat , but western propaganda representing Iran as some nuclear threat has n't been based on IAEA reports or reason , but as the crescent of the '@ axis of evil @' , that is those who dare to step out of line .
All roads are pointing towards an attack of some sort .
Whether this is jumping on the back of a popular revolution , or air strikes , who knows , but one is for sure ; an attack would have serious implications , and not just the further destablisation of the region .
I do n't think either the US or the Soviet Union tick the boxes for me .
Neither gained significant land , neither won any significant wars ( indeed , the most famous war America was involved in post WWII was Vietnam , which they flunked ) - hardly characteristics of a traditional superpower .
Superpowers tend to make huge strides in bettering the lives of human civilisation ( the Romans did it by furthering democracy , the British Empire did it with the industrial revolution ) .
The US and SU certainly did n't make any groundbreaking revolutions .
These two countries are best known for stockpiling weapons and racing to the moon - not characteristics of being a superpower .
They had the potential military might to rival classic superpowers , but times have changed so much that it was just never going to happen .
My professor raised this point this morning in class @:
" Hundreds and thousands of years ago , my family lived in Norway , in a consequent town where there were families like mine , making a little clan .
We were then chased from Norway , because we were invaded by Norwegians saying that we were strangers , while it had been our land for centuries and centuries , and we could n't be considered as strangers .
Do you ( asking the class ) think that nowadays , I could go back to Norway , and chase the people living there , with the only argument that my family lived there for hundreds of year ?
Bearing this in mind , do you think that Israelians 's motif for going back to their land is sufficient ? "
what do you think of it ?
Is he racist , or is he realistic ?
To be honest if Norway was the center of his religious beliefs and if he had been persecuted all the years after his family got kicked out he would have a different view .
More importantly he is Christian - and he is ruled by Christian governments .
Plus if you look at it from his point of view .
Conquest determines land holding .
His family was in Norway , they got conquered and so ceased to own the land .
Well the Arabs that used to live in Israel got '@ conquered @' per se - although a much more benign version of conquest - and so no matter what the original motives for the conquest were , they lost the right to that land .
He is neither racist nor realistic - just wrong .
Well , are they ?
I 'm using extremists lightly , I 'm just using the word as something to categorize them .
As in groups like BNP , Nazis and extremist Muslims or any partly aggressive religion , could they all be counted as bad as each other ?
They can all inspire hate , change stories and have radical / controversial views .
So could they be deemed on the same level ?
Nazis exterminated Jews @...
Extremist Muslism would liek to convert everyoen else @...
and BNP just wants to deport foreigners elsewhere @...
So no not really .
Hate ( although I believe broadly is a bad thing ) is something I can live with @...
Change stories ?
If you mean lie , then yes that is bad
Radical / controvesial are n't bad because they 're radical , they 're bad because of the belief itself .
Why ? Why do the public / media favour Islamic countries over Jewish ones ?
What have the Jews ever done compared to Muslims ?
I mean come on @...@ this seriously baffles me .
The BBC are biased against America , and therefore Israel .
It 's not really about muslims vs. jews .
This is not true at all .
During the recent attack on Gaza by Israel the BBC were the only channel to not broadcast an appeal for the innocent Muslims of Gaza . Even though all other channels did .
They seem to do pretty much the opposite of what you are saying .
Discuss
only way you have peace is by having a larger stick than the enemy ,
i prefer the U.S. to have all the power to say a unstable country like iran .
ROCK ON U.S.A FREE ISRAEL !
no point in discussing this .
I would say '@ no @' but they have nuclear weapons and no @-@ one is going to take them away from them .
Disclaimer @: I am really not an expert on American politics .
So , as well as the presidential election yesterday , American voters could also vote on a lot of state @-@ specific propositions , one of which was California 's proposition 8 .
Gay marriage has been legal in California since May , but this proposition was in favour of eliminating the rights of gay couples to marry .
It passed .
I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on this @..
I think its terrible .
They should n't be allowed to do an about turn like that for no apparent reason , especially given the fact that it only recently became allowed .
They could have at least given it a chance first .
It 's just even more of a shame that , at a time when America appears to be turning a new leaf , there 's still so many people with this frame of mind .
It just really bugs me that it got turned round so soon as well @..
Gay couples should be allowed the happiness that marriage may bring , just like straight couples .
They should have just kept it legal and let those who disagree have a grumble and grind their teeth over it all - it 's not like they 're suffering .
This suprised me to be honest , California has always been known as one of the more progressive states in the union .
The law will probably jump back and forth in the coming years .
California has a huge Roman Catholic population which obviously rejects it , not helped by the large influx of migrant S-American Catholics into the state .
Okay yes , true , they were allowed .
Which did mean people had the right to do them .
But I think the issue of the right to marry is different because people worked to get the right and to change the law for it to be allowed .
It was n't just a right because no one had told them they could n't do it , like your examples .
I think the issue here is not whether marriage is a right , but whether everyone should be considered equal .
Either everyone has the right to marry , or no one does .
Just as nobody has the '@ right @' to murder ( which quite frankly I find to be a weak argument due to reasons already mentioned ) , either nobody should have the right to marry , or everybody should .
That 's all there is to it .
I would argue that any law that I judge to be unjust is inherently illegitimate and thus I have no moral obligation to follow it or consider it to be a moral principle , nor would I use it to guide my decision making in any more than potentially in a practical sense .
I certainly could not and will not respect the rule of law when it imposes restrictions on two consenting adults expressing their love , and quite frankly I think that such unjust laws undermine the whole system .
You said you had n't considered prisoners not having the vote , and hypothesised that a good reason might be because they should have their rights removed for committing a crime .
And the incest argument is entirely related . If two people are happy together , why can n't they get married ?
You want one rule for all , stand by what you say , instead of dodging the uncomfortable reality that even you 're not happy with everybody having the same rights .
It forced schools to teach same-sex marriage as a morally EQUAL alternative , Cal like the rest of America is full of religious people and they do not see this as right .
It will only take away the right for same-sex couples to call it marriage , everything else is still there .
Well , you 're sort of right ; we 're all being treated as second class citizens , but you sort of missed the point .
Rights have been taken away in both instances .
The moral outrage ( here , anyway ) associated with one has not been associated with the other simply because one is acceptable and one is n't ; so it 's not the fact that a right has been taken away is wrong , its that you think X should have a right and that right has been taken away so you 're annoyed .
Incidentally ; if you 're white , female , black , communist , jewish , whatever ; you can still not get married if you 're gay .
If marriage is defined as a man and a woman then banning gay marriage is perfectly legitimate .
My point still stands @: if you need a certificate from the state to live your life in happiness then you are a . ) a pathetic individual and b . ) a serf .
So much for the change in America
When are people going to realise that sexual orientation , skin colour and ethnicity has no bearing on what is inside the person and their personality .
As long as you a good person , regardless of anything else then that is all that matters .
Shame on California - It shows what the real attitudes on homosexuality are .
People pretend to be fine with it - but their is ignorance deep inside .
What a sad day for "@ new @" America . It seems while racism is rightly widely condemned there is still a lot of Homophobia around .
The sad thing is not that many seem to care
Personally , I think they should have left it ( who cares about homosexuals getting married ? ) but it 's quite common in the US for things that become law by virtue of court decisions to later be subject to public vote .
This was one such case .
Gay marriage was never legislated for in California .
This proposition - approved by the public - trumps a court decision .
I was reading an article about how we need more black sold models for young black people to aspire to .
Because apparently , all young blacks in Britain need an extra reminder not to commit crimes and be involved in gangs .
This highlights a severely racist phenomenon that is considered completely acceptable .
That all these initiatives are exclusively targeting young black British people ( in attempt to curb the apparent swarms of exclusively black teenagers begging to be part of a gang ) while completely ignoring any other skin colour .
Now obviously not every black male wants to go committing crimes all day , and the evidence suggests that blacks like committing crimes just as little as other skin colours do .
So why the disproportionate representation in the media and in crime prevention strategies ?
Why does nobody care about crime in the east European , the Asian or ( god forbid ) the white community ?
Why is nobody saying how great a role model plan B is for all the young white kids growing up in council estates .
You can go anywhere in Britain and see that gang culture and criminals exist everywhere , in every ethnic group .
Logic would dictate that a white oriented initiative would make the most sense for demographic reasons .
Or how about something which does not base its case on skin colour and ethnic origin ?
Do people really think that a poor white teenager does n't need support , encouragement or aspiration ?
I completely agree with everything you 've said .
I also think it 's this ridiculous idea that crime in certain ethnic groups needs to be dealt with more urgently that causes more problems .
If the ethnicity and colour of those committing crimes was n't mentioned , it would be much less big a deal . Why this country feel the need to consistently talk about the colour of people is beyond me .
It 's like when we beg for Asian / black police officers .
If they do n't want to do it , they will n't .
We should be judged on our merits , not our skin colour .
I believe it 's things like this that make white people believe the country are going against them .
If the government did n't deal with things only to do with race , then I , perhaps naively and idealistically , believe that it would become less of a big deal .
In London , blacks commit a disproportionate amount of crimes .
Hence , why they 're targeted .
Most gangs in London are full of blacks .
Black role models give black people hope .
It 's not about whether it should or why does it , it just does because black community are a semi @-@ community .
Totally agree .
Poor white people ( pre 20 th century , just poor people ) have been discriminated against for hundreds of years in Britain .
Immigration happens and we 're suddenly part of the oppressing class ?
Growing up poor and white in a mostly non white school was horrible .
Having to learn about the evilness of white people repeatedly really does n't give white kids the impression that they have a place in our multicultural society .
The reason specific ethnic groups are targeted for trying to reduce crime is because , for whatever reason , crime overall is often higher statistically in these groups .
This is not because their race or culture is wrong or bad in any way , it 's simply a fact that certain groups have higher rates of crime .
Whether it 's the result of poverty or cultural differences and stresses in Britain that are leaving them vulnerable to getting lured into crime , pretending that a group that has more prevalence for crime has n't is just foolish .
I do n't know the statistics , but if black youths are the target of an anti @-@ crime and role @-@ model drive , then it 's probably because they have a higher crime rate than other groups , and because the government wants to make sure that whatever factor it is ( because we know it 's not their race itself ) is addressed so they can have a better future .
And there are schemes targeting white populations , but when there is an imbalance between ethnic groups , it surely has to be a priority to address what is causing this imbalance - if for nothing else then for the sake of equality !
There 's a lot of talk recently about how diversity is necessary , but how far do we go ?
And how do we judge what is a good and strong / positive multiracial country ?
When you look at other western countries like Canada , America , Australia , the vast majority of its immigrants are not white these days and are probably heading for a more diverse future , so much so to the point that these nations will have very different demographic look to them in 50 years time .
They will have great bragging rights you could say when it comes to multiracialism and diversity than Britain or most european countries will maybe not have .
You often here quotes like "@ Hollywood is too white @" "@ the tories are too white @" but what defines what is "@ too white @" ?
So I 'm wondering if people could put Britain in the same context ?
Like I say people brand multiracialism as a good thing , very few want to go back to a 100 % white society but how multiracial do we need to go to satisfy the vast majority of people , particularly liberals ?
I personally think it 's completely necessary but I know many of my opponents will disagree .
Are we still not multiracial enough compared to some of our western rivals ??
What do you think ??
Mate you are all confused .
When people say "@ the tories are too white @" or "@ hollywood is too white @"
what they MEAN is "@ The amount of white people in the tories are disproportionately represented compared to the british population @" .
I.e. 14 % of the british population is non @-@ white , but 14 % of the tories are not correspondingly non @-@ white .
There is a bias in representation .
This is bad because it means certain races are being excluded .
This is COMPLETELY different to asking whether an entire nations population should be a certain skin colour - skin colour should be irrelevant .
It 's absolutely sickening you would want to diminish a race 's presence just for the sake of it .
The question is pretty , well , questionable
I do n't know of many people who want diversity FOR DIVERSITY 'S SAKE .
The issue with places like "@ white @" hollywood is the glass ceiling that keeps minorities AND women out , as there is the feeling ( whether true or not ! ) that there is not a level and fair playing field .
Funny how people come up with imaginary arguments from the "@ other side @" , as I 've never HEARD any of these "@ liberals @" you refer to .
I think , as usual , you 're framing an argument in a way that will make your so called opinion look bad
If a memeber of your family was going an illegal activty would you conact the police about their actions ?
Obviously that depends on the activity .
I 'm not going to report my mate for driving at 80 on the motorway but if I suspected he was a serial killer I might be inclined to tell somebody
I do n't know if contacting the police would be the rationale approach .
I think I would personally confront that family memeber .
If i am unsuccessful i 'd get other family members to help and ultimately if they still refuse to listen -- i 'd leave them to their own accord and let them do what they believe is right or wrong .
Because at the end of the day , my conscious would be clear [ in the sense that i did try and help them ] .
Telling the police would not be wise , as you 'd be creating enemies .
It 'd depend what they were doing .
If I did n't think they were harming anyone ( smoking dope , illegally downloading music etc. ) then I would n't report them ; if they were hurting other people ( violent crime , theft from individuals etc. ) then I definitely would .
Same goes for anyone I was aware of committing a crime , tbh .
I would n't go '@ ooh , you 've murdered ten people with an axe , but you 're my mum so I will n't tell anyone @'
The main arguments i hear about this issue is that this country is '@ full @' or that there 's enough unemployment as it is .
What exactly makes people feel that British people deserve to remain in this country more than anyone else who just happens to have been born into poverty or war ?
Surely if we 're all equal then no matter where one 's born , they have equal rights to live in the UK as someone born here .
I 'm not against immigration but i think it should be more regulated .
Why ? Because immigration has already caused a lot of "@ social issues @" and until we solve those problems I do n't think its good to just let everyone in .
How should it work @: education of english , their intentions , and to what they will contribute and most importantly their ideologies and beliefs .
To those whom the welfare state is the biggest concern I think the problem arises from the fact that there are already too many english people sponging off the state and if we add anymore people be it immigrants or "@ britons @" our state of government would collapse and then our economy .
Because I wish to protect diversity .
If immigration levels are too high , the indigenous populations @' gene pool will eventually become so diluted to essentially be extinct .
The cultural and genetic distinctions that make the world a diverse , varied and interesting place will be lost , forever .
So that means that in contrast to the general population they are actually slightly under represented therefore the NHS does not rely on immigrants as much as leftie TSR users claim they do .
well certainly in london they are here .
but to be honest if you live in a village like manchester , anywhere in the south west of england , or anywhere as a matter of fact in the rest of the UK , all you will find are whites , but in london you will find ethnic people
besides this is from 2005 , I 'm pretty sure that the figures would be different now .
correct me if I 'm wrong .
The data is nearly 7 years old .
Your point that this shows that there are n't as many immigrants in the NHS as people think is surely not proven by that data - immigrants can be white e.g. immigrants from Italy or Poland would be counted under the white statistic .
All i see on TheStudentRoom these days is agitated non @-@ muslims interrogating muslims , criticising their religion ( as any sane person would ) , muslims signing up to the student room JUST to post some anti @-@ israel propaganda to persuade people about how evil israel is or how islam is the religion of peace
it seems that the blood libel rumour of medeival times that Jews kill christian babies to use their blood for wine is today in the form of zionists / jews / israelis killing palestinian babies just because theyre pure evil , and i think the islamic propaganda machine is succeeding in convincing people ?
anything which takes sides against muslims get a million negs - its obvious muslims are in a huge presence on TSR .
with a quarter of ALL primary school children from ethnic minorities ( mainly islamic ) is the race @-@ relations and religious demography of TheStudentRoom a sign of things to come on a National scale in Britain ?
From TSR to a National Scale is a pretty big jump do n't you think .
Also this is a forum where topics are going to be discussed and these are categorised e.g. religion .
So you have a choice in viewing these threads and not being part of this so called propaganda .
Also in my opinion there are more Atheists than Muslims on TSR .
And what has Jews , zionists and Palestine got to do with Islam ?
Finally "@ a quarter of all primary school children are Muslim @" .
i 've been threatened by countless of them on here .
generally they need positive feedback all the time , eithewise they get really aggressive .
most of them are racist in my opinion .
Agreed , if people want to be muslim - then fine .
But when it becomes their life objective to annoy the life out people with their "@ READ THE QUARAN - OR DIE !!! @" threads , it becomes a bit annoying -_-
Over the past 1 @-@ 2 years I 've had quite a few discussions with people about current affairs ( namely the issue of terrorism and the related issues of immigration , global politics etc. ) and quite often heard a common belief that a british civil war will erupt when ethnic minorities increase in numbers and become more estabished .
This beleif is common amonst certain white british nationalists etc. @..
I do n't believe this will ever happen for various reasons @....
Do any of you believe that a british / english civil war will take place ( on the basis of race / identity ) ?
If so , what do you predict / envisage ?
I believe it will happen ( something similar to what India has now to an Israel @-@ Palestine type thing ) .
What a ridiculous comparison .
How is it any different ?
The only difference is Palestine are still suffering injustice .
As the numbers of minority groups who do n't respect secular law increase they will demand greater autonomy , and mini @-@ vassal states will appear but still remain part of the UK ( like Palestine ) and things will get pretty tense .
So you reckon that first a large imperial power will rule the UK ( like the Ottomans ruled Palestine ) .
This imperial power will be defeated and then power will pass to another power ( like Palestine became a British mandate ) .
So you think that an entire group of people are going to move to the UK after a genocide , and then a state will be established , voted for and partitioned by the United Nations ?
You then think that neighbouring countries will then invade this new state , that the native British people will be forced to flee to like Cornwall ( Gaza ) and Yorkshire , Lincolnshire , Norfolk , Suffolk , Essex and a part of East London ( West Bank ) .
That these British people will form militant groups , that want to return to the former England .
That this new state will be supported by the USA who will provide it with diplomatic protection and weaponry ?
As I said , absolutely mental to transplant Israel / Palestine to the UK .
not sure how britain can call itself a civilised country when a woman is raped every 10 minutes .
for some people , civilisation seems to rest on how rapists are treated when in custody and not how many rapists actually exist .
i am disgusted by modern britain .
something needs to be done obviously the easiest way to stop rape is to deal with rapists a lot tougher and send out a clear message that it is not acceptable .
at the moment they are given on average 7 years in jail .
its a disgrace .
no other country in the history of the world has been so permissive towards criminals .
britain @: weak on crime , tough on the victims of crime .
On a serious note rapists should have longer sentences , I would be happy for them to spend their whole lives in prison if it 's beyond practically any doubt they raped someone
I do n't see how tougher prison sentences will prevent rapes from occurring .
The appellation of '@ rapist @' is stigmatising enough ; the scum who rape people clearly do n't care about the consequences .
The sentences rapists and paedophiles ae given are jokes .
Wow , people are so reactionary .
There are so many different types of rape , and situations , a single life sentance makes no sense .
It is a crime of massive degrees of difference , I think the mark of a good legal system is that it can deal with every individual crime , rather than simply handing out the same punishment ragrdless of the circumstance .
That said , we could be tougher on all criminals , not just rapists .
And , to put things into perspective , how often do women have consensual sex ?
What 's that ?
You do n't know ( ! )
Oh well nvm then @...
Bring back capital punishment .
Sorry to have to point out the bleeding obvious to the majority of you , but it seems like a minority of users actually have to be told this @: do not make troll posts or "@ jokes @" about rape , it is n't funny .
For rape ?
Are you for real ?
Not just rapists , overall perhaps ?
I 'm honestly shocked by that number , I would have thought it would be more than that .
Although that is just the number of reported rapes , which probably does n't even account for half .
What do you mean by that ?
Do you think it 's not one of the most serious crimes ?
I keep frequently seeing threads made hating on Islam , which is somewhat hypocritical and disturbing I believe in many cases .
I am an Atheist ; therefore I am not trying to defend Islam out of being '@ Islamic @' before I am accused of that .
I am also considered by British nationalists to be 100 % British ( Although I reject the idea that it makes a real difference ) , so I am not showing sympathy for Islam out of experiencing similar hostility or racism .
However , I do believe that Islam and Christianity , along with other major religions , all play very similar and negative roles in the world .
Therefore , I do not believe we should be cherry @-@ picking Islam as some specific evil , but rather opposing all religions for the extremely negative roles they play in the world .
The usual argument held against Islam is that it is responsible for terrorism .
This may be correct , but the fact of the matter is ; whether somebody is using Islam to commit terrible acts , regardless of the wrongdoing , all major religion play a large role in shaping societies , and ultimately , fulfil playing a very similar negative role .
And when using the idea that Islam ‘@ inspires terrorism @’ , if we were honestly that bothered about such wrong @-@ doing in the world , then we would surely be more concerned with ending the much more severe crisis 's and wrong @-@ doing 's such as starvation and war .
Both of these ills are far more widespread and important than the threat of terrorism , as of which we are more liking to die by our own hands rather than by the hand of an '@ Islamic terrorist @' .
It is almost unbelievable how the idea that a Christian should have any sympathy or support when they proclaim a dislike for Islam , when the religion they subscribe to right now in Britain , is playing a much more negative role .
We should oppose religion simply on the basis that all religion plays a negative role .
But we should not bully specific religions because of certain conditions and influences of the societies we presently live in .
This is of course , an argument only for those who aspire to reason , rationality and evidence in mind .
I have no expectation that I will be receive any support for my remarks by Christians or other adherents of major religions .
I am an atheist and I think Islam is the most inherently evil religion out of all the other ones .
I would choose to live in a christian society over a Muslim one any day .
As an atheist I can differentiate between Islam and Christianity , in that Christianity is progressive , whilst Islam is not .
Well to be honest it 's a two headed coin .
I completely agree sometimes , there is a horrendously bad labeling of Islam unnecessarily .
But sometimes it does no come under as much criticism ( for small cases , not the religions as a whole ) as other religions because people just get labelled racist .
I know everybody is gonna neg me as racist but someone has to say it .
Similarly to how not all claims are created equal , and individual claims require differing levels of evidence , neither are all religions created equal and it is rational to dislike a certain religion over another if one can be shown to be more detrimental to another .
So it is irrelevant that you believe all religion plays a negative role , even though I agree with you , because our priorities should be focused on those which are the most detrimental .
Would you honestly have us use the same resources in combating the negative effects of Islam and combating the negative effects of Jainism ?
I would also like you to back up your assertion that Christianity , which in this country is in a weak and almost laughable form , is playing a more negative role in Britain 's society than Islam is right now .
Also , reading your posts you appear to be a highly arrogant , self-righteous , and cocky person .
Your last sentence is almost cringe worthy in its self @-@ importance .
You 're 21 .
Time to get some humility and eat some humble pie , because I guarantee you 're going to be wrong on countless things throughout your life .
If you compare a traditionally Christian / Buddhist / whatever country to a traditionally Islamic country in terms of stability , equality , safety and crime , quality of life etc. , there 's a good chance the non @-@ Islamic one is going to come out on top ( there would likely be exceptions , but as a general rule . )
That is one reason why people perceive it to be worse for society .
And I do n't say this out of hate .
I 'm aware that most individual Muslims are friendly and civilised fellows .
We live in an age where celebrities are gods and fame is sought after above all else .
People go crazy when seeing celebrities , faint when they touch them and track their each and every movements via magazines , hell there 's a subforum dedicated to them on this site !
Why do we feel the need to elevate people to celebrity status and worship them ? I really do n't understand how this culture emerged and why .
Must have something to do with providing people with gods to worship and adore in an age in which gods have been killed . By doing so , I guess , many people are saved from nihilism as a result of the loss of values from the death of God . Thus , superstars and rockstars are put on a pedastal for people to look up to and aspire to be like . If we were living in ancient Rome , for example , the superstars and rockstars would be the heroic gladiators , but the best gladiators were often thought of as gods in their own right . They were supposedly treated like gods . Ceasar himself was worshipped as a god by the people . The gods of yestreday are the stars of today . When charles Atlas became famous they were saying he was a god . Great individuals are sometimes regarded as more than human by their fans . Fred Astair , Al Jolson , Charlie Chaplin , James Dean , Marlon Brando , Elvis , Sinatra , Bruce Lee , Bowie , Morrissey , boy bands like Take That , Lady Gaga and the like .
i think its disgusting that the death of a drink and drug adict got 15 separate articles on the bbc news website , and there was n't even a mention of the british soldier killed in the same week . people need to get priorities in order
I can n't recall hearing of this much before the riots of late , so I wonder whether it will become a regular crime from now on .
It does n't have to occur alongside a riot , but carefully planned and limited to a close circle , it could be a very lucractive crime .
If a circle of 10 @-@ 15 target a high-end retailer during a perfectly normal shopping day , perhaps at a strategic location and time , I do n't really see what could stop them from looting a shop with lots of valuable merchandise within proximity of the entrance e.g. luxury clothes shop .
if we made that number 100 / 200 it would be nearly impossible to stop them .
Are you trying to set something up or what ?
That 's different though , the riots were promoted like a chain letter , were n't they , rather than a plot between a few people who all actually knew each other , and therefore could be rounded up fairly easily .
And surely it 's just "@ looting @" because it was still associated with general civil unrest .
But people will see the footage of them carrying off luxury goods for nothing and even posing alongside plasmas .
They 'll get ideas .
Apparently it was in a multicultural office . My arse it was .
Even our own English people are n't even allowed to do anything because it will offend these immigrants @...
As richard dawkins says , "@ So what if youre offended ?
Im offended by backwards baseball caps and chewing gum , does n't mean im going to abolish it @"
Okay , i meant to say banned , not arrested .
Id like to make this clear , its not the muslims were having a go at , but the officials .
They received complaints ( could be muslims , we do n't know ) , and the officials said breastfeeding is offfensive to muslims .
Why did the officials ssay that ?
I think its because this country is afraid of muslims - suicide bombers , poppy burners , stoning people to death @.... you know the story .
These officials are saying its offensive because they want to go on the muslims good side and not make any enemies .
Islam is a bad religion .
In fact all religions are bad imo .
I think that 's a bit much .
It 's not up to Muslims if she breastfeeds her child her not .
Telling her to feed her baby in a toilet is also ridiculous .
Muslims are n't offended by breastfeeding , it is just the labour councillor of the multicultural office saying '@ it will offend them @'
People like this just end up creating arguments between 2 different religions / communities for no reason what so ever
You know what the problem is with this country ?
Our schools do n't teach critical thinking .
How much of a **** do you have to be to design a curriculum without critical thinking on it ?
If you can ban something somebody else does based on your faith , everybody else can ban things you do based on their faith .
If you want everybody else to use reasoning with you , you have to use reasoning with them .
How many of you support capital punishment ?
This is what I think @-
ARGUMENTS FOR @:
- Those who murder deserve to have the same done to them
- Can be a deterrent
- Justice for the victim 's family
- Cheaper than prisons
ARGUMENTS AGAINST @:
- The person killed could be innocent
- It 's inhumane and barbaric , the criminal may be able to be reformed
- It makes us just as bad as them
Ultimately , I really do n't know how I stand on this issue . Up until recently I was very much in favour of it . I 'd say that maybe it should be used in extreme circumstances but it 'd be difficult to know when not to execute someone .
Any comments ?
To be honest I 'm for it if it 's cheaper . Other than that , meh . I think being in isolation for years at a time would be worse than a quick death , although I 'm not sure .
But then , I 'm not sure if the Death Sentance would be cheaper , as you 'd have to have a mass of appeals and such like before hand .
I would n't support it for first time offenses , but when a criminal is given a second chance and reoffends , I 'm all for it @... I mean , if the evidence is 100 % conclusive that is , which is the case most of the time now with modern technology etc.
I was on a tour in Ireland last week when the operator on the bus asked where everyone was from .
As it happened I was the only British person on the bus , and when asked I said that I was from '@ England @' .
The guide then said , '@ no you 're not , you 're from the United Kingdom @' and started making a big deal out of it and I got quite embarrassed .
I was actually really angry at that though because I identify far more as English than I do as British .
When we were in the pub later on , two Argentinians also commented , saying that they did n't think it was right for him to say that , as you would n't expect a Scottish person to say that they were from the UK .
Is it only the English who are n't allowed this kind of pride in where they live ?
Personally I find it nonsensical to be proud of something you have n't chosen or done , but it 's up to you if you want to be proud where you come from .
I could n't care less really what my nationality was , it 's just letters on a passport ,
I still wonder what my identity is , a human being , a Brit , a European ?
No , I prefer to call myself a overgrown monkey .
You are allowed to state where you 're from .
That is n't pride . That 's just a statement of fact .
I do n't think there 's anything massively wrong to to feel a sentimental pride towards your country ,
it is human nature to feel attached to where you come from .
It is nationalism that becomes an issue .
His jumping down your throat was his problem .
You 're from the UK and England so in my opinion which ever one you choose to identify yourself as you are correct .
You 've probably guessed what this one 's about !
In the 2001 census , the question of what people 's religious affiliations were , and many people decided to put "@ Jedi @" in the hope that it would be recognised as an official religion .
It was n't . But 390,000 people decided tocall themselves Jedis anyway .
I 'm wondering what people make of this .
I kinda expected more Jedis to be out there , although in all honesty , I would say that I have n't actually seen anyone wielding a lightsaber , so that may be flawed .
I just thought that seven in every thousand people is a bit small , since the campaign was well @-@ publicised , and there were no repurcussions for not telling the truth on the religion question .
So what does everyone else make of it ?
I know quite a few Jews put down ''@ Jedi @'' on the census as they did n't want government records that they were Jewish - that 's how Hitler managed to find all the Jews so easily - it was all kept carefully on detailed and accurate notes .
It can be argued that it is none of the government 's concern as to where each Jew / Muslim / Sikh / Christian etc. lives @..
how would that affect GDP or the state of the economy ?
On the other hand it can be said that they should know who practices what as they run the country and can thus make laws according the proportionate numbers of each faith etc.
- As a Jew and having experienced anti @-@ Semtism myself ( as many Jews have and do ) I would sway towards the former view in terms of safety , but I can understand why people would disagree with this and choose the latter .
Earlier this month the results from the 2011 British Social Attitudes Survey were published by the government .
The main finding , as mentioned in the title , is that for the first time a full 50 % of British people no longer associate themselves with any religion , and over half of the people that do affiliate with a religion never attend religious services or meetings , with only 14 % attending such events on a weekly basis .
It 's dying . Good .
I do n't really care either way , to be honest .
All this really proves is that the question on the census needs rewording .
Nice to see that those lacking a religion are now a majority , although thankfully UK Christians tend to be very reserved and moderate unlike their US counterparts .
Though undoubtedly many of the responses on this thread will still use the 2001 census as a reliable source for religious demographics despite the fact it 's ten years old .
Good .
Will be interesting to compare this to the census data when it 's released .
I am regaining my faith in humanity .
America next .
America is probably a lost cause , but I 'm pleased to see we 're going Scandinavian .
This is n't intrinsically an anti @-@ islam thread .
Nor am I saying that other religions do n't have followers that do things that are similar and worse .
Today that 's not my focus .
Millions of lambs were ritually killed a short time ago .
Many Muslims making the claim that it was done in a way that is painless .
However , I 'm unsure of what is really going on .
Children were seen to be showing disrespect and a lack of caring .
Adults the same .
Even if you claim that animals and humans simply are n't equal , it does not justify harming them .
It would be like claim I am above someone else therefore I can do what I want to them .
It does n't make any sense .
This video shows the lambs , which appear to be in a great deal of pain , being killed .
My question is , how is that peaceful ?
Or justified ?
In this day and age in the western world it has become increasingly easy to be a vegan .
So why would you put animals intentionally through unnecessary pain and suffering ?
Graphic video in spoiler @:
2 minutes in you see a lamb killed .
6.44 what looks like salt is put over where the wound will be . Will this not worsen the pain ?
During the Hajj , Muslims remember and commemorate the trials and triumphs of the Prophet Abraham ( as ) .
The meat from the sacrifice of Eid al @-@ Adha is mostly given away to others although there is no limit to what may be eaten or given in charity or used to feed the poor or the rich or even if one wants to give it away cooked or uncooked .
Generally though , it is preferred that you give most of it in charity .
The method of slaughter is similar to the one used throughout the whole world , by Muslims and non @-@ Muslims .
There are probably many variants though but considering one method "@ worse @" than another is subjective .
The most important difference though is that in Islam , you are obligated to put the animal under as little pain as possible and to treat it humanely ( during the slaughter and every instant of it 's live before it ) .
Anyone who says halal ritual does not cause pain is a liar .
I have seen an animals throat slit and it survived and was in a lot of pain .
Ironically it was a pig that was being slaughtered .
I was in Cyprus and they slit its throat .
Before any Muslim says "@ it was n't done properly , @" do n't talk that crap .
The cut was so deep I was surprised it was n't fully decapitated .
However the pig squealed in agony and was still running until it bled out .
I 'm sorry but its all a load of crap "@ halal does n't cause pain @"
If you have a problem with the slaughter of animals , you should be vegetarian and disapprove of all slaughter , which I assume you are .
Why this has anything to do with Islam and a festival where lambs are slaughtered for the poor in memory of Ibrahim 's ( Abraham 's ) loyalty to God I do not see .
Oh and btw , a few years ago I was in a town near my home city in India with my family for qurbani - and literally the people there were starving and malnourished beyond belief .
To such people , the pain of an animal is the last thing on their mind .
I only mention because it is so easy to view things from a Western first world perspective , which is why we also criticise Chinese fur farms where furs are stripped from animals when they are alive causing unbelievable pain for incredibly long extended periods , but to a Chinese family in the remote rural regions , it is their only source of bread and butter - and trust me , these people who really do not know whether they will get another meal ( unlike the gluttony we engage in 24/7 since birth here in the West ) think very differently from us - and justifiably so .
The recent case of the Christian pastor in Iran has given me cause to ponder the question in the thread title .
Here we have a man who knows that his life is in great peril if he refuses to recant his Christian faith , yet that is exactly what he does .
It goes without saying that his bravery is truly commendable .
His possible martyrdom parallels that of the Apostles who evangelised in the knowledge that what they were doing would likely get them killed .
I often wonder if I would be so brave if I were in their shoes
I love God more than anything , but it 's impossible to imagine what kind of pressure the pastor in Iran is under .
Would you sacrifice yourself in defence of your faith ?
yes , without doubt , yes I will sacrifice myself in defence of my faith .
God did sacrifice Himself for us , so I thought it 's sensible for us to sacrifice ourselves for our religion .
Even if I was religious I doubt I would ever die for my religion .
Whats the point ?
Do you think it gets you an automatic ticket to heaven ?
Is it going to change the mind of the one who killed you ?
What about your family and friends ?
If someone holds a gun to your head and demmands you recant , just f***ing do it !!
It does n't mean anything , god is n't going to deny you access to heaven because you made a perfectly rational decision under intense pressure
I 've been watching some of his videos and I definitely think he has a right to criticize religion if he wants to .
But I find a lot of the time he makes such sweeping statements and sometimes unnecessary insults that annoy me .
What do you think of him and his videos ?
He 's a bit aggressive , raves and rants a lot , and mixes up a lot of different political stances into one bundle when many are in no way related , but beyond that @....
yeah , guy speaks a lot of truth .
Everytime when I watch him , I think to myself "@ Okay , we get it .
You hate Muslims .
And your point is @..@ ? @" .
Just spotted the thread about the Patterson film , and looking over at it they 're seems to be some people claiming to not only believe in bigfoot but claim to have seen one , not im not sure if this is sarcasm , but what the hell @....
anyone seen a real life sasquatch ?
I 've seen an actual photograph of an actual person in an actual Bigfoot costume .
Does that count ?
For any who were n't already aware Huntster believes he came upon a sasquatch trackway and I while camping with friends on Vancouver Island several years ago found two sets of tracks and had a close range audio encounter with what at the time I attributed to sasquatch ( es @- at the time I thought there was an adult and juvenile ) but now I discount the event as inconclusive and likely mistaken identity given the spurious nature of BF evidence .
However , I still fel pretty confident I could rule out hoaxing because of the remoteness of the area .
But hey , you never know @...
I actually surfed in after a year because I wanted to hear the JREF side on this issue . No one appears to have posted about this yet .
Apparently , the two folks that died paid nearly 10,000 dollars to attend the new age sweat led by two time Oprah guest .
James Arthur Ray - a non @-@ Native American , lead over 60 people into the sweat '@ lodge @' .
20 people became ill , and one more is still in critical condition tonight .
I just read about this story .
It 's a tragedy , and I also find it revealing that the New Age guru in question , Mr. Ray , has since left the state of Arizona .
From what I understand , it sounds like Ray did n't know what the hell he was doing , because he put entirely too many people in entirely too small a space .
In addition , they covered the lodge with materials that did n't allow for decent air flow .
Put all of that together , and you have a situation ripe for asphyxiation .
Apparently they are still wanting to question the guy .
They said he was uncooperative .
I do n't know much about the laws on this but would n't it be negligent homicide or something ?
This would be an interesting story to keep up with .
I have been searching for this story to no avail .
A few weeks ago me and a few friends watched a TV show on Discovery ( their house not mine ! ) where a guy claims to have recovered from a coma with a newfound ability @...
he can play the piano like an expert .
He says he can n't write music , but he sees musical notes in his mind and he can "@ miraculously @" play them seemingly perfect , or close to it .
He claims to have no musical training and has never played an instrument in his life .
My B.S. meter went off , of course .
Does anyone here have more information about this guy ?
I can n't remember his name @...@ I think he is in the U.S.
I can n't find anything on the web or here at JREF .
For musicians @: I wonder how he would handle key signatures since he says the notes just fly by in his mind .
Are they notated as sharp or flat ?
Or is he stuck in C major forever ?
My off the cuff guess is that he played the piano before the coma .
Perhaps he is a failed musician and saw an opportunity to get into the limelight .
I would think people in his life would know that he could play previously , but as we all know , believers will n't care , or simply claim that these people are lying .
The ability to play the Piano and other instruments to a high level not only involves technical ability but also physical training ( remember the first time you tried to span notes on a Guitar or piano ? )
How is it possible he woke with all his Piano playing muscles fully developed ?
Well in the case of the guy Sacks writes about , it was more a matter of waking up to a newfound passion for the piano , not that he woke a fully developed piano player .
He claims to have been a guy who listened to rock music before the accident , but afterward could n't get enough of piano music , started to sit down at a piano to play , and then more and more often , and then he was hearing music in his head , and it just became an obsession .
So nothing really mystical about it . The man himself seems to put a spiritual spin on it , but it makes sense all the same without it .
I 'd say it 's not impossible .
He seems to be playing by ear .
His music is unstructured ; it sounds like he 's just playing whatever comes into his head .
He 's not playing classical works like Mozart .
Also , I 'd say he 's self @-@ taught at the very least .
Watch his hands .
He does n't hold them in the typical positions that most piano players are taught .
He looks like he 's just stabbing at the next note he wants to play .
It has been noted that there have been a lot of threads created on the topic of global warming .
A great number of these topics rapidly descend into bickering and other rule violations .
Although one of the biggest threads was put on moderated status , it seems that many of the other threads have sprung up in order to avoid moderated status .
That thread has now been closed .
Since many of the threads cover the same or similar ground , we 've decided to keep only this thread for general Global Warming discussions , which will be moderated .
Unless the topic is very different from the "@ general @" discussion , new threads and posts about global warming will be moved to that thread if they satisfy the membership agreement .
Failure to confine general discussions to this moderated thread or starting other threads for general discussion will be treated as Rule 6 violations and subject to a series of escalating penalties just like any other membership violation .
We hope this will encourage civility in the discussion of global warming .
We realize this topic inspires strong emotion , but please contain your emotion to those forms which are permissible under the Membership Agreement .
I do n't know if you guys have followed potholer54 's channel on youtube , but his series of delightfully devastating and withering videos on climate science and creationism are something to behold .
The latest in the series looks at the "@ scientists @" that represent the denialist side in the climate "@ debate @"
I 'm aware of realclimate.org , have read a few articles and what not over the last few months .
The response was of course tongue and cheek , a commentary on the nonsense that you can n't have a meaningful discussion without hot links .
Hoepfully this new thread will promote just such discussions .
I do n't see how , short of turning to nuclear entirely , how we can reduce CO2 levels without sequestering and GE .
Not only that , but if you believe the current models to be accurate , we need to reduce the effects of CO2 now .
So this could have been in the science , music , or current events forum and if any mods should choose to move it , that will be fine with me .
I 'm watching the Grammys and they 've put on a tribute to Glenn Campbell including Campbell singing Rhinestone Cowboy .
And in the tribute they announce he has Alzheimer 's .
It amazes me that people are being diagnosed when they still have enough thought capacity to discuss their fate .
Being rich , I hope he gets to try the new treatment recently successfully used on mice .
I would .
It 's a drug currently approved for chemotherapy in humans .
This will be remarkable if it pans out .
So why did I post this and make it about Glenn Campbell instead of just about the science ?
I do n't know .
It just struck me hearing the announcement Campbell had Alzheimer 's at the same time he was still well enough to appear on stage at the Grammy 's .
It 's weird .
And the discovery of a treatment that is a drug already approved for use in humans should make a bit different of a pathway for research .
If you were wealthy or simply had access to the drug , and had Alzheimer 's would you use it immediately instead of waiting for conclusive studies ?
I had this discussion with Linda ( fls ) in the past and I really wish she had n't left the forum because i 'd like to use this example to revisit the discussion .
I can n't speak for her but I got the impression she would wait for the research to be more conclusive .
I use the criteria @: if it is not harmful and there is some evidence it might work , and if there is no better alternative , I think it is worth trying .
In this case it is the potential benefit and lack of any alternative treatment and the fact Alzheimer 's is such a devastating terminal disease that it outweighs the fact the research is premature .
What say the rest of you ?
I 'd do it in a heartbeat .
Our brain is who we are , and without memories we are just animals .
You risk almost nothing , to gain everything .
My feeling is that when I grow old enough that I 've "@ had a good run , @" why not donate my body to science before I die ?
If I have some disease that will kill me in a few months or years anyway , then , by all means , experiment on me with some new drug that has potential .
And if I have some issue that will n't kill me for awhile , well , what the hell if the new drug causes some side effects ?
I can always stop taking it .
Either way , there is some chance that I 'll help people younger than I am .
And once I die , then take my body and do whatever is useful with it .
I do n't need it anymore .
I am my mind .
At age 72 , with the possibility of Alzheimer 's looming in my future , I would take any supplement or drug -- experimental or otherwise -- that may prevent or delay this dreaded condition .
Obviously I would avoid anything demonstrably and seriously harmful .
Many conjectures like NSAIDs , simvastatin , fish oil have come and gone .
I have and will continue to try them all until they are proven ineffective or seriously harmful .
Precious little news on developments .
Last I saw Russian scientists were saying that they may have reached the surface .
I am frankly about as interested in this as is humanly possible .
Though I expect that little will be found outside of micro @-@ organisms , I have hopes that there will be discoveries similar to those around the black smokers .
My kids are hoping for Cthulhu .
They may have to wait until after Xmas .
A bit of an anticlimax considering the conversation we had on the subject last year ,
Much more gripping than this thread mate !
The huge interconnected lakes about two miles below antarctic ice can n't be touched because they must be under enormous pressure .
I would think that to drill into them would cause a collapse of hundreds of miles of ice , erupting water , flooding and wiping out area the size of Victoria ?
As is usual at JREF , much hilarity and education then ensued @...
Anxiety and inattention over Tokyo 's next Big One
It points out that a magnitude 7 earthquake is actually 1000 times smaller in terms of energy released that the magnitude 9.0 earthquake that caused the tsunami last year .
However , the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 which killed over 100,000 was a 7.9 .
And , I 'm pretty sure they do n't mean that this earthquake will be exactly magnitude 7 .
It could be bigger .
Still , I think that Tokyo is more earthquake @-@ resistant today than it was in 1923 .
So , I guess I 'll take my chances .
Take your chances ? !
What do you live in Tokyo ?
Curious @...@ do other Earthquake agencies agree with the data from Tokyo ?
I would like to know what scale they 're using , because different seismic scales can result in enormously different results .
A perfect example is the two largest Christchurch earthquakes .
The first was M7+ but did only minor damage and caused no fatalities due to a low Mercalli Intensity reading ( actual measure of intensity of shaking in a particular place ) .
The second M 6.3 quake registered at X ( Intense ) and higher on the Mercalli Intensity scale and had the highest peak ground acceleration ever recorded .
Many seismologists have said that the quake would have completely flattened almost any city in the world .
In terms of energy released , the deadly Christchurch quake was not particularly big , but in terms of shaking intensity it was one of the most destructive quakes ever recorded .
Japan 's "@ Shindo @" scale is like the Mercalli Intensity Scale , but does n't have anywhere near as many divisions .
The highest category is 7 which seems to equate with VIII on the Mercalli scale ( it goes up to XII ) .
This basically means a Scale 7 quake could be anything from a decently sized but not overly destructive quake right up to a city @-@ leveling event .
I heard this term for a single world currency .
Why is it that CTs seem to think this is a threat ?
We can n't even get 2.5 political parties to agree on fundamental economic principles .
There 's no reason to believe that we could get the US , Mexico and Canada to ever agree on a common currency .
Plus , the Euro zone is showing strains around the edges , so now would be a very bad time to try .
So why do you guys think the US invaded Iraq and Afghanistan ?
Do you think our leaders really thought Iraq had WMD ?
And do you think they actually cared ?
Who benefited from the war ?
Which industries , which money / power interests , which lobbying groups , etc. ?
Why is the US posturing so strongly against Iran ?
Are they really concerned about WMDs ?
What would Iran do with WMDs that would scare the US so much ?
Iran taking great control and spreading rebellion against US ?
Regional arms race ?
Iran using the bomb ?
America had been toying with the idea of "@ revisiting @" Iraq ever since the first war ended , particularly in 1998 , when Saddam first started getting coy with the inspectors .
It did n't get much traction then because America was , at the time , experiencing a resurgance of isolation after the end of the Cold War .
The issues were the same then , but Bush found the post @-@ 9 / 11 America a bit more ameniable to the idea of war .
Oil , WMDs , Al Queda , these were all simply McGuffins .
The real reason is that Saddam was a petty dictator who weilded an inordinate amount of influence and was continually giving the impression that he was Up To Something .
Whether he actually was or not was n't the point .
Be careful of special interest groups hijacking the message .
That 's what happened to the Tea Party leading them to be co @-@ opted into the Fox News GOP .
Even if people show up who you agree with on some political issue , ask yourselves if that issue is actually related to what the protest is about .
There will be , and probably already are , many factions who want nothing more than to turn the entire movement into a DNC fundraiser .
Suddenly it will be about collective bargaining for teachers or something else that does n't involve a corporation at all , let alone Wall Street .
The partisans on both sides will try and expand their trenches such that your movement falls into them .
Keep an eye out , do n't be the next Tea Party .
What identity ?
It 's a collection of every wingnut cause out there , from Ron Paultards to communists to anarchists to anti @-@ Israel to people who like to dress as zombies .
They want more government , less government , more immigration , protectionism , etc. etc.
They protest corporations even as they organize on Facebook and Twitter and Youtube using laptop computers and smart phones , all fruits of corporations .
They rail against oil companies while powering generators with gasoline .
They want to end capitalism , while also getting better pay .
What entity will pay them absent capitalism I have no idea .
Kids throwing a temper tantrum , basically .
They interviewed some of them on NPR the other day .
One guy admitted they did n't have a cohesive message and he was n't sure if they could have one considering the disparate groups that were there .
He also acknowledged the irony of using large corporations like Verizon to get the message out and using the McDonalds to go to the bathroom .
The New York Times printed an opinion piece by a Mr Eric X. Lee which asserts China 's political system is superior to Americas .
I do n't know if they though they were being edgy , but that 's a pretty stupid thing to print .
What next ?
Islamic attitudes to women superior to the West 's ?
You think people should only print that which toes the party line ?
Why was it a "@ stupid thing to print @" - opinion pieces as far as I know are meant to be opinions and it may surprise some folk but not everyone holds the same opinions as they do .
Given that news papers often print opinion pieces to raise interest in their title it seems that it is far from being a pretty stupid thing to print as we are talking about the newspaper @...
Yeah , your thread title rather gives a misleading opinion about the NYT Virus .
I 'm sure that was a complete accident of course .
I hear all sorts of perspectives on marriage . Those who think monogamy is the proper standard , those who think monogamy is a tool used to oppress women , those who think that polygamy is terrible , those who think that polygamy is natural , etc.
But virtually ever culture in the world has some form of marriage @...@ a concept in which a life @-@ long union is idealized , where there are formal ceremonies to '@ sanctify @' a man and a woman ( or multiples thereof ) . Cultures where , from childhood , children are raised and taught these ideals to the point where most of us think it is a natural part of human nature .
The FORM of marriage may differ from culture to culture , but it is consistent throughout our cultures .
That is , except for at least one very unique culture , the Mosuo , a Chinese minority group who live in the Himalayan mountains , close to the border with Tibet .
Two years ago , I established a non @-@ profit organization to work with the Mosuo , focusing on a variety of aspects ( education , development , etc. ) , but also on promoting awareness of their culture , and to trying to preserve it .
In the Mosuo culture , there is no marriage .
No marriage ceremonies exist .
There is no expectation whatsoever of life @-@ time bonds or pairings .
Children are raised not only without an expectation of spending their life with that one special person , but they often do n't even know ( or care ) who their biological father is .
In the Mosuo culture , men and women can change and choose partners as they please .
Monogamy is not considered special or even particularly desirable .
The Mosuo live in large extended families , with many generations ( grandparents , parents , children , grandchildren , etc. ) all living together in the same house .
Men sleep in communal sleeping rooms ( they do n't have private bedrooms ) ; only the women have the luxury of a private bedroom .
Thus , women tend to the the ones in control of relationships .
Traditionally , a Mosuo woman will invite a man to spend the night with her .
The man will come to her home at night , sneaking in through her window ( it is also a part of the Mosuo culture that , while everyone knows this is happening , it should be done in a manner that is not obvious ) , spending the night , and then leaving early the next morning before everyone wakes up .
Thus the term "@ walking marriage @" @...@ because the men must walk to and from their assigned rendevous each night .
The Mosuo walking marriages are generally the most interesting -- and misunderstood -- aspects of Mosuo culture .
People are always fascinated by it , but misunderstandings and misperceptions abound .
One of the most common misperceptions is that the Mosuo are very promiscuous , changing partners all the time .
That is patently not true ; in fact , many Mosuo pairing will last for years , and even decades .
There is no social stigma if someone DOES change partners often , but it is more common for the Mosuo to engage in what has been described as "@ serial monogamy @" @...@ that is , they do n't stick with one partner for their whole life , but each pairing will tend to last for an extended period , and they will n't generally have multiple partners while in a relationship .
However , there are fascinating and very unique aspects of these walking marriages .
First , even among couples who are together for months / years / decades , they generally will never actually live together , or share property .
The man will continue to live in his family 's home , and his responsibilities are to that family ; while the woman will continue to live her her home , and be responsible to her family .
The man will visit her at night , but the rest of the time they generally live separate lives .
And what if they have a baby ? In general , fathers have little or no responsibility for children produced from such unions ;
the baby will be raised in the mother 's home , and be a part of her family , not the father 's .
However , that does not mean that the men have no responsibility @...@ it is just that the focus of that responsibility is shifted .
In most cultures , a man will be responsible to care for his own children ;
in Mosuo culture , a man is responsible to care for the children of his sisters / nieces / aunts / etc. So Mosuo men still have full parenting responsibilities @...@ perhaps even moreso , since they may end up sharing responsibility for the children of many family members .
Now , in some cases , Mosuo men DO want to be involved in their own childrens @' upbringing .
If that is the case , after the child is born , the father will go to the mother 's home , and present the family matriarch with gifts , asking to be accepted as the father .
If the matriarch accepts him , he is then an '@ honorary member @' of the family , and has the right to visit and / or stay there like any other family member , and to help raise the child .
However , this is not a frequent practice .
Although this sounds very strange at first , it actually provides remarkable stability for the children .
First , they are not raised by just one parent ; everyone in the family shares in parental duties , so the child really ends up having multiple father and mother figures .
Furthermore , if the mother and father end their relationship , there is virtually no impact or stress for the child .
There 's no fighting over splitting property , because they never shared property .
There 's no fighting over custody of the child , because the child never belonged to the father to begin with .
The mother 's relationships with different men may change , but it has little or no effect on the children .
One more thing I 'd like to point out . While this system actually works very effectively for the Mosuo , it works ONLY in a situation where there is a large extended family to provide support .
For those Mosuo men and women who leave home to live / work on their own in other cities , they almost always choose more traditional marriage .
After all , caring for a baby without its father when you have 20 other people in your home to help you is one thing ;
caring for a baby without its father when you live by yourself is another matter entirely .
For more information about the Mosuo , their culture , and our work with them , you can check out our organization 's website . And I welcome questions and comments about this , or other aspects of Mosuo culture .
While their way of life holds no particular allure to me ( my job consists of sitting , writing on paper and thinking about things , I am allergic to horses , my greatest joy is my western traditional family of my wife and 2 daughters ) I applaud your efforts to provide as unobtrusive assistance to these people as possible .
Diversity of cultures and thinking is a Good Thing , and I like your organizations emphasis on putting them in control .
I would suggest that you do n't worry about people who suggest that you try to protect them somehow from the outside world .
If the Mosuo do n't want you or your organization 's help , I am sure they are quite capable of telling you to get lost .
When you say "@ we @" are doing this , who is "@ we @" ?
In particular , have you hooked up with the various groups like the LSA and the Endangered Languages Foundation ?
There 's a lot -- well , by linguistics standards , a lot -- of money floating around for doing exactly this , and it sounds like Mosuo is one language that might be saveable if you can bring it to the attention of the appropriate professionals .
So depending upon who the linguists you are bringing in are , it may be possible / practical to get some real heavyweights to come in for their support @....
Wolfman , sounds like you 're doing some amazing work !
The Mosuo sound like a fascinating people .
Matrilineal systems are indeed rather rare .
I think there used to be ( ) some in Polynesia .
I do n't know if property was owned by females but it was transferred through the female line ( a man 's heirs would be his sister 's children ) .
I think some of the Native American tribes in the U.S. plains were also matrilineal .
Very interesting . What this shows , I think , is that while there is no marriage , there is also no illegitimacy -- that is , most children ( a ) know who their fathers are ( and the fathers do not deny it , even if they have no role in caring for them ) and ( b ) have two male and female adults ( mother and her brother ) take care of them .
Also , it 's easy to see why this social arrangement will discourage promiscuity .
In general , most men will be responsible for raising , roughly , the same number of children as they have , even if they do n't raise their own children .
However , if you are a man who has too many partners -- or , more important , too many children -- you are probably seen as a freeloader @: someone who makes society take care of their many children while only caring for a few of society 's children in return .
Am I correct here ?
You 're the expert , I 'm just making an educated ( ? ) guess .

I 've enabled multiple choice for this poll because I 'd like you to select which 3 candidates will finish in the top 3 in New Hampshire .
The New Hampshire primary is just 5 days away .
In the average of the last 4 polls there it looks like this @:
Romney 40 %
Paul 19 %
Gingrich 11 %
Huntsman 10 %
Santorum 4 %
Perry 2 %
In two of the more recent polls , between 35 @-@ 40 % of NH voters say they are either "@ likely to change their mind @" or "@ undecided / uncommitted @" .
What are your vote predictions for next Tuesday ?
I 'm gonna ramble a bit and then reveal mine .
The consensus appears to be that Mitt Romney needs a big win in NH in order to propel him in SC since his Iowa result was almost to the vote the same total as 2008 .
No new support for Mitt .
In '@ 08 , Mitt finished 2 nd to McCain in NH and got 32 % of the vote .
How much of that 40 % right now is hardcore Romney support ?
Inexplicably , he avoided an onslaught of attacks over the last few weeks as the focus turned on Newt , but now one of the big questions becomes about what Republicans really think about the idea of Mitt cleaning up in NH and quite possibly everywhere else , too .
I think NH is a test of how comfortable or not Republicans are with Mitt as the presumptive front @-@ runner .
I think that like Iowa , he 'll hold on to the support in NH he got last time .
So he 'll come down to earth a little bit but will n't totally implode there .
Everybody needs to see the Iowa speeches .
Newt 's was fiery and disgruntled .
He 's so much more interesting when he 's an attack dog and he is positioning himself now as wanting to be the fullback to Rick Santorum ; if he 's going down , he wants to take Romney with him , and in the meantime that 'll let Santorum have a positive week and float above the fray .
Rick Santorum is leaving evangelical country and going into a 60 % Catholic state .
Between hard right establishment Catholics there and that close to 40 % undecided number , Santorum should be able to get into double digits .
But how high does he go ?
I think if Mitt comes down to the low 30 's and it appears that Santorum keeps coming up and can crack 25 % again , it 'll be another soft @-@ boiled Mitt non @-@ win win .
If Newt and Santorum now represent the more traditional GOP establishment and are fighting over that share in NH , Ron Paul and John Huntsman are sharing the Independent vote .
Will Huntsman be NH 's Santorum ?
Ron Paul appears ready to keep cruising around 20 % and another top 3 finish .
Rick Perry is totally insignificant and should have quit along with Michele Bachmann .
Romney 's ahead by an average of 21 % .
That 's going to come down to earth , but how much , and how much before it 's perceived that he 's falling and somebody else is rising ?
I think the threshold is that he needs to win by 10 % in order to gain any kind of traction as the front @-@ runner .
In Iowa , my predictions ( actual results in parenthesis ) were pretty close @:
Santorum 27 % ( 25 )
Romney 26 % ( 25 )
Paul 22 % ( 22 )
Gingrich 9 % ( 13 )
Perry 8 % ( 10 )
Bachmann 5 % ( 5 )
That was with a day or so out .
This is more of a crapshoot at this point but here goes .
Romney 32 %
Santorum 25 %
Paul 21 %
Huntsman 11 %
Perry 1 %
I 'm thinking it 's going to be Romney and Paul with a considerable lead , and Gingrich a distant third .
I would be distinctly and pleasantly surprised if Huntsman made the top three and absolutely tickled pink if he won , but I do n't see it happening .
Huntsman 's going to have to get some notice at the debate to finish in the top 3 .
If the others are attacking themselves like children , than maybe he can come up the middle and seem like the adult in the room and then NH will make a statement by elevating him to the anti @-@ Romney surging candidate in that state .
I feel like it 's going to be tough for him to break out .
You are probably right , Romney and Paul for sure , but once the light shines on Santorum , the NH voters are n't going to like what they see .
I still see three voting blocks , Romney , Paul and Someone Else .
Huntsman has n't had a turn being Someone Else yet , and he 's more appealing to NH voters than Santorum .
Romney by a big number , because he lives in NH in a palatial home on Lake Winnipesaukee , and he 's been working on this primary for 5 years .
Paul because he 'll draw a lot of independent voters , and I think Gingrich is fading along with Perry .
This is all going down to how much the anti @-@ Romney vote starts to close the divide .
In the Suffolk poll for Wednesday , it was Romney 43 % and Santorum 6 % .
Today it 's a two @-@ day total now of 41 % to 8 % .
From a 37 point gap to a 33 point gap . Now , if it 's 37 points after one day , but the two @-@ day total is 33 , that means the second @-@ day stand alone would be 39 to 10 , a 29 point gap .
Meanwhile , Huntsman is down in the two @-@ day total back to single digits .
Santorum 's small bump so far has costed Newt the most .
Watch for him to hit the double digits in the next couple polls .
Ron Paul is sailing with his strong 20 % .
I think the video below from a Charlie Chaplin movie is one of the best pieces that could be superimposed and run as a Ron Paul ad .
I would love to see something like this run on national television .
It 's a preaching to the choir ad .
It has no place on television because it does n't speak to the undecideds .
Near the end you could replace the "@ Ron Paul @" chants with any other candidate and it would have the same effect .
There 's nothing in it that speaks of Paul 's views or intended policies .
Lastly , negative ads are far more effective than positive ones .
1940 . And still is relevent today .
The ideal Chaplin espouses here , will never die , and only get pushed back , to arise again .
Humanity can indeed be thankful for that , that we only go through stages of insanity , and have the chance of overcoming that .
This SHOULD be an ad for Obama .
But he would have to cut his ties to the greedy .
His ties to the ones behind the curtain , calling the shots .
Yet this thread is about Paul , so never mind .
I keep hearing tons of people run off at the mouth about how dangerous Ron Paul 's foreign policies are and how they are out of touch with the real world .
The problem is that all the people who would be considered experts , and even Israel itself ( in regards to Iran ) , agree with Paul .
I 've been on two deployments and my job is an Arabic linguist of 10 years .
I 'm fairly knowledgeable about how the culture works in that part of the world , as is many of the experts .
Our interference does , indeed , cause more problems for us than what we are trying to stop .
We supported the rebels in Egypt and it 's now being taken over by radicals .
Who knows where Libya is going to end up .
Anyways , are all the experts kooky as well ?
I find that the Judge is actually one of a few mainstream conservatives that has a shred of honesty and actually understand what conservatism is .
If someone had only bombed the reactors in Israel and South Africa , while the US and other countries had prosecuted and imprisoned all the traitors who leaked nuclear weapons information and gave the necessary technology to them @...
The US is largely directly to blame for the proliferation of nuclear weapons through its "@ Atoms for Peace @" program .
But back on topic , if Ron Paul is "@ kooky @" then so are most other politicians in any country on the planet .
And that is certainly true with most of our supposed allies .
911 was blowback from us sticking our nose in business that is not our business .
With that said , I still want to kill anyone who is responsible in the planning , or anyone who shields these people .
No one in the right mind would think the attackers just did it for shits and giggles .
They thought they had valid reasons to attack us . And perhaps they did .
America is not perfect .
They were hoping to wound us gravely by attacking our financial system . A weak link in our chain .
They should have just saved those lives , because we allowed banking to fuck our system up greater than AQ could have ever done .
Leave it up to us , to be our worst enemy .
I think that a lot of people automatically assume that anyone who says our foreign policy is why they are angry at us is also justifying their response .
It is understandable they are upset , but neither Ron Paul nor anyone else who is supporting him is saying their response was in any way justified .
Indiscriminately targeting women and children is cowardly and people who do that should be captured or killed .
I really am tired of hearing that they hate us because we are free or because of our beliefs .
It would be like you building a shack in my backyard and every now and then one of my dogs goes missing , then when I get upset that it is there you say I am mad because you have bacon burger Fridays in your own house back on your property and I hate bacon ( which is clearly only a hypothetical as I love bacon ) .
Why ? Because experts do n't agree with him on his kooky policy stands , which are manifold @:
*@ denounces the Civil Rights Act because it infringed the free @-@ market right of a monolithic white establishment to immiserate blacks ;
*@ dabbles in gold buggery and advocates the elimination of the Federal Reserve , apparently because the global economy worked so well back in the era before central banks ( that 's called sarcasm ) ;
*@ suggests that the border fence is being built to keep Americans from leaving the country ;
*@ claims that Social Security and Medicare are unconstitutional and should be dismantled ;
*@ mounts repeated warnings that hyperinflation is right around the corner ( tsquare , take a bow ) ;
*@ insists that global warming is a gigantic hoax ( yes , Rush Limbaugh knows more about global climate science than NASA ;
*@ hinted that maybe the CIA helped to coordinate the 9 / 11 attacks ;
*@ opposes government @-@ sponsored flu shots ;
*@ and alleges that the UN wants to confiscate our guns .
( list adapted from th is blog )
And this list does n't even get into all the racism and homophobia of his newsletters , which used his name , were signed by him and which raised thousands of dollars which he was happy to pocket but have been disavowed by him now that they are a liability .
Note that none of this lists mentions our relations with Iran .
There 's lots of kookiness without having to go there .
Are you a communist ?
My friend and I walked into a pizza shop .
It was $ 3 a slice .
They had a special , a 12 @-@ slice for $ 10 .
If we both got two slices each , that would make it 4 slices at a total of $ 12 .
We were assured the slices in the 12 @-@ slice were the same size , so we got that .
We each pitched in $ 5 each ( which can n't even buy you two slices oddly enough ) and got 6 slices each , which we 've just polished off in fairly record time .
We pooled our resources and struck the better deal for the both of us , and we actually made a joke about proud and full communists .
Now we 're rolling a joint from a bag of weed we each pitched in on in order to save money as well .
Got our usual amount of weed each , but each paid $ 5 less because one of us did the transaction and bought twice as much as usual for the individual .
If these things make me a communist , than I 'll drink to that , but I just call it better business sense mostly .
Real communism would be they could go get a pizza without paying at all , and the pizza guy could come by their auto @-@ parts place to pick up a distributor cap without paying at all .
Real communism only exists in Israel 's Kibbutzes though .
The problem you are having Jason Marcel is that it is impossible for many people , and especially people in America , to conceive of cooperation and sacrifice without force behind it .
They are so locked into their little me @-@ centric universes that they can n't see cooperating with someone else unless someone makes them .
Seriously , I think the problem here is that a lot of people in the U.S. , conservatives especially , when they hear the word "@ communism @" think of the Soviet Union .
Not only was the Soviet Union not communist , it did n't even pretend to be .
The word refers in Marxist theory only to the end stage of social progress , what a socialist state and economy evolve into @: a stateless utopia in which everything is shared equally .
When communism is reached , socialism is no more , because socialism presumes the existence of the state , and under communism there is no state .
The motto under socialism is "@ from each according to his ability , to each according to his WORK . @" Under communism , it 's the more @-@ familiar , "@ from each according to his ability , to each according to his NEED . @"
The Soviet Union was socialist .
It never pretended to be communist , even though it was governed by something called the Communist Party .
Communism was what they were in theory evolving towards , but certainly not what they already had .
Communism is not a coercive system ; it 's the exact opposite .
Neither the private coercion of capitalism , nor the state coercion of socialism is found in a communist society .
If it were possible to have a communist society , it would be a wonderful thing .
EDIT @: I answered "@ no @" to the poll , because although communism is a beautiful dream , I consider it no more than that .
What do you guys think about a Ron Paul run for president in 2012 .
Though he 's kind of old , he is still sharp and incredibly intelligent - and consistent .
His voting record is very consistent and he does n't vote for any legislation that is n't expressly allowed by the Constitution .
Given this , the grassroots support he had in 2008 , and the fact that his message is very closely aligned with that of the tea party movement , do think he could head either a tea party ( or more likely ) GOP ticket .
I really think given Paul 's astoundingly consistent message and voting record ( and reputation ) that he could mount a serious challenge to Obama . W
hat do you guys think ?
The role of leader of the free world is not well filled by an isolationist .
Paul / Palin , has a nice ring to it .
Once again the Republican solution is a geriatric nut , only this time it 's a relgious fanatic instead of senile warmonger .
I wonder , will Hillary be too old in 2016 ?
Hillary will n't be "@ too old @" in 2016 , but she will still be too Hillary .
Habemus Papademos !
Finally after days of intense political infight in Athens the new prime minister seems to be the biggest favourite for the job @: Lucas Papademos .
He is an ex @-@ ECB vice president .
But foremost he is not a career politician as his profession is actually an academic one , partly in the US where he also studied .
Papademos seems to be well respected in the EU but also within Greece , as far as a Greek Prime minister could be respected in a country like Greece where being politician has a worse reputation than being a bank robber .
I am positively surprised about this choice .
At least someone took over who has an understanding of economics in quite some detail and is not from the old political class .
I do n't think one could have hoped for anything better than that .
On another note . There are rumors that Mario Monti could become the next prime minister of Italy .
Monti , also dubbed "@ Super Mario @" , is a former EU commissioner and will still ring some bells for example in Redmond , simply because it was him who did not shy away from taking a fight with an extreme heavyweight like Microsoft over anti @-@ trust issues .
( Same goes for companies like VW etc. ) .
If both news would be true , this would make the dark horizon look a little less dark indeed .
These two men would be the best choice for their respective countries in times like these in my humble opinion .
They know economics , have a reputation of being not involved in corruption , dare to do what they believe has to be done and are convinced Europeans .
The ex head of the ECB takes over at the helm of the world 's most financially trouble country and you are "@ positively @" surpised ?
Personally i was hoping for Eva Kaili , but obviously for different reasons .
He was n't the head of the ECB but one of the Vice Presidents , ie in the governing council of the ECB . For all the shortcomings of the Euro , I can n't see how the ECB has done a bad job .
He seems to be a really clever guy , understanding economics like few prime ministers in the world probably , as he teaches it in Harvard I think .
Eva Kaili would have been a great choice .
Well at least it would have made the newspapers look more interesting @...
Well , she 's not the most attractive woman in the world but for a politician there are n't many hotter out there @...
she must get lost in my posts , what with the other women and all .
I think i have a thing for blonde women @...
anyhow , so seeing as i can find myself talking positively about a socialist like this , is n't it your turn to talk about Palin like this in threads about the Tea Party ?
Btw , i think given her experience in journalism and TV media , she would have done a good job relaying the message of what the essential need of bailout measures were , to the Greek people .
She also was very respectful in her final days of dissent in the previous coallition , and did n't even call for him to resign .
That i can respect .
It 's a very good idea to have a former ECB man in the job .
We have too many bureaucrats and lawyers and career politicians in charge of economic matters .
It is good to see someone with economic experience .
I think I 'm one of those who likes watching the Superbowl for all the new ads .
Ferris Bueller was alright and Seinfeld was pretty funny , but Clint Eastwood 's ad for Chrysler makes them the winner two years in a row after Eminem 's wicked ad for them last year .
I believe Eastwood is speaking from the heart , that 's why I think it 's such an amazing and curious ad since it looks and feels so much like the kind of thing the Obama campaign would find favorable to them .
Clint Eastwood is a lifelong moderate conservative .
Fiscal conservative , social libertarian .
Voted for Nixon twice because the man promised to end the war .
His first vote was for Eisenhower .
He endorsed John McCain last time out .
Has n't endorsed anyone in that field yet , but says he likes Ron Paul .
He says he would n't call himself a hardcore conservative or an extreme lefty .
From the stuff he is for and against in recent years , it paints a picture of the kind of voter that will decide the election , and I think Eastwood taps into that feeling of wanting to make a comeback happen .
There 's something to be gained by this guy 's performance , a man of rugged self @-@ reliance who also took the time to acknowledge in the ad that "@ we all pulled together @" , his tip of that of course to the bailouts which he is supportive of .
The candidate who will win the election is the one who can tap into that emotion too .
Great ad .
Its half time in america and beer costs more because alcohol tax increases , your so hapy to be here at the game instead of your crowded house ( it 's been packed since your brother @-@ inlaw lost his job and home ) , your credit card bill is going to be major after the game , homeland security will be investigating you because of a glitch in the facial i.d. software at the enterance , your job is being outsourced next wek , your team is losing millions in endorsements , a major corporation paid millions to sell their foreign made wares to you for justt a few seconds , and your car is being repoed in the lot .
We need voters that are n't swayed by gimmicky corporate ads .
I loved the ad till I saw that it was for Chrysler . Considering they are owned by Fiat , "@ Imported from Detroit @" is a good slogan .
Still a good ad , no matter who made it .
Loved the Volkswagen one too .
There were high expectations , considering all the prices they won with the Darth Vader one last year , but I think they managed to pull it off .
I do n't even know what a Fiat is but after last night 's commercial I 'm buying two .
I have a hankering to send someone flowers via Teleflora too .
All and all , I thought it was a very down year for Super Bowl commercials and I did n't even notice the Chrysler one .
It was a bit too political for my tastes but I do n't really care if car companies want to spend a fortune on Obama ads .
I 'm a happy camper as along as I 'm allowed to cast my vote for who I think is the better candidate and make my annual political contribution of $ 0.00 to all campaigns .
Old Clint was inspirational .
At one time the repubs would have thought so as well .
But they have become infected , and are really sick .
Emotionally and mentally sicker than anyone has been in this nation in my lifetime .
They are not team players , they are so individualistic that it has become detrimental to the nation pulling together , working together .
They have taken individualism to a degree that it goes against the evolution of one of the most social animals in the world , the human being .
And "@ sharing @" is seen by them as socialism .
It really is sad , in its most basic sense , because it hinders fixing what their "@ every man is an Island @" philosophy that is tearing apart the fabric of society .
Forget Guantanimo , forge the Gulags , the CHOGM 2011 opening that Australia made the Queen and various sundry Heads of State sit through was just plain EVIL .
I always assume these sort of things are appalling .
If the Queen was n't turning up this would n't have much coverage here .
A bunch of foreign looking folk all in one place only gets coverage if a crime is committed ( they 'll get blamed , even if they are the victim ) .
There has been a small amount of coverage of Mr Rajapaksa 's problems , but since the government is n't going to charge him wiht anything it goes under the category of '@ Greens bluster @' .
Do n't you wish duelling was still legal .
It would solve so many problems .
Imagine Netanyahu challenging Ahmadinejad to a duel at the UN .
And Ahmadinejad will have Chavez as his second .
Oh , happy thought @..
Actyooally , if a debt of honor is to be solved , there is no problems with , behind the tank sheds at 4 or behind the bike sheds after school , fisticuffs gadzooks , or in politico , s circles , in the duty free binge drinking bar in the house of commons .
I was hoping for dueling between members of rival street gangs .
I 'll even provide nice hollow point ammo for them to use .
Or something like the Thunderdome .
Two men enter , one man leaves .
Mary Travers , part of the trio of Peter , Paul and Mary died yesterday after battling leukemia for many years .
I grew up listening to their music and got the chance to see them perform when I lived in VA .
I remember this group , and love some of their songs .
It was in the 1960 s .
Puff the Magic Dragon @...
I can never hear that song without imagining an AC-47 or AC-130 type gunship lazily swinging around in a constant circle , with sci-fi lasergun @-@ looking tracers pouring out like evil glowing rain @...
No wonder those grade school psychiatrists were baffled .
Hey folks @- I just found out that Debbie had an apparently small fire at her house this morning .
I just talked to her and she 's home and physically fine and dealing with the immediate aftermath so was too busy to talk .
I do n't know when she 'll have or use internet access in the next couple of days , but for those folks wondering who they could wish well this week , you now have a target .
That poor girl has busted her ass fixing up her house and installing a new heater and wood stove for the last six months and probably longer .
That really sucks ! :(
I hope she is ok and the house is still livable in especially since she encountering very cold weather and considering where she lives and all .
Thank Dale for letting us know and please do tell her were thinking about her . :(
Personally , I think they should peg it to inflation so that the pension has the same general purchasing power over time , but I know that economically it would be a disaster as people are living more and more into their older years , far past when people would traditionally die .
The retirement age has not increased , but the amount of time on retirement has .
Eventually , the military will do away with retirement benefits , or at least certain aspects of them .
It is not the British alone .
Ask me .
That is life .
They use you and then discard you !
Sooner one understands that , one shall remain happy .
I am happy !
Yet if the govt does away with retirement benefits the world over , there will be peace .
None will serve !
Army , you had me worried there for a minute as "@ they should peg it " means to die .
Service Pensions are "@ pegged @" to inflation but usually capped to 2 % ish per annum , not much more .
Servicemen should be receiving @..@ Service Pension and State pension and if they are lucky a Works pension .
Times are hard and the forecast for the near future does not look too rosy .
The retirement age in the UK is due to rise in the future , at the moment retirement is 65 and Government wants to raise it to 70 .
I must say I also have little sympathy in this case .
Assuming h retired out of choice and was not wounded , then it really is your own responsibility to handle your finances in my opinion .
The forces are just a job like any other after all .
This very thing was driven home during my first retirement class .
In the USMC you are required to attend the first day of a week long retirement seminar .
The other days are optional .
But your choice not your units .
Around the middle of the day , the leader of the seminar started asking us if we were coming back the next day .
About 70 % ( almost all combat arms guys ) said "@ No , We have things we need to do at our unit . @"
He said you all spent at least 20 yrs doing things for the Corps . Now take a week for yourself and be informed before you retire .
If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they kick you out the door talk to a retiree .
No one from HQMC will call you to see how things are going .
No one will call you a month later to see if you have a job yet or if there is anything they can help you with .
And you know what ?
No one ever did in an official capacity .
The only thing I ever got from them was a "@ We want you to come back on active duty as a full time reservist . @"
You will have to give up your retirement and disability payments .
Once we are done with you the retirement checks will n't start again until your 65 since you will be considered a reservist .
And you will have to start over from square 1 with the VA .
The Corps needs you , do n't let us down . @"
I had better things to do .
i think I let them down .
All aboard are reported safe .
Aircraft dropped in an apparent decompression state with passengers on oxygen from 40 K in a controlled dive .
Cause of the hole is unknown , aircraft is not old , being delivered in 1991 .
I 'm sure that it must have been alarming for all concerned .
The hole is enormous .
I flew out of Hong Kong last week .
:( That could have very well been me !
despite now performing maintenance overseas , as dustin hoffman said in rainman , the only airline not to have had a crash ( jet aircraft that is )
and i have two clients who work for qantas , one a 747 long haul pilot , the other a aircraft engineer .
Let me open with a brief reminder ( or history lesson ) of one of the reasons I first started watching this show @:
Now that was funny .
Craig Killborn was funny @...
"@ The Daily Show @" back then had '@ ass @-@ kicking @' interviews @...
Oh , yeah , and "@ Five Questions @" ( a wholy owned subsidiary of Craig Industries @...@ )
Now we have a sitting Vice @-@ President appearing on this show @...
Granted , a new host ( and granted the second clip was n't from the original "@ Daily Show @" ) but this is a news show ?
I 'd put in the Biden clip , only it was n't to be found on the intar @-@ tubes @... How droll @...
Anyhow , when did the "@ Daily Show @" become such an institution of news that sitting heads of state would appear on such a thing ?
I guess it got gravity when lots of young kids starting watching .
But you have to realize , Obama went on Leno , Bill Clinton and Madeline Albright have been on the Daily Show , and every Democratic candidate for governor went on the Colbert Report .
The daily show is fun and very successful .
Puts paid to the whole O Reilly Fox crap that no one watches liberals .
Jon Stewart has a great job @...@ he can give absolute free range to his opinions without any restrictions that the regular news show have .
It 's no more a news show than O'Riley , Beck , Olberman etc.
it 's a comedy show that has some commentary , Stewart would be the last one to say it 's news .
If anyone is using this a real source of news , they need to get out more .
But still , he makes me laugh and most of the time I think he has good points to be considered .
I know this clip is older , but I think he hits the nail on the head regarding most of the commentary shows .
it 's supposedly news satire , though amusingly it 's almost just as informative if not more than the actual news shows running these days .
Obviously Stewart has some political message of his own thrown in .
Similar shows appear in other countries as people get sick of how every news talk show end up being either a pure propaganda 's machine for one particular side or a bickering debate that does n't make sense to anyone .
Taiwan has a version , though it uses actors to cast as famous figures ( started mostly with political figures , but eventually ended up with pretty much all sorts of famous figures ) and they pretend to debate on a serious topic .
Thursday there will be a vote on Net Neutrality @...
How do you feel about the FCC getting their hands on the internet ?
Personally I have enjoyed the only place for actual Free Speech @...
do you want your internet censored ?
Over my dead body !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!! 1
Keep government away from the internet .
Just read the actual law and the analysis .
This law is n't what it seems to be .
Are they ever ?
The first rule of lawmaking is give the bill a name that is exactly the opposite of what it really does .
An emerging issue , how concerned are you over drug violence in Mexico ?
What potential do you see for drug violence to spill over more into the United States ?
Do you believe it to be enough of a threat that necessitates the US to take more action to do something about it , and if so , what action should that be ? ( e.g. border fence / wall , training for the Mexican police / military , monetary aid to the Mexican government , etc. )
This poll is intended for Americans .
The drug violence in Mexico started when the Mexican president decided to "@ get tough @" on the drug cartels .
Guess what ?
They fought back .
Just like the futile war on drugs in the US , the drug war in Mexico will have no greater success .
Fighting a war you can n't win is not noble .
It 's stupid .
Stop fighting the war on drugs and the violence will go down .
We need to get the government out of the prohibition game once and for all .
Legalize it , regulate it , and control it ( and tax it , too ! ) .
These drug killings are no different than Al Capone killing people during alcohol prohibition .
Once drug dealing ( AKA beer , wine , and liquor sales ) became legal and regulated , murders in America dropped dramatically .
Plus we stopped locking people up because they wanted to get drunk .
There 's more about this on my Cop in the Hood blog .
Recently i learned about Obama 's service plan , yeah may be late but better than never , and this is bothering me .
According to his website and other sources I understand Obama 's might mandate 100 Hours of Service per year when in College in exchange to $ 4000 of tuition credit .
To add this his Chief of Staff Rahm Emmanuel has confirmed on 10 th Nov to draft a plan in this regard .
Further the following is a quote form Emmanuel 's Book , The Plan @: Big Ideas for America ,
If they are just to be "@ asked @" , then it sounds like a great deal .
Though if it were , I see zero reason to limit it to college students age 18 - 25 . If it 's required it 's nothing more than a civil service draft , slavery .
Might as well be forcing 'em to work the cotton @...
Either way , good luck getting a bunch of drunk / stoned college kids to add that workload to their college and job workloads .
as long as their just asking
IMO its a fair price to pay .
This coming from someone that footed their own college tuition , No mommy and daddy allowences , no grants or anything else .
And it will keep them out of trouble and teach them some things as well .
IMO a good call and for some perhaps a way to look at things in a much better perspective .
Awesome , $ 40 / hr , that 's more than what I make .
Lets @' see @... 100 hours of service for $ 4000 credit .
So for a trillion $ bailout , someone owes 25 billion hours ?
thats if they do not mandate @... but if mandate @... that 's communism @... that the first step @....
I think it is an excellent idea , people should be made aware of what to do in a crisis .
Far to many people around the world today always expect someone to be there when a disaster strikes , especially natural disasters .
Here in New Zealand everyone is taught how to cope and survive for up to at least three days without assistance from outside .
I realize he is not in office yet @...
Day 1 .
Russia to move missiles to Baltic .
He 's already being tested .
I 'm sure the Russians want to gauge his reaction .
I can not help but recall the age old expression that Youth and Enthusiasim is no match against Wisdom and Treachery .
Obama got some clout as being the President Elect of the US but I shudder when he goes up against Putin .
Was there a specific strike that stood out ?
What was Saddam doing 2001 @-@ 2003 ?
Obama will have to do something over the top like the four previous Presidents before him did .
This savagery seems to be a requirement to prove one has the mettle to be "@ tough . @"
Nevermind that really being tough is working out a solution that does n't require bloodshed .
Negotiating an end to UN sanctions with the French , Germans and Russians .
As far Obama is concern , I would rather wait for his cabinet appointees @...
To make bold predictions on what Obama will do as president or what he will fail to do as president , one must wait to see who are the all the players .
Would GWB have invaded Iraq if it was not for the Gang of Three ( Wolfwitz , Rumsfeld and Cheney ) ? @..
probably not , and probably George Tennent would have still be running the war in Afghanistan as least had some influence there .

Then , you are consistent with your views , and there is merit in that .
Perhapes , others from the other side of the aisle are only seeking consistency , as well .
I gave you an explanation as to why he did what he did ( in part thanks to us ) .
As an anti @-@ war person , of course what he did was horrible .
I would put it akin to napalm or cluster bombs .
The innocents are murdered in a savage manner .
Why does the United States need 12 aircraft carriers ?
We do n't .
That 's why we only have 11 .
Smart @-@ arse .
Why does the US have 11 carriers .
Because 10 is not enough ?
How else can you muscle in on someone else 's turf ?
Park a few carriers off the coast and make sure the despot does n't stray too far from the "@ American interest @" angle .
You forgot we also have 12 amphib carriers .
Each one is as capable as any other carrier in the world . )
So it is in the papers today that the Bush family and the Obama family have met up at the White House for a get together .
How does that go I want to know ?
Does George walk around and whisper things to Barack like "@ See that security guard there ? Thats Ted .
DO NOT make him mad !! @" ,
"@ Careful this floor board squeaks @...@ can n't sneak in late down this hallway @"
or "@ Theres a secret to get this door locked , see you have to push on the door while pulling upward . @"
Do the Bushs show them around ?
Are they just given a map and let loose ?
Can they decorate HOWEVER they want ?
Lets say Barack wants teal shag carpeting in the oval office @....@ can he do that ?
Could Michelle have the hallways painted neon orange if she wanted ?
Do the kids get to pick their own rooms ?
Will they have to share a bathroom ?
Will they have to use a computer in the main living area so they are not accessing naughty things on the internet ?
Is the internet there blocked ?
Could the Obamas even access porn on the internet if they wanted ?
Can the secret service hear things from the outside of the doors they are guarding ?
What if the Obamas just have a personality conflict with a maid or something ?
Can they just fire them at will and have a new one sent over ?
Could they keep a pet giraffe on the grounds if they wanted to ?
If they wanted to get rid of the bowling alley and put in a discoteque could they do it ?
Do they have to put a "@ Do Not Disturb @" sign on their bedroom door , or can they just lock it when they want some undisturbed time ?
And does the secret service knock and wait for an answer or just go charging into the bedrooms / bathrooms .
I wonder if they have ever "@ walked in @" on a president .
There is this really nice site on the White House
Very detailed info and pictures of most of the important rooms , spanning several eras .
I think this shows that pretty much every President can do any design thing they want with both the Residence and the Office Wings
Good questions .
I too would love to know the answers .
I hope someone can help !
As per Anderson 360 , the Incoming First Family get $ 100,000 to do any changes to their living quarters of about 16 room .
Also , any change that they can do is after consultation with historians , since ostensibly any change they would do would become a part of the nation 's history
That does not seem much , especially after considering the extensive changes some previous presidents did .
Not that I am complaining ; thats my tax dollars that 's funding those lavender curtains
Looks like the National REview has already started hedging its bets for a possible defeat .
I am surprised at this .
Surely this is not the time to write down your won candidate
Also , I do n't agree with the tone of the article that McCain 's principled positions are costing his this election .
Do you think far right parties like the BNP in the UK should be accepted as representing a decent part of society or should they be viewed as hate filled bigots ?
Many working class English feel that the UK is no longer Great Britain due to too many immigrants .
Is it racist to think this if you live in an area with more ethnics then Brits like inner city London ?
What do others think ?
Do far right parties deserve more respect or will they always be seen as bigots .
Yes it is .
In order to afford to stay in inner city LONDON , a person , probably along with his family , has to have a monthly income that supports this .
In order to do that a ethnic , has to have a stable job and thus already proving himself worthy . / rant over .
Generally speaking the working @-@ class in a nation have negative views of immigrants because they 're at the economic margins and view immigrants as competition for scarce opportunities .
I do n't see anything wrong with the long-term concerns on immigration that many in the UK may hold , but reform can be carried out through the mainstream parties in Britain without having to resort to a racist / fascist party .
If you 're concerned about immigration from the EU , then withdraw from the EU .
It 's a racist / fascist party .
It may have moderated its tune , but that 's what it is at its core .
Failed coup has led to this trial with Sir Mark Thatcher , Spanish and South African government 's fingered .

thank god for the French
we have all seen the stereotypes the Frenchman defeated by germans in war ungrateful to the heroic american who had their back in WW2 or the snobby french people whole ignore tourists who speak english
BUT france is the western contradiction of the easts prejudiced views
france maybe a white European ex @-@ colonial western democracy but by no means are they right behind america or britain
when it comes to doing of thinking time and time again france has should the world
not all western nations is the follower of america as its is widely perceived
and i do n't think the french will be demanding that the chinese govt suppress the demonstrations we have heard of in china
after all the chinese people are doing what tibetan monks and exiles were fighting for to do in tibet - freedom to protest
( though i must say the attacks on han chinese people has taken a bit of credibility from the tibetan monks )
You know there is one job I DO N'T want this summer and that is the HCIC Security of the Olympics .
Rumour is now that Western visitors are planning to protest during the Olympics and considering the reaction today , we can expect a hell of a lot of kung fu .
That would be extremely distracting when you 're on the look out for car bombs and AK-47s .
Did the Chinese police state let western media see what was actually happening unlike in Tibet ?
When rallies happen in communist states they are rarely not state supported activities
yay for the French @...@ at least one western democracy opposes communist police states still .
The Chinese were mostly only buying unlicensed copyright infringed copies of name brand french goods anyway .
If they stopped buying American DVDs it would only mean LICENSED ones .
GO on EbaY they even sell the knock offs to us .
The uhygurs are mostly moslem and an ethnic minority in western china with no self determination ruled by a communist police state .
because some have joined extremist groups does not de @-@ legitmize the plight of an entire people .
i do n't under stand the problem people have with what was said by jack Cafferty .
in the US we have thought communist regimes were thugs and goons since Stalin in the 50 s right ?
I think those ok with the chinese police state are really ok with the $ to be made there and they were never concerned about freedom only the spread of market capitalism .
The Chinese were brilliant in adopting large scale no regulation market capitalism thereby co @-@ opting so many Americans who place capitalism and profit motive above a belief in democracy and freedom .
We really need to get out of bed with tyranny if we support freedom in the US
Or rather they do n't know how to use it .
The individual Tibetan has far more clout than the average Han .
The number of posters here touting how good the Tibetans have it is testament to that .
The problem is that the majority of Tibetans are nowhere near the centres where that clout could benefit them .
They are in their little village .
Yes , you may get 1 st seat at Beijing University with far lower grades @...
but you still have to study and go to Beijing 1 st .
If you 're stuck in your village , you 're SOL .
The other major problem is that because that very few Chinese citizens who are knowledgeable enough to challenge the municipal governments are nowhere near the Tibetans .
Even if the Tibetans want to sue , they do n't know how and that opens up to corruption and abuse since they know the Tibetans will n't take them to court over it .
I will be attending a meeting with the Veterans Day Parade committee .
We have a Parade on or about Veterans Day in November down Atlantic Avenue in North Long Beach .
We have been doing this for several years now and have had many varied entrants including Mexican prancer horses , re @-@ enactors in various uniforms ( including WW I and WW II German ) , Cavalry units of various countries ( the WW II German cavalry @"@ man @" was actually a pretty girl using the helmet to hide her hair ) .
We had a problem last year in that a Gay Pride group wanted to be part of our parade but we kept them out with the excuse that they only suddenly showed up and did not apply to be a unit .
This year we are being "@ asked @" to include an Anti @-@ War unit in the parade made up mostly of people protesting the war in Iraq .
Any ideas on this ?
Besides the initial mistrust of "@ not believeing @" they will not disrupt the parade , unless they are willing to sign a document stating they will honour the ones who gave the ultimate sacrifice , and give thanks to the ones who are currently fighting to ensure they "@ can have an opinion @" and not in anyway disrupt the parade @....@ then I would say no they can not join the parade @.......
If they will sign said socument then welcome to the parade .
I would guess both groups want to politicise the event , which is after all to honour veterans , not make a political statement .
If they want a political rally , they can organise their own ,
if they want to participate as veterans then nobody 's stopping them from parading with their units .
If they are n't vets , it 's not their right to parade .
With the troubles in the world economy , and the pound rapidly losing value against the euro , is it time for the UK to adopt the euro ?
What are the advantages of Britain adopting the euro , and what are the disadvantages ?
Have the advantages or disadvantages changed with the current financial crisis ?
It 'll cost a lot to do it which would not be advisable at the current time with the economic situation not looking rosy ,
besides the people here would not stand for such a move .
So even if it made sense it would be political suicide to try and do it .
I just can n't imagine sitting in a restraunt and ordering a human steak !
I 'm not even sure this url thing is gonna work but it 's a story about scientists growing meat in a vat ( stem cell research ) .
From Yahoo science news friday 11 / 20 / 09 .
What do you think about this article / if the url works @... Let me know .
Vat grown meat instead of factory farmed chicken / pork / beef ?
No more E. coli , mad cow , anthrax or foot and mouth to worry about .
Seems like a good idea to me .
Whats not to like ?
Friend of mine in Peru has a whole cookbook full of recipes for long pig .
Hell , I 'd try anything once , but if I change my mind , bet Andrew Zimmer would be right there with a fork and a knife !
On this the 70 th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor , we remember all those that are still entombed there and their shipmates !
We are here because they are there !
It seems as each year goes by , more and more lessons of history are forgotten !
Our fearless leader 's children 's private school is observing the day by serving Japanese food for lunch !
The Japanese are observing this day as well by telling everyone that it never happened or we made them attack us because we would n't give them things .
If you ever get the chance to to watch the documentary about Nanking and the other Japanese atrocities during WWII you will be shocked to find a picture taken of a Japanese private bayoneting a civilian and the interview with that very private saying he did n't do it as do many of the Japanese soldiers who did things like this .
Sorry , no love lost for the Japanese .
The Carrier JFK CV67 was due to arrive yesterday however she was held off an additional day due to high winds in the area and will arrive today at the Inactive Ships Reserve at the former PNSY where she will reside for the next two years in mothballs .
41 Years of service to the USN .
Now it is only a matter of time before Kitty retires and brings to an end the era of steam powered CV 's in the USN .
They need to sell her for scrap and get rid of that floating wreck .
Why waste money maintaining a ship that was in such bad shape , she could n't conduct air ops before they decommissioned her ?
curious in part about how so many of the carriers got to be in . "@ poor material condition @"
I 'm just confused about the posibility of this happening can someone explain it to me ?
Secondly wow has scrapping and breaking gotten to be so expensive that its considered better / more cost effective to do a sink @-@ ex weird .
Thats a massive amount of proccessed metal .
As more and more ships are built , the scrappers have more and more ships to scrap .
Simply put , the scrappers are falling behind .
Shipyards appear as manufacturing plants ,
scrappers appears as junk yards .
Plus there is glory in building wonderful ships , there is no glory tearing the ships apart .
Special occasions such as keel laying , ship christening , and commissioning ceremonies deal with shipbuilding , no ceremonies for scrapping .
When you go to a store to buy a new shiny mop bucket , you feel happy to do so .
You feel lucky when you receive a new shiny roll of pennies from the bank , you frown when its the old rusty roll of pennies .
When you discard the rusty old mop bucket , you do n't feel sorry to do so . Its people oriented too .
Since carriers costs so much , they are kept in service longer .
Many are of the age of old monochrome television sets , or in the early days of color television sets , you know the ones without remote control .
You would n't think of buying a television without remote control today .
They are so old , they do n't make them any more .
With the carriers , they received their mid @-@ life refits upgrading their electronics and electrical motors .
They have also received their service life extension programs too , upgrading or replacing their larger machinery components .
How many of us still have a 1960 s vintage refrigerator , washer and dryers , dishwashers , televisions , automobiles , hot water tanks , ranges and ovens , etc.
US offers warships to India for first time
Interesting in that the USN is planning to prematurely decommission its MHC 51 Osprey class mine @-@ hunting ships .
As regards amphibious ships the USN wants desperately to decommission its steam @-@ powered LHA 1 Tarawa class ( LHA 3 Belleau Wood will actually be decommissioned this fall ) .
These ships will soon start turning thirty years old with no SLEP being undertaken .
It is also said they have aged much quicker than anticipated .
The USN poured a ton of money into the LPD 4 Austin class ships to keep them going for 40 years ( in some cases it will be 40 plus ) w/o a SLEP .
They do n't want to repeat the experience .
Eventually thsi may leave only eight LHD 1 Wasp class ships until and IF LHA ( R ) class ships get built .
Also the LPD 17 San Antonio class will be trucated at eight ships IMHO ( some say seven others nine and nine have already been named ) .
This would also open up the possibility of prematurely decommissioning ships as many as four LSD 41 Whidbey Island class ships now turning 20 years old .
Selling two LHA 1 class ( Plus granting two others as spares hulks ) and four LSD 41 class ships to India is intriguing IMHO .
This would give India a ready @-@ made credible amphibious force for very little cost .
With the demise of the Battleships almost a certainty and only a handful , if any , of the DDX class ships to be built ( Plus the truncated LPD program ) the USN is poised to cut its amphibious forces by 1 / 3 .
The USN is also attempting to fast @-@ track its Seabasing platforms which theoretically would make @-@ up for the draw @-@ down in legacy amphibious warfare platforms .
More on that sometime in the future .
Just my analysis of the situation based on what is available from open sources .
it is a good start because it adds a whole dimension to the INdian armed forces @....
can land forces through these transports anywhere in the indian ocean @...
yeah , but i do n't think it make that much of a difference @...@ since we already have plenty of large landing ships @...@ which we can manufacture indiginously if necessary .
The landing ship is something we can do without .
It is a very old decrepit ship that needs a huge major overhaul to bring it up to today 's standards .
IN would be better off buying a new ship with that kind of money .
INDIA IS BUYING ship TRENTON ( LPD-14 ) .
NOT BECAUSE OF ITS WAR MAKING CAPABILITY .
BUT TO MOVE HUMANETARIAN AIDS IN ASIAN REGION LIKE IN CASE OF TSUNAMI .
INDIAN NAVY DO NOT HAVE BIG TRANSPORT SHIP LIKE TRENTON WHICH CAN LAND MATERIAL ON SEA BEACHES ETC.
IT ONLY HAS MAGARS CLASS LANDING SHIPS . SO IF INDIAN NAVY GET THIS SHIP , THEN I THINK IT IS OK .
AT LEAST IT WILL GET A CHEAP SHIP FOR DOING MOSTLY HUMANETERIAN WORK .
WAR MAKING WILL BE SECONDARY WORK FOR THIS SHIP .
AND THIS IS THE ONLY REASON THAT AMERICANS HAVE SUDDENLY AGREED TO SUPPLY INDIA THIS PARTICULAR SHIP .
REGARDING AGIS RADARS .
IT IS A SEPARATE ITEM .
WHY ARE YOU DISCUSSING IT ON THIS THREAD .
FIRST LET US BUY THIS SHIP , THEN WE CAN DISCUSS OTHERS .
This is what happens when you take shipboard safety for granted .
Tanks are always dangerous .
Ive been in many and hated every second of it .
I got derided and laughed at alot for the seemingly overcaustiousness I ALWAYS undertook .
People die if you do n't .
I preferred not to die thisway . @:
Tanks are very dangerous places .
We were always taught in First Aid / Rescue never to enter a tank if there was someone unconsious inside @...
cause you would be next .
Unnecessary tragedy .
I read a story relating to the cleaner Trychlrothylene used to clean a tank in the RN back inthe 70 s , the guy was around it too long that his mylenin ( the fatty cover around the spine ) was eaten away by it and he went bonkers for a few hours and then died .
Hell you have to take alot of caution when you are working in closed areas with noxious fumes , even building models you can get messed up off the paints if you do n't have an open window .
Yanks out , bombers in , 12 bombs , dozens killed , control battle starts , sunnis v shites , millions of dollars / pounds spent , lives lost , FOR WHAT , for sweet fuck all that 's what ,
Iraqi forces have no chance of controlling ,
Iraq is gonna get worse now than before the west tried to make it better
The innocents are gonna suffer just like before .
lets get out of AG as well leave the village tribal idiots to it .
If push comes to shove , slash n burn , waste no more lives n cash on useless campaign 's . IMO
Does this surprise anyone ? Excluding our glorious leaders of course
IMO , The Iraqi 's screwed themselves by giving into the Sadrists and others .
As mentioned before the US should have punched his ticket and his army of idots before departing Iraq .
Once again politics interviened and spared their sorry ass .
This is what they get in return for that stupid decision .
The large "@ gray area @" knows no boundries . And once you let religion into politics instead of keeping them separate the black and white disappears depending upon who you are and only gray exists .
A very dismal commentary .
There is no doubt that repeated deployment in the combat zone does wear out individuals . It does lead to whole lot of man management and domestic problems .
And it does create innumerable problems for the govt which has to maintain its aim and deliver .
A catch 22 situation .
That the troops are still managing speaks very highly of their dedication and patriotism and they should be commended .
To overcome this problem , one way could be draft .
But that would be a political suicide .
Also , a draft will not guarantee that the soldiers would be better .
In fact , many misfits would be in , leading to greater problems as was seen in Vietnam .
One of the solution is to have a volunteer force of all nationalities like the French Foreign Legion ( being discussed elsewhere in the Forum ) .
All said and done , a difficult situation indeed , but the national aim can not be forsaken !
It 's just one person 's point @-@ of @-@ view , but from what I can tell , there 's LOTS of fight left in these guys .
I 'm around CENTCOM 's warriors all day every day , and I can tell you that they do n't seem tired and worn out to ME .
One stat I keep seeing thrown around is the approval / disapproval rating of how the war is being conducted .
But if only one third of the troops like the way we 're going about the business of winning in Iraq , that does NOT necessarily mean they 've lost faith in the mission .
Hell , as for myself , I 'm not crazy about how we 're proceeding , either .
But that does n't mean I do n't believe in the mission .
Far from it - I want to go at the job HARDER . I want to WIN .
I want the surge to be BIGGER , SOONER , and to last as long as it takes to WIN .
So , although it 's only my perspective here and backed by absolutely no numbers , stats or facts other than what I know from personal observation , I simply do not see the impending crash coming .
What I can tell you that I do see is a frustrated will to victory , and a sense that our leaders and People are not as committed as we are .
Bluesman , This repeated turnover and its effect I understand to some degree since we ( Indian Army Infantry units ) are always back in the CI grid after every two years .
If we were sent without this break , I am sure we would have got really fed up .
As it is , we have started having problems inspite of this two year layover in peace stations , since the standard of living has gone up and our troops are getting urbanised and soft .
We also have the advantage that we are from the same unit for life in most cases and so the cohesiveness is more and we know each other well .
I believe in the US Army , soldiers can be posted to any unit .
What is the time gap between turn over for Iraq ?
You 'd have to work around them to truly understand what I mean .
Otherwise , I just do n't think you 'd really be able to see it the way I do .
In my job , I work with ALL the inter @-@ agency players , and I NEVER experience the kind of inertia and drag with anybody else .
This is absolutely the truth @: the State Department wonks down here do not want to be associated with the word '@ kill @' , as in my branch 's mission of '@ capture or kill enemy high @-@ value individuals @' .
That 's what we attempt to do ; that 's what they want no part of .
And you 'd have to be here to know what it is to be frustrated and impeded by people that vehemently object to your very existence .
I wish I could express it in a way that you would know what I mean .
( You probably think I 'm just impatient with bureaucracy , which I am , or that it 's a squabble about methods , and there 's certainly those , too .
But it 's MORE than that . )
Then , I think , you would not think it too strident to say they have an antipathy toward an American victory .
bluesman , i have n't worked inter @-@ agency , so i trust you know best .
however , in their defense , i would like to mention that
1 . the pinstripers have n't been exactly beloved or respected by the bush administration .
some of this is fair ( state was all but ignored in 2003 ) , some of this is not ( bureaucratic irritation at the initiatives kicking them out of comfortable perches and into WoT hotspots ) .
2 . CIA has got plenty of ex @-@ military , and there 's enormous pressure to get more .
i trust that i break no state secrets by telling you that if you head over to langley , you will see a lot of twenty @-@ somethings and lots of fifty @-@ year old senior staff , and not much in between . the lack of a middle is really making 'em push for ex @-@ military to fill that .
i can assure you that patriotism is high up on their values , more so than ever .
I 'll try to explain my perspective on all this .
It might ramble at times .
I was for the war , still am if it could be fought properly , but it can n't be .
Bush 's goal is a secure Iraq , with a functioning gov't that can police the country and be an American ally in the War On Terror .
THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN .
My knowledge is all second hand , but that 's all I have to go on .
I 'm seeing a picture of a nation of subhuman savages .
Did anyone ever bother to ask WHY Saddam did the things he was hung for ?
We 're seeing the answer to that question .
These people need a dictator who 's willing to use mass murder when they step out of line .
Unfortunately we are n't prepared to use similar tactics , so this war is unwinnable .
If it was up to me , everytime an IED goes off we 'd get our people out , draw a circle on a map with at least a 500 m radius around the point of the blast , and turn that area into a smoking crater .
And I do n't care if there 's a school full of kids there with classes in session .
Do that a few times and these "@ people @" might start to behave better .
We can surge troops all we want , but if the level of cruelty does n't increase it will all be pointless .
That 's the only thing they understand .
I can n't believe I was stupid enough to buy all the tripe about what Iraq could become if we just remove the dictator .
I also have some problems with Bush that I did n't have when I voted for him , based on his piss poor performance .
He 's recently changed policy to go after the Iranian agents that are supplying the militias .
We 've seen stories that the CIA has been tracking these Iranians for over two years .
Why change now ?
WHY DID N'T WE WHACK THEM AS SOON AS THEY WERE IDENTIFIED ???
How many Americans are dead or maimed because Bush was playing some diplomatic footsy game with Iran ?
There are two of our Border Agents in prison for doing their jobs , and twelve Marines sitting in jail in San Diego for hitting the wrong house after they were attacked in Haditha .
Bush has n't lifted a finger to help either of those groups of men , and that 's why IMO Bush has shown himself to be nothing but an honorless pig .
Can someone talk me out of this ?
Because it 's looking pretty damn bleak to me .
IEDs @: The Lazy Man 's Insurgency
It 's time to take another look at Iraq , because there 's been a big change in insurgent tactics in 2005 . That 's inevitable . War makes people on both sides think faster . Peacetime armies never learn anything ; wartime armies learn new tricks faster than a hungry raccoon .
The big change is that the insurgents have decided to rely on IEDs rather than ambushes with shoulder @-@ fired weapons to kill the two or three GIs per day they figure they need to wear down the US public 's will to stay in the fight . And it 's working , way too well .
The stats are clear @: IED victims make up a bigger chunk of our casualties every month . Over the last six months , IEDs have caused 63 % of US combat deaths . Last month ( October 2005 ) was typical @: out of 96 US troops killed , IEDs were responsible for 57 .
Compare that with April 2004 , a terrible month when we lost 140 troops . Back then the insurgents relied on RPGs and small arms . Only 19 of our 140 KIA that month @-@ barely more than a tenth @-@ were killed by IEDs .
The insurgents have decided to do it the easy way . As long as they can use IEDs , their low @-@ tech standoff weapon , why should they risk close combat ?
The real question is why they can get away with it . And here @-@ well , I hate to keep saying this , but somebody needs to . The reason they can do it is because we still have NO INTEL on them . It 's the biggest failure of the war , and nobody talks about it . CI warfare is about people , not hardware . We 're all hardware and no intelligence , like a Tim Allen show . Makes me sick .
That makes the decision to go with IEDs a no-brainer for the insurgents . In the standard ambush , the kind we were facing a year ago , the insurgents detonated an IED under a convoy , then opened up on the stalled survivors with RPG and small arms fire . It probably made them feel good , sort of their version of shock and awe , but the rifle fire was ineffective and by concentrating their forces , the insurgents made themselves vulnerable to our air power .
The problem in any guerrilla battle is the getaway . Anybody can pull a trigger ; the trick is getting your men home safe , while enemy choppers zoom through the sky and every street is full of troops and armor looking for men of military age . That 's the tough part .
An IED ambush has none of those risks . Only one man needs to be on the spot @-@ the triggerman . He detonates the IED from a car parked down a side street and drives away before the occupiers can even start their search . No risk . No casualties . Very demoralizing for the occupiers , especially since they know damn well that everybody in the neighborhood was in on the attack but they can n't level the locals @' shacks like they 're dying to .
What makes this wave of IEDs worse is that the devices are getting more effective . Frankly I 've been shocked at how good the Iraqis are with these things right from the start . I mean , after that shameful performance in GW I , did you expect these bastards to be so sneaky , patient , and smart ? I knew this war was a bad idea , but even I never realized what we 'd be up against .
The scariest tech development of all is that the insurgents have learned how to make shaped @-@ charged IEDs . To understand why shaped charges are such a powerful weapon , we have to go into the incredibly cool world of explosive physics . I love this stuff . I mean , what red @-@ blooded American boy did n't experiment with explosives ? The only reason I ever opened my Chem book was to see if it mentioned TNT or dynamite in the index . ( It did n't @-@ goddamn hippie teachers . ) And naturally I used the local wildlife , like toads and bees , in my experiments with the killing power of firecrackers .
What I learned was the most important point about the subject @: blast alone does n't do a good job of killing the target . A bee would wobble off unhurt after one of my 4 th of July daisycutters went off right next to it .
Now before you hotheads whose hobby is making pipe bombs in the garage write me angry letters ( or send me long round packages with no return address ) , I know a blast can kill , if it 's a big enough blast . We had a really nasty example of that in August this year , when a huge IED killed 14 Marines near Haditha . From what I 've read , investigation showed there was nothing special about the IED . It was just three anti @-@ tank mines stacked in a pile @-@ the IHOP of IEDs , I guess you could call it .
That ambush showed real clearly how important intelligence is in guerrilla warfare . The same unit that suffered the IED attack had just had six of its snipers killed in a small @-@ arms ambush . Now you tell me how anybody can ambush six snipers unless they 've completely penetrated the unit . The insurgents knew where the unit 's snipers would assemble , and they knew where the vehicle would be passing . We do n't know a thing about the enemy , but it 's clear that he knows way too much about us .
The other problem is that the 14 Marines were riding in one of those ridiculous landing crafts the Corps uses as APCs @-@ in Haditha , hundreds of clicks from the sea ! It 's called the AAV-7A1 , and it looks like a giant armored dinghy . Since it was designed to ferry troops ashore , it sacrifices armor and speed and damn near everything else to an amphibious capability that has no use anymore . But that 's the Corps for you . Real brave , but not always real smart .
Maybe if those guys had been in a real APC some would have survived . I can n't say . If the blast is big enough , it can kill even an MBT . The Pals took out two Israeli Merkavas , the best @-@ armored tanks in the world , with simple blast IEDs .
But most of the time , guerrillas do n't have the delivery systems to depend on blast power . If they 're trying to kill soft targets @-@ i.e. people @-@ they pack the bomb with homemade shrapnel @: roofing nails , ball bearings , anything that 'll shred flesh . A suicide vest tipped with nails is basically a 360 @-@ degree 12 gauge .
To kill GIs that way , you need to catch them off @-@ guard , somewhere they feel safe . That 's what happened when a Jihadi killed more than a dozen of our guys in a mess hall in Mosul while they were having lunch -- minus their body armor .
In the field , US troops are a hard kill , especially because they move in armored convoys protected by choppers . And that 's the real beauty of IED attacks for a guerrilla @: they absolutely nullify US air power . There are literally no targets for the attack choppers . The pilots know damn well that one of those Iraqi cars driving away from the scene is carrying the guy who set off the IED , but there 's no way to tell which one .
In a strange way , we 're looking at a 3D war . We control the air , but the Iraqis literally control the underground , thanks to these buried IEDs . We fly , they dig .
The insurgents @' first IEDs were simple . Not that there 's anything wrong with simple . The weapons that have been hurting us are all simple , like the RPG . Simplicity is the guerrilla 's friend .
Those early IEDs were usually just shells buried by the road , wired up to a detonator . Lots of amateurs were tinkering in their garages , or whatever Iraqis have instead of garages , playing with stuff that goes boom . And naturally lots of those guys went boom themselves .
Like I said , war teaches people fast , but some of the lessons have to be learned by the next of kin , not the handyman whose bright idea for a new type of bomb turned him into an abstract painting all over his wall .
Sometimes an insurgency has to learn its lessons several times . Take the case of pressure @-@ triggered IEDs . These are basically standard anti @-@ vehicle mines , with something like a bathroom scale as trigger . People and cars can pass over them unharmed , but if a really heavy ( meaning armored ) vehicle rolls over that scale , the bomb goes off . ( Trucks are a problem . Some trucks weigh as much as an APC . ) The best part is that you do n't even need a triggerman to set it off . You can all be off at the hookah parlor polishing up your alibis when it goes off .
The insurgents in Baqouba used pressure bombs in 2003 , but they usually failed to go off . Their bombmakers did n't have the technique yet .
Thanks to info @-@ sharing , the internet gives an insurgency , they 're back at it , with better wiring diagrams . A week ago ( Oct. 24 '@ 05 ) , a pressure bomb shredded a Humvee in Baqouba , tearing four GIs legs to pieces .
The first IEDs were mostly mortar rounds that failed against our armor . So the insurgents went to big 155 mm rounds . That 's a big , big shell and when you trigger it at the right moment , it 's going to kill almost anything but an M1 .
The M1 is a great tank , so it 's kind of scary to read the stats on how many of them the insurgents have managed to knock out . As usual , the invasion was the easy part and the occupation was when things got lethal . We only lost 18 M1s in the conventional fighting , but the guerrillas have since managed to disable 80 . Now most of those are track damage , but that 's enough to put a tank out of action .
The good news is that the M1 has lived up to its rep for crew protection . The Army 's Armor Center says only five crew have died in IED attacks on M1s . ( Ten other M1 crew have been killed , mostly by sniper fire , riding in open hatches . )
So if you 're an insurgent bomb @-@ maker , your goal is to find a way to kill M1s . Not just knock a tread off , but destroy it and kill the crew . And that 's where the shaped @-@ charge IED comes in . Shaped charges were developed for tank killing , used in MBT anti @-@ armor rounds and antitank weapons . Their warheads are basically thick cups of soft metal . Metals with low melting points , usually copper . The bomb @-@ maker 's job is to make sure as much of the force of the blast is channeled to the copper cone as possible . So sometimes he 'll put several 155 mm shells beneath the copper , or pack a whole lot of TNT under it .
When the IED detonates , this copper cup turns into a shaft of superheated metal that can zip right through any armor , even an M1 's . That 's what they tell me , and I have to believe it .
It 's the kind of weird science that used to frustrate me in Physics , the sort of info you just have to take on faith . I can n't help wondering if they 're kidding us civvies about it all . I do n't get why a soft metal like copper can penetrate Chobham armor , which can defeat almost any warhead around .
Apparently the copper is n't even actually molten . It ejects as a solid ; it just "@ behaves like molten metal . @" I 'm sure the insurgent Home Improvement tinkerers do n't understand the science involved any more than I do . They just hear that it works and try it out .
The US countermeasures have been pretty lame so far . Convoys travel with jammers that make it harder to detonate the IED by cell phone or garage door opener @-@ Nokia and Genie sales are going to drop in the Sunni Triangle . But like I said , low @-@ tech is the guerrilla 's friend . These days they 've gone back to wires , and I hear some are even using string . You can n't jam a string .
Beyond that , Bush policy is to blame Iran , or Syria , or Satan or whoever .
Iran ? Maybe . Syria ? No way . Syria 's scared to death , ready to do anything to make Uncle Sam happy . And if it is Iran , what can we do about it ? There are still a few neocons so totally out of their little gourds they want us to invade Iran . I have to wonder if they 're agents of Dr Evil , programmed to destroy America . Because invading Iran would do it , it 'd end us once and for all .
This blame stuff is a sign of frustration . Nobody knows how to stop IEDs , even with all the Popular Mechanics geeks sending in their garage @-@ tech brainstorms . That 's because @-@ damn , how many times do I have to repeat it ? @-@ guerrilla war has no technical solution . Or even military solution . The only effective CI techniques are torture , reprisal and , ultimately , genocide .
My guess is that genocide will come back one day . That was how the Ancients dealt with rebellious towns @: wiped 'em out . One of these days some first @-@ world country is going to get impatient and a problem child like the Sunni Triangle will be a big , radioactive ghost town .
If we do n't do it , the Kurds may end up doing it the old @-@ fashioned way they learned from the Turks @: one bullet , one village at a time . It 's been done before -- seen any Armenians up there lately ? Probably not , but most of "@ Kurdistan @" used to be "@ Armenia . @" A few of the Armenians made it to Fresno , but the rest are buried up there .
We 're talking about Mesopotamia here , the place where war was invented . Hundreds of peoples have been wiped out forever in those parts . All these Holocaust lobbyists get furious if anybody says Jews are n't the only tribe to get genocided , but that 's just politics @-@ "@ Our genocide is better than your genocide ! @"
The fact is , genocide is , historically , the most common result when one tribe runs into another . And something tells me the next big wipeout will happen right there in Central Iraq .
It has a large sky is falling slat but decent read on the IEDs @...
It is true that the IEDs are effective .
It is not a "@ Lazy Man 's Insurgency @" but a "@ Cunning and Diabolical Man 's Insurgency @"
Raj ,
Sorry , as I stated , I did n't have much time , but the wife now has the newborn .
A few superficial criticisms @:
1 . It 's not CI ( counter @-@ intelligence ) . CI is when you thwart your enemy 's intel operations . Thus , gaining intel on when / where the insurgents are planting IEDs is intel , not counter @-@ intel .
2 . Iraqis do n't have garages at their houses . Thus , I would conclude that this guy has never stepped foot in Iraq .
Some meaty criticisms @:
1 . The Marine 's AAV is as armored as the standard Army APC - the M113 . It sounds as if this pundit is probably a former Army guy . Based on the damage to the single AAV that was involved , unless it were a M-1 , more armor would n't have helped . That 's how big the IEDs are getting .
2 . A single 155 mm round does n't do any significant damage to US armored vehicles ( the up @-@ armored HMMWV is n't a true armored vehicle in the sense that it was designed from the ground up with armor in mind - it was modified from a cargo vehicle ) . For example , on the Stryker , a 155 mm round will scratch some paint off and flatten tires .
3 . War is like a sport . It is interactive and tactics , techniques , and procedures evolve continuously in reaction to your opponent . Back to the sports analogy , if you 're getting killed in a zone defense , you switch to man @-@ to @-@ man , etc. He seems to apply a template that the enemies of the US should be dumb and not react . Underestimating your enemy is a bad and dumb thing to do .
4 . He fails to mention the intel that we get that allows us to defuse the majority of IEDs before they are detonated .
5 . He fails to mention how switching back to wired devices makes it easier to catch the trigger man .
6 . He fails to mention how using larger devices means that you need to spend more time preparing the site , which means a greater chance of compromise .
7 . He complains about intel , but then advocates harsh techniques that run contrary to the values of the US and does n't weigh the impact that these techniques would have on gaining intel from the population and / or bringing the population off the fence and to our side . His recommendations would result is less intelligence - gaining some information from a paid triggerman may result in a few short-term successes within a particular cell , but it will alienate the population and result is less intel over the long @-@ run from the population and future cells that would be created down the road due the increased perception of occupation through the harsh techniques he advocates . As an example , Abu Ghraib , which was the direct result of a half @-@ dozen irresponsible individuals that were able to conduct their abuses due to the lacking leadership of their supervisors , had a huge negative impact on our relations with local Iraqis . The trust we had built with many was eroded and our ability to gain trust with others was much more challenging .
Bottomline , he does n't truly analyze the situation from all aspects and uses some faulty assumptions and some facts that are flat out wrong . In the end , you have the action @-@ reaction @-@ counteraction cycle that is producing bigger IEDs that are easier to catch , but more deadly if you do n't catch it . I 'm not stating that it 's not a problem , but this analysis does n't offer much value .
I hope this helps . As far approaches to COIN , I 'm sure that Ray , Lemontree , Dave Angel , and some of the others on this board whose militaries have been doing COIN for much longer than the US ( which , BTW has done COIN quite frequently , but then shuns it as a freak occurrence and does n't internalize the lessons learned in favor on focusing on the "@ big threat @" ) can comment at length on why this article espouses the wrong approach to the problem .
I 'm just wondering what Indian posters think your government 's reaction would be if Australia asked for finished nuclear weapons and missiles , plus nuclear know how , with you for under the table shipments of yellowcake for your nuclear weapons program ?
You see , I 'm hoping that one day befor it is too late that Australia will wake up to the fact that we can n't rely on the US to be willing to lose a city over us by holding true on the '@ nuclear umbrella @' , if ever we had a conflict with China .
By shipping you yellowcake from say a secret source on defence land acqured for '@ training @' , we could keep it outside the NPT inspection treaty process so you can build bombs with it .
We ould even fly in vetted Indian miners ( with training ) to avoid the secret getting out here . It would benefit us by allowing payments to be made outside our budget approprations process , which is transparent .
Once we have our missiles we can announce that we are joining you in the non @-@ aligned movement , transport weapons grade uranium between us openly and generally ignore all the complaints it would generate and other peoples wars , just like you do now .
Does this work for you ?
It would n't be that hard for Australia to build nukes by yourselves .
Involving outsiders usually increases the amount of headaches you have to deal with .
IMO , Every "@ first world @" - technologically modern nation could probably do it today - some have chosen not to ( like Japan and Germany ) perhaps because of history ?
I think Australia probably could do it if they wanted too , and the rest of the world would n't object as much as they would if one of the historically aggressive non @-@ nuclear nations did it .
A lot of the nuclear weapons tech that was unattainabe 20 @-@ 30 years ago is attaintable now . It would be very expensive , and there would be consequences .
Why should we sell ?
The only reasons we would were if we really needed the money or if the yellowcake were not available elsewhere or if you were the only ones who had something we really needed from an existential perspective as barter .
It could and would probably work if India were to place their own nukes under Indian control onto Australian soil .
For your defense and our own .
Expanding deterrent .
But then you have that option already with the US , so the fact that you ask this question probably points to a drift in confidence or the fact that you feel you would be able to better control an Indian nuke umbrella to your prime advantage versus a US one .
Tired of the ever @-@ hulking , always @-@ advancing glacier of DVD and BD cases in my living room , I 've procured a media server and a Boxee box to run it .
My plan is to migrate all of my media ( probably about 700 DVDs and BDs , counting all the TV shows I have ) onto the server over the next year or so , and banish the hardcopy to a closet for backup .
Media server with 6 TB storage running FreeNAS lives in the basement , Boxee box hooked into AV stack ( Plasma , BD player , CD player , cable box , Receiver ) lives upstairs , CAT-5 network .
So far I 'm getting great quality playback from some items , but real movies that I 've ripped are not great .

If there 's a visible difference between the DVD and the copy then it 's being compressed .
Sometimes the format you decide to convert it to has issues .
I seldom do it so I 'm not really au fait with what is good but the software I use is Handbrake and convert it to either.mov files or uncompressed mpeg4

how 'd they possibly pull @-@ off semi scifi without looking like a bad copy of Halo @..
They should do some type of geurilla warfare game set in a wartorn African or South American country .
That could be interesting , like a FPS Contra .

Looks like they packed a lot more missions into COD 6 compared to COD 4 .
I am so looking forward to October !
This is so much better than last year when I saw the COD 5 trailer ( Flamethrowers and all ) and all I could think of was - "@ Oh Dear @...@ @"
Since many of our troops are stuck in Iraq , it is likely that we may not have the resources to be able to send troops to Iran .
So there is great likelihood that Israel may act alone .
Although Israel has greater air and ground superiority then Iran , Iran has larger numbers of troops and have long range missles that can reach Israel .
Israel in the past has sucessfully fought off nations with larger numbers of troops before a prime example being the six day war .
So would Israel be able to act alone or would US military intervention still be required to attack Iran ?
Israel would find it hard enough to conduct air raids on Iran , let alone fighting a large scale war .
The distances are simply too great for Israel to be able to project much power against Iran .
I do n't think Israel could act alone .
If they attacked Iran unilaterally , it would probably be a large mission aimed at taking out Iran 's nuclear infrastructure .
They would have a hard go of it .
Iran in retaliation would launch its long range missiles at Israel , as well as encouraging Hezbollah to harass Israel .
I think any Israeli action against Iran would involve bringing the US into the war , I think its the only way Israel can really do enough damage to make the whole effort worthwhile .
I have been searching for sometime now , and I can n't seem to find a dropshipper that sales merchandise low enough so I could profit from it .
Would someone please help me ?
Hi , Nobody is going to give you their sources .
You are going to have to find them on your own .
There are plenty out there but most of them are more trouble than they are worth .
There are also a very few that are good suppliers but you have to realize , when dropshipping , the profit margin is VERY thin and you have to be on top of them all the time , monitoring their inventory .
People find a dropshipper , sign up and then list , list , and list !
They list soooo much but then when it comes to monitoring the inventory they do not check back into the site to see if the inventory is still available .
You CAN have a successful business with dropshippers but it is W*O*R*K .
It is not E*A*S*Y .
I found all my sources by surfing the net on my cellphone during commercials , while waiting in line , any spare moment .
Search several different ways , most do not even have the word "@ dropship @" on their site .
Good Luck .
And beware of "@ membership clubs @" such as Doba and the like .
They are not your solution .
Real distributors do not charge you for taking your money .
Still , making any drop shipping work in the DSR @-@ feedback @-@ oriented quick ship ebay world will be a challenge .
Please do a quick search and you will find tons of info on drop shipping @...@ here is a thread from the recent past http://forums.ebay.com/db1/topic/Building-An-Ebay/Using-A-Drop/5200052702?#msg5200760329
which is only of about 25 @+ since the beginning of the year .
I am sorry but until eBay pins the drop shipping topic all you can do is search older posts .
I can not give you the formula for success , but I can give you the formula for failure -- which is @: Try to please everybody . Herbert Bayard Swope
My partners and I refuse to use dropshipping .
If a dropshipper has 100 items for example and we sell 107 to 107 different people then we have 7 potential unhappy customers with the potential for 7 negative feedbacks .
A dropshipper is only concerned with selling their 100 items as fast as they can .
I am concerned with selling the 100 items that are in our inventory as best and correctly as possible .
This is just my opinion @.....
OK @...@ I know the answer to that but it still really bothers me .
This is what was waiting for me when I logged into facebook this afternoon
NO ! eBay should issue a coupon for buyers to use on our listings and get 15 % off @....
we would still get our full $$ and eBay can give the seller the difference that the buyer saves !
Just really bugs me
Because that is additional revenue outside of seller .

yup @..@ I knew the answer but still hate it !
Sorry , long story .
First off a little info @..
Marshall amplification has been one of the leading guitar amplifier companies for 50 years .
Many of the older amps are being restored and also there are countless companies offering clones and cloned replacement parts for DIY'ers .
Since I like wood working I thought some folks would enjoy an amplifier shell that they could finish themselves and either use it to restore an old Marshall amplifier or to collect aftermarket parts from countless other vendors and end up with a Vintage Marshall clone .
So , I have had pretty good luck selling these wooden amp head shells in the past and thought I would reintroduce my product .
Well , Ebay pulled my listing for having the word "@ Marshall @" in the title .
My actual listing read "@ Marshall style plexi / JCM800 headshell for project . @"
Notice the word "@ style @" .
I did a quick ebay search using "@ Marshall style @" and came up with 100 's of listings that use that term for after market parts and kits .
The listings I clicked on were NOT actaul Marshall products .
I also searched another famous amplifier company and typed in "@ Fender style @" .
Again 100 's of listings for aftermarket parts and kits .
Why was I singled out when there are 1,000 's and 1,000 's of people listing this way ?
And its clear that I did not claim it was an actual "@ Marshall @" product which is why I put the word "@ style @" in the listing .
Does not seem right .
People who are looking for these items will n't find them without knowing that it is for a Marshall or Marshall style amp .
I love the smell of packaging tape in the morning .
Can n't use the manufacturer 's name in the title unless the item being listed is actually made by the manufacturer .
eBay rules - not mine .
Michael 's right - someone somewhere decided to report you , and you ended up getting a wrist @-@ slap .
You -@ could @- start reporting all the "@ style @" listings you found and ( hopefully ) watch them go away .
Sometimes it only takes one report @... sometimes you gotta stay on top of it for a while .
There are special rules for what you want to do , offering non @-@ brand replacement components ( in your case , the wood case ) .
Unfortunately , I just do n't recall what they all are @...
there 's a way to word the description that works and does n't get you slapped for "@ keyword spamming @" ( which is what putting Marshall in the descriptive text will earn you ) .
Fun stuff , eh ?
That sounds right @...
as long as it does n't fall into the NOT ALLOWED category by meeting this criteria @:
Using "@ compatible with , @" "@ fits , @" or "@ for @" before a brand name in the title of your listing to describe items that are universally compatible or that are compatible with an entire product class
Just know if it is someone that is "@ after you @" ( which sometimes happens ) - there is ALWAYS some violation that you are breaking or you are near the questionable portion of breaking some policy .
Because eBay will usually "@ pull first ask later @" when a listing is reported , your listings will only become better and you may just sell more because of what you learn on how to become a better seller as you refine your listings .
If you keep a good sense of humor and communicate with eBay @... eBay will start "@ ask first pull later @" .
Hello ,
I wonder if someone can clear something up for me ?
I have a £ 63,950 SVR mortgage with Halifax with 19 1 / 2 years left . ( it 's currently £ 64,570 due to some stupidity a few yrs ago ) .
Now , this was originally taken out as interest only but when I 've phoned a couple of years ago to increase the payment they have changed it to "@ part interest , part repayment @" . Not too fussed about this as I 've worked out the numbers and the correct amount is coming off the capital every month .
I 'm going to contact Halifax for details on how to make overpayments as I 've increased my direct debit again but would like to be able to make ad @-@ hoc overpayments when I 'm able to .
Thing I 'm curious about is the 10 % overpayment thing - I know my mortgage agreement is subject to this however what does it really mean ? Should I only be paying 10 % more than my interest only payments or is it 10 % extra off the capital ? My new direct debit ( as of end Dec 12 would take me over the 10 % of IO payments ) .
I 'm guessing they will give me a rough idea of how much I can overpay in £ s based on my current direct debit but would be interested to know beforehand just for my knowledge .
Currently Halifax have on their records that "@ Pensions @" will be paying the capital off at the end of the term - these are currently non existent so trying to get myself at least on track for repayment at the end of term .
Thanks very much !
its 10 % of the mortgage balance for the year , so if your mortgage balance in £ 100,000 that year you can overpay by £ 10,000 during the course of the year without penalty .
However , if you are on the SVR you do n't have the 10 % limit , just overpay as much as you can comfortably afford
Quote @:
Are you sure you 're on SVR ? Or just a rate that is soon to end ?
Having worked for Halifax it is indeed correct that once you 've reached the SVR then no overpayment limits are enforced you are simply free to overpay as much as you wish to .
This is correct . Your KFI / Mortgage Offer may say something along the lines of '@ in any one year you may repay up to 10 % of the amount outstanding on your special rate product @' . It 's a rolling 12 months , so the year starts when you make your 1 st overpayment . So , you could n't pay £ 10 k in december and another £ 10 k in january for instance , you 'd need to wait 12 months .
Then , once your '@ special rate product @' ends , you go onto SVR , with no overpayment restrictions .
Hi , I 'm in the middle of a divorce and am trying to take on the mortgage on the family home .
I 'm only trying to borrow about 16 % of my home 's current market value , which is about twice my annual income .
Have approached several big lenders and tried going through a financial adviser , but noone will lend because my income is made up of @: 4 very part-time jobs ( 2 employed , 2 self @-@ employed ) , maintenance ( not yet Court ordered ) and tax credits .
Their argument is that once my daughter leaves school some of these income sources will cease , but by then I would hope to be back at work full time ( she 's only 7 ! ) .
The mortgage rates I 've been quoted are less than I 'm paying at the moment anyway !
It 's been suggested to me that I try and take out a personal loan instead ?
Anyone got any suggestions ?
You would think that having 4 part time jobs that at least you will have 2 at any one time and that is more secure than having 1 full time job and possibly being given notice to leave .
It sounds like you are self employed and will need the assistance of an accountant to create some books that show some decent profit combining all the sources of income streams as one source of income .
They may be doing an affordability calculation instead of a income multiple and do n't think you can afford to pay for day to day living expenses and a mortgage .
I would get another financial advisor who can help you .
Someone should be able to lend you the money .
Hi all , I currently have a mortgage which what used to be Northern Rock .
I took the mortgage out in 2007 , fixed rate for 5 years .
This is due to finish in June .
I do n't know what to do !
I took the mortgage out with my then husband , we split two years ago .
He did all the money side of things so have no idea where to go .
I have a funny feeling that since house prices have dropped , I am likely to be in negative equity .
We borrowed more than 100 % , retrospectively a stupid thing to do .
I have taken the mortgage on on my own .
Any advice would be gratefully received , thank you .
In rate terms , there 's nothing you can do .
If you are in negative equity as you seem to think , there is no prospect of another lender taking you on , so a remortgage is n't going to be possible .
NRAM / UKAR which is the body managing your mortgage does not offer replacement or customer retention products , so your mortgage will revert to the follow @-@ on rate set out in your original Key Facts Illustration ( KFI ) or mortgage offer .
This is likely to be the standard variable rate , currently 4.79 % .
Given theat the current lending and borrowing siatuion , it is more difficult for people to get a Mortgage .
I understand that Martgage broker is to be able to see from a lot of providers .
But for people are dififcult to get mortgage today , is their advise is worthy @...
Say for instance they say it is better you ask for this provider but in fact , when you afollow their suggestion , you get rejected ?
Is not that it is better to sticj to your bak who knows wel your financial stability and ability ??
I undesratnd that some mortgage adviser are free of charge .
I am asking here because once you get rejected it will seriously danage your credibility to get another lender ?
Opinions and expereince from people in ths forum are really appreciated @....
First of all I disagree that its harder to get a mortgage @...@ compared to the days of 100 % @+ mortgages yes but for the right applicants there is plenty of lending available .
Obviously I am biased as I am an independent mortgage adviser but my view is it is good that we can source the whole market finding the best deals and knowing the specific lending criteria of each lender .
I used to work for a bank and I would never offer my services to my friends and family as I did n't know whether there were better services elsewhere .
Now I am comfortable doing things for my friends and family .
Banks will want you to think that you have a better chance of getting a mortgage with them as you have your finances with them but this is simply not true .
If you get rejected you need to look into the reasons why @...@ affordability @..@ credit score etc.
Hi My husband and I are looking to buy the hosue we currently live in , but we do not have a deposit .
Are there any 100 % mortgages out there and which ones are the best to look at -
I am totally useless when it comes to things like this and hubby is no better !!!
I currently earn about £ 21 k a year and hubby earns just under £ 15 k a year .
What is the likelyhood of us getting a mortgage to start off with and is going to be more difficult to find 100 % one ?
Any advice would be appreciated . Thanks
Whats the value of your house ? ,
hows both your credit rating ?
This seems to be the 2 most important factors when considering a mortgage other than your joint income .
The chance of getting a 100 % is probably impossible to be honest @...
A shared ownership property is one where you do not buy the property outright , but only a percentage share of the property . For example only 25 % .
However on the remaining 75 % which is still owned by the housing association , you will pay a monthly rent .
So if you are not looking at this types of properties , you will not get a 100 % mortgage .
Hello all - just joined and after some advice .
I 've seen the posts on the forum relating to the Nationwide consent to let and subsequent hike in interest rates by 1.5 % ( this is going back a year or two ) .
At the time my wife and I were renting out our property and had signed up to a 5 year fixed rate mortgage .
We initially lived in the property but subsequently let it out having received permission to do so from Nationwide .
Given we were in a fixed rate mortgage and had paid for the extra security i was pretty shocked and appalled that they were forcing this increase on us .
In any case my wife went to Nationwide to discuss our options with the mortgage adviser .
The long and short of it is that the mortgage adviser gave the advice that given base rate was 0.5 % and we could move to another lender on a formal BTL mortgage for a far lower rate ( given with the 1.5 % increase our Nationwide rate would be over 7 % ) and therefore over a the mortgage term more than cover the early repayment fee .
This advice made perfect sense so we paid to come out of our fixed rate with Nationwide and moved to another lender - the early repayment fee was circa £ 3 k .
Subsequently we received the letter from Nationwide ( as I am sure many did ) saying that those on fixed rate mortgages that would have to pay early redemption fees would not have the 1.5 % increase imposed until the end of the term of the fixed rate .
Given the advice we received and subsequent redemption fee we paid ( prior to Nationwide changing their minds ) I wonder whether anyone thinks we have any recourse against Nationwide .
Be very interested in any thoughts .
Many thanks
It definitely sounds interesting .
I would certainly go to the branch , speak to someone in management and present this letter along with any documentary evidence that you may have had from your previous meeting .
Also get them to produce the notes of your previous meeting with the mortgage adviser .
we came within a gnats whisker of paying a 7 k early redemption fee to avoid the 1.5 % hike .
thankfully the letter arrived a day before our completion date on our new mortgage so we were able to get out of it .
only 15 months until we can leave nationwide and move over to a proper btl mortgage .
Are there any bridging companies who 'll do a loan for an uninhabitable property ( it 's derelict ) ?
We need to borrow 55 % of the hammer price until we can get planning permission for restoration which will allow us to get a mortgage
( verbal approval of our plans has been given by the local planning officer and the building society in question ) .
( Excuse me while I do a little - this is a building we nearly bought through normal channels 5 years ago , got gazumped on and never thought we 'd ever get another crack at it ! )
It does n't seem likely and would be horrendously expensive .
Look at it from the lender 's point of view @:
This is high risk - if you do n't get planning approval the site could actually be worth a negative amount ( due to demolition costs ) .
Verbal approval is essentially worth nothing .
On the flip side there is little return for the lender as you do n't want the loan for long so not much time to charge interest .
Really you would be better off @: Getting a mortgage not a bridging loan ( also difficult ) . Getting an unsecured loan to buy it initially .
Be aware that almost no bank or building society will give a mortgage on a property after it has been bought , if it was bought less than 6 months ago .
I do n't know the answer to your question , but it sounds very risky to me .
You will be taking on a costly short-term loan based only on verbal promises which may not eventually come good .
What happens if the B Soc does n't eventually make an offer , or it 's at a much lesser amount than you hope for ?
Does it know that the house is uninhabitable - usually that makes a property unmortgeable .
Or if the PP takes much longer to be considered because there are objections / it 's refused and you have to appeal etc. ?
Last time we got a thread like this , I suggested Tiuta and the OP did some research and found the cost was prohibitive .
I echo the other comment about how you deal with being unable to remortgage if something goes wrong and would ask you to note you 'll have to stick with the bridging finance for around eight months as you will n't be able to apply for the remortgage until you 've owned the property for six .
Caution needed .
Bridging is only possible where the lender believes you will live elsewhere .
They can not lend on a property you will be living in as this then falls into FSA regulation , which bridging is excluded from .
An alternate to bridging is a non status mortgage , but the lender will still need to survey the property and carry out the nusual due dilligence to include full legal conveyancing and checks .
The reason most aution deals are cash is that lending is NEVER guaranteed and can fall through at the mast moment , meaning the applicant looses the property and thier 10 % deposit .
You 'll need a good deal of luck to get this through using lending .
Also bridgers usualy want a clearly defined exit route , and it will n't be sufficient to say a remortgage should be possible subject to all manner of property repairs ( what if you fall ill / go mad / get depressed part way into the renovation for example ) .
Hi all , current mortgage fixed deal ends in March and this will be the first time remortgaging .
Purchased the property March 2009 .
The property was valued at £ 102000 when we purchased it and we now owe £ 77000 .
I am interested in learning more about how valuations work when remortgaging .
Do they come round ?
Are there any ways I can improve the potential result ?
What happens ?
Nothing much has changed since last valuation in or out the property .
To be honest I would be happy with £ 102000 valuation but guess we will find out .
Any information anyone can provide about this process would be great .
Are you remortgaging to a new lender , or doing a product transfer with the current one ?
If it 's the latter , chances are your current lender will use a desktop system called HomeTrack .
If you are moving your mortgage to a new lender , it will normally ask a surveyor to visit the property to establish its value .
As you are right on the 75 % borderline for the better products , I would imagine an inspection would be better for you .
Talk to your current lender before you start shopping around .
It 's been solved now .
thanks for everyone
Why on earth would you allow somebody else to sort out payslips and P60 for you ?
If you had proof of income why not provide it ?
You have been complicit in any fraudulent application by allowing it to happen with full knowledge .
Struggling to see how you could compain to the lender and CAB when you applied fraudulently .
I suspect you are now registered as a fraudulent applicant and will struggle to gain finance anywhere .
Hi , I 've a dilema !
Looking to remortgage , and have found suitable product from Yorkshire Building Society . £ 195 non @-@ refundable application fee , conveyancing and valuation free .
It is a 75 % LTV .
My house is worth VERY close to the 75 % mark .
If I apply , and the valuation comes out lower , I 'd have to pick the next best product , which is actually Santander .
Santander valued for free at £ 180000 , which is the amount we estimated it to be .
Mortgage balance is £ 134000 , so as you can see , very close to the 75 % .
I could just go with Santander ,
no fees , but would cost me additional £ 1700 over the 3 year fixed term .
Do I risk losing the £ 195 ?
I suppose only I can answer that , but any thoughts or tips ?
You appear to have done the maths and identified the pitfalls .
If there 's no way of avoiding that fee , you appear to have to risk it .
Is n't there a product with no fees you could choose upto 75 % so you 'd lose nothing if the property is downvalued ?
Lenders I have spoken to say that while their valuation fee is '@ free @' , you still have to pay for it but it is refunded if you go ahead .
I guess it 's not always the case ( only spoke to 2 lenders , and perhaps I only discussed it with one of them ) .
It 's one of the reasons why I 'm not remortgaging at the moment - found a great 80 % rate but could go the wrong way of the house is valued lower than expected .
Just to also say , YBS are quite strict on affordability too not just LTV ,
their online affordability calculator is quite close .
Santander are not as strict .
Good evening people ,
Was looking for a little advise in regards to the possible mis @-@ selling by a mortgage broker of a 100 % intrest only mortgage .
My partner signed up for a 100 % intrest only mortgage with the Nothern Rock mortgage but to realise it was a intrest only mortgage some 5 years down the line .
The reason I feel that may have a case to be answered is that surely mortgage company must take some precautions when selling an intrest only mortgage
i.e. the customer must take out some sort of endowment to ensure that when the mortgage intrest is finally paid off then the customer would be in a financial position to pay of the actual amount the mortgage was agreed for ???
The mortgage broker who advised obviously has a case to answer but are nothern rock in the wrong aswell ?
Any information that can be offered would be greatly appreciated .
No , there is not .
Read the paperwork she got when she took out the mortgage - it will explain that you need to set up a repayment vehicle for the capital amount .
I would also be amazed if the broker did not also advise her of this .
Unfortunately this was quite a common problem , particularly with young first time buyers who have no real clue about mortgages .
This was a problem during the boom years in that banks were not checking if customers had a repayment vehicle in place , hence they were throwing these interest only mortgages at people because that 's all they could afford because house prices were so high .
There are people on here who will deny this ever took place .
Many people put a lot of faith in some of these brokers in the belief that they were acting in their best interests .
Unfortunately there is probably little come back because ultimately your partner should have read closely what she was getting into before she signed .
I know that might sound callous but there is the saying that covers this which is '@ buyer beware @' .
Where do we go from here ?
Some stocks have had a great run since early March
is it time to cash in and wait for the next drop or have we bottomed and its a steady rise from here ?
I would like to here from anyone who saw the last recession , late eighties , pan out and how the sectors reacted .
I viewed charts from then ,
it shows volatility till '@ 92 before a general steady rise although different sectors behaved differently
Any thoughts appreciated
Quote @: Agree with Purchy .
I think we 'll be rangebound for quite a few years .
Except there is a good chance that commodities and commodity stocks will spike violently upwards for a while in a year or so ( higher than they were in 2008 ) , thanks to supply destruction which may well have a coiled spring effect .
Also inflation and a falling dollar should help them go up as well @..
There is also good reason to believe that commodities will rise over the long terma s well .
Hi , 1 st time posting so please bear with me !
I am due to receive approx 20 K from sale of deceased parental home and need to find somewhere to put it .
have used up my isa allowance ( so has hubby ) may need to access all our funds within the next 12 month as we will either be moving home or doing self build if nothing suitable comes on market .
therefore need to be able to access funds without too much penalty / notice .
Have 2 kids and wonder if i could put money in children accounts for better tax free interest or do you have any suggestions please ?
Thanks in advance for any help
Based on what you have said , you should not invest but stick to savings .
Check out the usual tables on this site for interest rates .
If you put money into the name of your child it becomes his beneficially .
In any case see http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/tdsi/children.htm for tax treatment of interest on money given to children by parents .
You could always hold the cash in an on @-@ line account ( AA paying 3.2 % gross ) until April
then each of you can put £ 5640 into a cash ISA ?
Hi An elderly relative ( late 80 s lives in annex adjoining the house ) has banked with lloyds all her life - and she asked me for some general advice .
I was n't at all familiar with her financial situation and she has in the past been advised by Lloyds .
What appears to be the case is that she has @: £ 150 k+ in an OEIC / shares ISA with Scottish Widows £ 30 k in easy access savings account paying 2 % with lloyds £ 15 k in current account with Lloyds £ 5 k in cash ISA with lloyds
What struck me was that she has all her savings in Lloyds / Scottish Widows so well over the £ 85 k protection limit .
Also that she had been advised to put so much in OEIC / corporate bonds / shares ISAs as it appears her capital has been fluctuating ( generally down ) .
She invested this whilst in her 80 s so am struggling to see how it would be good advice to ask her to put so much in a scheme where capital is not protected .
Anyhow we have booked an appointment next week to go through this with me in support .
Do others think this advice is strange ?
And what would others advise .
My instinct is to get her into good savings accounts where capital is not at risk and to split it across 3 different institutions ( it seems you can can get 3 % @+ if you keep an eye on the rates being offered ) , plus make sure she uses all the ISA allowance each year
Any thoughts / commented would be appreciated ? David
I 'd be reluctant to start messing with an elderly relative 's finances .
Others in the family might accuse you of all sorts when she dies .
That said @: 1 ) If she 's of sound mind you need to understand if she 's prepared to move from LTSB or not .
Another bank may confuse her significantly .
2 ) If she wants to stay with LTSB , support her in finding the best home for her money from their range , but also help her to keep it in a good paying account , as most of their accounts have 12 month bonuses .
3 ) Make sure you do n't do anything with cash ISA that could impact her stocks and shares ISA .
4 ) Get her agreement to shift money from the current account to a better savings account ( even if it 's only the 2 % one ) .
Just because somebody 's old does n't mean that capital should be protected .
My biggest concern for her would be if she owns a property .
There 's a high chance of an IHT bill on the horizon .
I 'd be talking to an IFA about the best ways to mitigate this .
As dunstonh suggests , the shares will effectively be in her name and are n't relevant to the protection scheme .
This is a very tough one .
Banks generally will do what 's best for them which is invariably bad for the customers .
There is a lot of evidence these are some of the worst routes to market due to them often having the highest costs .
As mentioned though , change is never fun , especially when it could be confusing and misunderstood .
I would personally say she should find an IFA and pay upfront for advice ( ie no commissions ) so she gets what is most suitable for her .
Given her age it 's standard practice to have less money in equity and more in guaranteed income than she currently appears to have due to short term fluctuations .
I 'm probably going to get criticized for what I 'm about to write , but as a long time lurker on these forums I know that I can also expect some sensible and honest opinions .
I have been having a relationship with a married man for some time now and I 'm starting to get fed up with the situation and wonder if this is all it 's ever going to be .
How likely is it that a married man would leave his wife for the '@ other woman @' , How do I know if he 's serious about me or just toying with me ?
I know he does love me , but that 's not always enough is it ?
I am really torn at the moment whether to let things carry on , or to walk away .
Likelihood of him leaving his wife for you , slim to none .
Even if he does could you live your life happily ?
If he can do it to his wife , would he have qualms about doing it to his girlfriend ?
1 . The person you are having the affair with is cheating on his wife .
If he does it once , he could do it again - remember the old saying "@ when a man marries his mistress , it leaves a vacancy - for the next mistress @" .
2 . Quite simply , he is cheating , you are cheating .
There are all the excuses in the world "@ he will leave when the children are older / when his wife is better / when they 've sorted out finances - just waiting for the right time to tell her @" blah , blah blah , blah !
If you have any integrety , you would walk away now .
Are you in a relationship with anybody ? or are you single
He 's having his cake and eating it at the moment ?
Why would he want to give that up ?
I 'm struggling for ideas as to what to do for my birthday this week .
DH will be at work , DS at school and DD at nursery till 12 pm unless i choose to take her out for the day so i can go somwhere till 3.15 pm .
In some ways i envy my DH who has a July birthday that generally falls within schools holidays and we are all around him with good weather .
On mine its generally dull , raining or cold and everyone is working .
This year I 've thougth and thought about what I can do either on my own or maybe with my almost 4 year old .
My Mum suggested I go over with her to visit my dad who 's on a house sit and have a sandwich with them at lunchtime and open my pressie .
This seems to be my best option but its not what i would choose to do or really want to do .
My parents have chosen to do this house sit , i really do n't mind but I 'm not sure i want to go over , walk the dog and sit in a strangers house for a couple of hours to pass the time .
Any thoughts please on what you grown ups do for January birthdays when the weather is rubbish and your friends are working .
I do n't expect to be entertained and happy to potter around or go to a National Trust / Swimming , but my local pool doens't have an open swim on thurs suitable for my availability and i do n't have a car free to drive .
Hmmmm @....... its quandry !
Chalk it up to one those things that happens when you have kids and do something at the weekend instead .
Mine was on the 13 th .
( ETA @: had I had the money , I would have gone off for a couple of hours and a coffee at the nicest garden centre near to where I live so I could get there by bus )
go for a meal with your DH in the evening after his work , and get your parents to babysit ?
day time wise - how much money do you want to spend ?
Get your nails / hair etc. done ?
Depends what youre in to .
i do n't normally do anything in the day time for my bday ,
Id do something at the nearest weekend or that night .
I 'm trying to muster some sympathy for you but I 'm sorry I really can n't .
My birthday is in January too , and most year I have to work . For the whole day !!!!
This year , I worked all day , could n't celebrate with my dd because she was working in the evening , so I went out for a bite to eat with a couple of friends and then on to see a film .
I 'll celebrate my birthday with my dd when we both have some time together @... in February .
Your parents want to see you and spend some time with you , give you a present so be gracious ( and a bit mature ) and go !
hi , i am getting married on february 18 th 2012 and i am planning on buying a gift for my wife to be .
She loves tiffany and i bought her the chunky link bracelet with heart in the first few months that we were together so now i am thinking to get her the necklace .
Is the official tiffany Uk website the only place to buy official and not fake items or are there other places that sell tiffany ?
plus anyone else have any other similar ideas ??
looked at links of london and pandora but I 'm not sure @....
Sounds lovely .
The only place to buy genuine Tiffany is the website or Tiffany shops .
The only place to get Tiffany cheaper is the airport shops abroad , if the exchange rate / duty free combination works in your favour .
Having the matching necklace is a lovely idea .
If she likes charms you could get the Links sweetie bracelet - then you have the next few presents sorted out for the charms .
OH came home from work on Monday evening by taxi and found 3 men trying to break into the house .
They set upon him , knocked him to the floor and kicked him several times in head and stomach , stole his mobile phone and bag and ran off .
The police came out very quickly , did a drive around with OH and the cabby but did n't see them that night .
They took DH 's bag ( which they found dumped a few streets away ) and said they would forensically test it , and there was a CCTV camera which covered the area and the cabby said he could definitely identify the men as he got a clear view .
DH has not been asked to give a statement , and we assume nor has the cabby .
He got a letter in the post this morning , dated Tuesday , saying the police were closing their investigation .
The detective in charge has n't answered phone calls and his bag has n't been returned to him , which contained business papers and clothes .
DH did need treatment at A and E after the attack
It seems pretty clear that the police did not bother with forensic testing and may not even have checked the CCTV footage .
Is there anything which can be done to challenge their decision not even to do a preliminary investigation into an attempted burglary and common assault , where there are witnesses to the attack ?
If it is relevant at all , DH has no previous convictions , arrests or anything similar with the police , and is a middle aged businessman set upon by 20 year old males of a different racial background to us .
no , something is wrong here .
They can n't just '@ close an investigation @' the day afterwards , not having even taken statements .
I 'd say get some legal advice , or write to the Police , stating what you 've put in your post above and ask for an explanation .
you could try posting this on the moneysaving in marriage and relationships board ?
you might get more answers there .
I would get down to the police station sooner than just writing a letter .
If CCTV needs to be examined and has not yet been looked at , you want it seized asap , before it is recorded over .
It is of course possible that the CCTV was n't working on the day in question but I am still surprised no other forensic examinations have taken place .
If a full note of your OH 's / the cabby 's evidence was taken in a police notebook then the need for an immediate witness statement is reduced .
If this is really true , start here @: http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/en/Pages/default.aspx
BUT ! Be prepared to be stopped for motoring offences by disgruntled coppers for the next 10 or so years @........
Make a formal complaint .
The police are trying to fiddle the figures .
Was it even recorded as a crime ?
Ask for the crime number and see .
I 'm actually V excited as it all seems like fun , but all ex leaders are V cynical ?
I think as with everything from reading this thread there 's always the politics and the ooo could you just do a bit more for us aspect , we 'll have to keep our mouths firmly zipped .
I 'm looking to trying to start volunteering sometime in the near future and was a rainbow / brownie / guide when younger and think i might enjoy helping out but have no idea how to make the first steps to get involved
Hi All I am looking for advice please .
DD1 is in further education -
because the course she wanted to do is n't available near us she is in residential college and we pay her accommodation and food costs ,
it leaves things very tight , but as we felt this was a great opportunity for her we were prepared to do it .
She also has the use of a car as its easier ( and a lot cheaper ) than us driving her back and forth most weeks .
DD2 is due to leave school next summer and is hoping to start a hairdressing apprenticeship .
She started to talk about driving lessons ( a bit premature I know ) and us buying a car and paying for petrol and insurance .
I mentioned to her that as she will be earning an income it will be time for her to start paying us towards her keep , etc.
She thinks that will be very unfair as we are still paying for her older sister .
Any suggestions please - we are prepared to take the money and put it away for her future ( although I would n't admit that to her as she would want it sooner rather than later ) .
I do see her point , but am not prepared to let her get away with not paying anything .
Thanks for reading .
Does her sister earn any money ?
If she does n't , then you could speak to them both about the contributions you expect from them when they both start earning .
As for the car - Did you pay for DD1s lessons ?
It seems unfair to not pay for DD2s if you did , and then to allow access to the car .
I do n't see why she would expect her own car if her sister shares yours , although you will have to think about priorities for who needs the car and what you will do if both want the car !
Letting her get away without paying anything will n't teach her anything for the future , but equally if she does't get the same treatment as her sister she 'll probably feel quite upset .
My grandaughter is in the final year of 3 of a hairdressing course ,
she has to work part-time in a salon but does n't earn very much and the stuff she has had to buy / keep replacing for the course has been very expensive @.. so my daughter has had to help her by not actually taking any keep money as long as she is on the course @..
its meant my grandaughter has managed to pay for all her own clothes , fares , lunches , and going out money over the course @..
my daughter was happy that she 'd found something she wanted to do and was able to near enough support herself through it @..
as I said at the beginning as an apprentice she will be earning peanuts @..
I agree with what is being said TW .
To support DD1 to the tune that you are and then to expect DD2 to pay into the household on what I 'm sure will be a much less than minimum wage apprenticeship seems like a double blow to DD2 to me ! and I can appreciate her frustration .
I do think that whilst DD2 is doing her apprenticeship she should be allowed to retain her wages .
You should explain to her that this is your way of ensuring that they are both treated equally in what are very different circumstances .
However I would also make clear that once either of them begin to earn a full time wage outside of college or apprenticeship that they will be expected to contribute to the house if they continue to live there !
I wish you well .
I 'm sorry but I can see your DD2 's point -
you say you would support her if she went to college but even though you agree that the apprenticeship would be a better career choice you 're prepared to penalise her for it .
If she was leaving school to get a normal job I would agree she should contribute but this is basically her still studying , just going about it in a slightly less conventional way .
Has she arranged to apply for this herself ?
That to me shows a lot of intitative and motivation for someone her age ,
rather then taking the more mainstream option of college she has looked into her options and gone for what will be best for her future career .
Apprentice wages are extremely low so while she is on those could you maybe look at a compromise -
eg you will still provide her room and board ( the same as you are doing for her sister ) but she has to pay all her expenses out of her wage , ie her travel to work , lunches there if she needs them , phone if she has it , any expenses she needs for work .
hmmmmmm hard one here !
Normally I would say yes , take a nominal amount from your DD2 as she is now "@ working @" , but as you are supporting DD1 , I can see why she might be cheesed off .
I guess it depends on how much she is earning during her first year as an apprentice @......
Lets say , for talks sake , it 's £ 100 a week ,
that 's still a lot of money for a school leaver who has no household expenses or food to pay .
Personally I would take a small amount , say £ 20 a week from her and , as you said , put it in a savings account for if she does decide to go travelling in the future .
Explain to here that it may not seem fair , but she is now earning , and the cost of this compared to living away from home , is minimal . Or show her a breakdown of what a 1 / 3 of all household cost would be .
In regards to the car , does your DD1 really NEED one ?
Of course it is easier for her to get home at weekends , but can she not get the train / bus ?
When I was at uni , I think I could count the number of students who lived away from home and had a car on one hand - the rest mnade do with a young persons railcard .
And will your DD2 NEED a car ?
If the answer if no , neither of them really need it then I would suggest that they share the car ( 1 month on / off , for example ) .
A car for a teenager / student , is an expensive luxury and with the rising costs of insurance and fuel , most parents can not this for one child , let alone 2 .
It begins and ends with Romneycare .
If Obama never pushed Obaminationcare , then Romney would be running away with the nomination !
Funny he was considered the most conservative option in 2008 !
Rush , Levin , Hannity , Savage etc. all said Romney was the conservative candidate .
Fast forward to 2012 and now he is the liberal candidate .
Nothing change , EXCEPT the passing of Obaminationcare !
I think you draw the wrong interpretation of 2008 .
He was n't the most conservative , Huckabee was .
And Huckabee was sincere .
What you forget about all those talking heads is that they are all paid by big corporations .
The real problem is that Corporate Conservatism and Social Conservatism are n't on the same page .
The big corporations do n't give a shit about Abortion or Gay Marriage or gettin @' Jay-a-zus into your life .
They just want laws friendly to Wall Street , and Romney is that guy .
Huckabee actually believed in all that Jay-a-zus shit , and that scared the corporate guys .
Here 's the ugly little truth .
The religious right could win elections without the corporate right .
Easily .
They 'd even have an easier time of it , because a lot of religious people vote Democrats and are n't fooled into voting against their own economic interests .
One of the most lucid , reasonable descriptions of Romney I 've seen yet , well done .
The guy is awkward and does n't connect .
There are obviously plenty of people like that , it does n't make you evil , but it 's obviously a significant handicap when you 're running for President .
Add that to the fact that he just seems so eager to please , and you have a guy who is n't easy to trust .
What ?
Liberals are finding something wrong with Romney ?
Unbelievable !
If you want to pretend that Romney is perfect , okay , your call , I see it with partisans on both sides all the time .
It is possible , however , to admit weaknesses in candidates from your party without being arrested .
It is possible to be reasonable and honest , too .
Read the post I made right after that one .
Apology accepted .
As I 'm pretty sure that the OP was asking Republican voters , I will answer .
Keep in mind that even though I 'm a registered Republican I am decidedly Libertarian .
Romney has a credibility issue with me .
Even after I put aside all the things that I disagree with him on ( Me , being a Libertarian ) I just can not trust him to do the things I would expect of a Republican .
I am not convinced that he will repeal obamacare , I am not convinced that he will reduce government spending , and I am not convinced that he will run the country like a businessman .
Having followed the last 2 presidential races , ( 9 in total ) I am familiar with Romney , and familiar with what he says compared to wht he has done and what he has said .
That 's what is wrong with Romney , and what is right about Romney is that with all his faults , he 's 10 times better than obama .
why would you think the o/p is asking "@ republicans @" .
i 've voted republican enough times where I 'm probably the better gauge .
just sayin
thank you though for pointing out what the real problem is @...
it 's the rightwingnut base and the difficulties of appealing to it if one is a normal moderate person .
btw , you are n't a libertarian if you 're anti @-@ choice .
just sayin
Jumping with both feet right into a pile of bull shit are n't you .
I am and have always been pro @-@ choice all the way across the board .
In every area , I am pro choice , pro freedom .
Which makes me an enemy of obama .
then you have my apology and it makes unique among so-called "@ libertarians @" on this board .
carry on .
Looks like you made the post after I did , did n't you .
No apology needed .
And the Bush Twins too .
It 's only a one way street with TM and crew you know .
Now once the children become celebs on their own they are free game .
The Bush twins have not pursued this angle however one Palin child has .
And she dances like a horse .
Really ??
So are you going to claim that Trig @...
Willow etc. became a celeb on theri own then ?
Because the nastynesshas not been not just aimed at Bristol .
Also care to explain the nastyness that came from your side prior to DWTS ?
You do know it was heaped on them before that @...
right ?
Sorry @...
you lose .
Bristol aso got nearly 1 / 4 million from a non profit to promote NON teen pregnancy .
She got out on the circuit before dancing with the Starz .
Making 1 / 4 mill off of her getting pregnant ?
Or capitolizing on her mothers fame ?
Do you guys even remember how you have treated Hilary and pelosi ?
Boxer and Di Fi ?
Amy Carter when she was but a child ?
Chelsea ?
You never seen to mind women being treated like crap unless its some right wing woman .
No , I do n't Please elaborate .
On his TV show , early in the Clinton administration , Limbaugh put up a picture of Socks , the White House cat , and asked , '@ Did you know there 's a White House dog ?
' Then he put up a picture of Chelsea Clinton , who was 13 years old at the time and as far as I know had never done any harm to anyone .
When viewers objected , he claimed , in typical Limbaugh fashion , that the gag was an accident and that without his permission some technician had put up the picture of Chelsea -- which I found as disgusting as his original attempt at humor .

So @...
were you idignant ??
Outraged ??
If so @...
you have no business excusing it from your own side .
Sorry @...
"@ so and so did it too @" does n't cut it outside of kindergarden .
So ??
This automatically gives you and others the right to call her nasty names and attack her looks , body , sexuality etc. ??
Funny , I seem to remember a recent thread about how ugly black women are .
Hmmm , maybe it was only racist ?
Oh @...
you mean the posts where people here were claiming Condolezza Rice looked like a man ?
Yes @...
I saw those too .
Sure she made herself a public figure by her choice and action .
Same as you have rights to criticize Pelosi or hanoi Jane , etc.
What did Trig Palin do to deserve the treatment he 's gotten ?
Oh , yeah -- he 's a Palin .
Did I say anything about Trig ?
Poor thing has Sarah for a mom he needs all the breaks he can get .
Spin and dance till you are dizzy though .
I never ONCE said that there was no sexism .
There is sexism , racism , homophobia , etc. @..
all in politics .
What I said was is that the candidates were not treated any differently by the media ( and that includes pundits ) based on whether they were conservative or liberal .
I do n't care what you "@ say @" is supposedly true .
I have read articles written by women who experienced the bias first hand , and later talked about it openly via the media curcuit ( see Geraldine Ferraro and Hillary Clinton ) .
I will take their word for it thanks .
There is no bias .
WOMEN are subject to sexism in politics @...
it is not unique to one party or the other .
Minorities are subject to bigotry in politics @...
no party bias needed .
What do n't you get ?
That you are telling me Laura Bush was treated the same as Michelle Obama ?
ROFL !
Do n't come in here spouting there is no sexist bias in the liberal media , then refuse to back up your claims and expect to be taken seriously .
It do n't wash .
Neither does deflection .
I will give you one example of different treatment .
Watch the Chris Matthews show when he has a Liberal guest .
It is all fun , smiles , agreement and a few softball questions .
Then watch him interview a Conservative guest and get back to me .
That is the case on almost every show all day long on MSNBC . I call it the AOATT network since it is All Obama All The Time .
And pundits on Fox are different how exactly ?
Have you watched a Hannity "@ interview @" ( gush , gush ) @...
EXCUSE ME AGAIN !
But while everyone is donning sackclothe and ashes over some supposed slurs thrown toward Amy and Chelsea ( for which I have yet to see a scintilla of evidence . )
Does anyone remember how Juanita Broaderick was treated ?
Lewinsky ?
Paula Jones ?
It was like I was back in high school .
The SAME SEXIST DOUBLE STANDARD that feminists supposedly were fighting against WAS ENSHRINED IN PUBLIC POLICY AND THEY TOOK IT DOWN IT EVEN ATTACKING FIVE YEAR OLDS !
Bill Clinton was some "@ victim @" of his hormones .
"@ I mean he could n't help himself .
After all he 's a guy ! @"
Poor wittle Bill Clinton .
And the women were "@ nuts and sluts ! @"
The guy is a hero and a victim , the girl is a gutter slut !
And the same feminists who were going after sexual harassment after the Anita Hill debacle failed to take down Clarence Thomas , took their rage on the road and started attacking five years olds with "@ sexual harassment . @"
But the same people who went after five year olds for "@ kissing a girls buttons , @" suddenly turned a blind eye when it came to Old Billy Boy !
Bubba was a victim and feminists went so far as to write they would get on their hands and knees and give Bubba a Lewinsky as long as he kept abortion legal .
ANYONE REMEMBER THAT ?
I SURE AS HELL DO !
And anyone want to remember how the BUSH TWINS WERE TREATED .
Comedy Central was even doing "@ That 's my Bush @" with the Bush Twins as incestuous lesbians .
And you libs claim oppression over Chelsea and Amy ?
HAR DE HAR HAR !
What selective memories you all have !
Notice how liberals will n't address the different treatment the women against Clinton got ?
Provide examples of how they have n't been .
I have a personal bug about any guy who thinks it 's relevant to comment about a woman 's "@ fuck @-@ ability @" @...
I have news for you @....
most of these women would n't fuck you if their very lives depended on it .
Aw , come on , now @.....
we 're talkin @' " conservative " -@ women , here .
That shouldn ' t include marriage ?????
You state the candidates were not treated differently @...
then when showed you are wrong @...
can n't even back up your BS with anything other than your useless bluster .
This ai n't hard .
Why ?
you will n't .
Who 's an idiot ?
Oh yeah , women that make themselves completely dependent on men .
And the americans who support Sharia Law , considering in Islam Sharia Law puts women as subservient to men .
I have no problem with folks that want to voluntarily put themselves in such a position , anymore than I do with folks that want to live by Canon Law or any other religious dictates that do n't interfere with secular law .
As with all religions , in America , you can quit and the State will not punish you nor allow anyone else to bring you to harm over it , though the community may shun you .
That 's why we have New York , LA and SF . The only punishment a religious community can exert is expulsion .
Oh well .
The problem is the women in those countries do n't have a choice .
The muslims who support sharia law are anti @-@ woman , anti @-@ gay , racist bigots .
It sucks that the muslim moderates in this country and other countries do n't speak out against those in their religion who still think backwards like this .
I find it hypocritical when many of the liberal minded people on this board support sharia law and that sect of the muslim faith , it bothers me to be honest .
This is the "@ definition @" of a liar to a liberal .
Anyone that tells them the truth and they know they can n't refute it .
Notice he can n't PROVE I 'm a liar .
i was calling Soggy a liar , Once again proving you are a fucking moron .
Not everything is about you twat
Now there is a nice "@ non sexist @" term .
Glad you could stop by the misogyny thread and drop that little bomb for us all to witness .
I have a theory .
Misogynist Lefties use the words "@ twat @" and "@ cunt @" as insults because they feel sexually inferior and are actually afraid of Real Women ( and they have Mommy Issues ) .
Anti women , anti gay , racist bigots ?
You just described the Republican Party !
Conservative women are like skin @-@ head Jews .
I hold the same opinion of both .
A skin headed Jew ???????????
I did n't know there were Jewish Neo @-@ Nazis .
News to me !

Thank goodness for the internet then , since the news is there for you .

The must explain why I come here to have my IQ lowered just by reading things like the stuff written by you !
Well , obviously you are n't a conservative female in this mode
27 years old ; wife , homemaker , mother of three ; has never worked a day in her life in a "@ business @" .
I 'm not even sure that she 's ever voted .
Her wedding vows included the words @.....
"@ With this ring I thee wed . With this body I thee worship .
With all my wordly possessions I thee endow . @"
or of the quiverfull variety or you would n't be neglecting your domestic duties prattling on about men 's business , like politics and worldly affairs .
Do you leave yourself in a state of complete dependence on men for anything outside of the household ?
If not , you are not a true conservative woman .
You have some feminazi equality mumbo jumbo in your poke .
You 're an idiot and can n't read .
I already addressed this .
So this is twice you get your ass kicked by a conservative woman !
While I agree with the premise of your comments ; that Conservative women are definitely a group that it is acceptable to attack in our society ; your analogy has a major hole in it @.....
Sarah Palin is about as Conservative as Josef Stalin .
Conservative women are individuals like my sister-in-law @....
THAT is a Conservative woman .
Not some half @-@ baked , ego inflated PTA mother who can n't even keep her own home in order , nevermind actually carry through on the term of her elected office .
EXCUSE THE BLEEDING HELL OUT OF ME ??????????????
Are you telling me that ONLY WOMEN WHO STAY HOME AND BAKE COOKIES ARE CONSERVATIVE ????????????
ARE YOU REALLY SAYING THAT WITH A STRAIGHT FACE ?
Dude , I 'm a stay a home mother now , but I WORKED PLENTY in my young married years .
I worked full time , took care of a baby , and a house .
I had to , we could n't afford for me to stay at home at the time .
THERE IS NOTHING in your wedding vows that says a woman can n't work and there is even a Proverb about how the good wife works .
She works both IN and OUT of the home .
Right now , I 'm planning to go back to work since I have one kid who is now an adult , and the other is practically in high school ( one more year and she will be ) .
There is nothing in my wedding vows that says otherwise and I have my husband completely behind the idea ( hell , we can use the dough ) .
Is anyone going to even TRY to say I 'm not conservative ????????
You just do n't know what you are talking about .
Proverbs 31 @:@ 10 @-@ 31 ( King James Version )
10 Who can find a virtuous woman ?
for her price is far above rubies .
11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her , so that he shall have no need of spoil .
12 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life .
13 She seeketh wool , and flax , and worketh willingly with her hands .
14 She is like the merchants @' ships ; she bringeth her food from afar .
15 She riseth also while it is yet night , and giveth meat to her household , and a portion to her maidens .
16 She considereth a field , and buyeth it @: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard .
17 She girdeth her loins with strength , and strengtheneth her arms .
18 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good @: her candle goeth not out by night .
19 She layeth her hands to the spindle , and her hands hold the distaff .
20 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor ; yea , she reacheth forth her hands to the needy .
21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household @: for all her household are clothed with scarlet .
22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry ; her clothing is silk and purple .
23 Her husband is known in the gates , when he sitteth among the elders of the land .
24 She maketh fine linen , and selleth it ; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant .
25 Strength and honour are her clothing ; and she shall rejoice in time to come .
26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom ; and in her tongue is the law of kindness .
27 She looketh well to the ways of her household , and eateth not the bread of idleness .
28 Her children arise up , and call her blessed ; her husband also , and he praiseth her .
29 Many daughters have done virtuously , but thou excellest them all .
30 Favour is deceitful , and beauty is vain @: but a woman that feareth the LORD , she shall be praised .
31 Give her of the fruit of her hands ; and let her own works praise her in the gates .
I thought Bill Clinton treated women with the uppermost respect .
IF you have proof to otherwise show , I would like to see it .
Bwahahahaaa !!!!!
Eight words !
"@ You ought to put some ice on that ! @"
As I suspected , you have no proof otherwise , because there is no proof , only accusations .
Bill Clinton Cheated on his wife .
You do n't cheat on your wife if you respect women , yourself , or your marriage .
What does a liberal do when anyone brings up Bill Clinton .
BRING BACK THE "@ NUTS AND SLUTS @" DEFENSE !
Thank you for making my argument .

So far , I 'm not really feeling that ass kicking .
And as a liberal and a feminist , I support your decision to be a stay at home woman .
And if your husband should die or empty out your accounts and take off with a floozy , I would still support your decision by supporting programs that would allow you to stay at home with your children instead of placing them in daycare and working to support them financially .
Yet I do n't think you support those same programs , which is what makes conservatism anti @-@ woman .
Dumbass , these "@ Jews @" were people who immigrated to Israel and caused problems for them .
They were not "@ Jews . @"
Try reading comprehension .
Man , this is a damn stupid thread .
The media made fun of Sarah Palin because she 's stupid .
Not because she 's Conservative .
There are many , many conservative women that have in fact been given all kinds of undeserved praise by the right @-@ wing specifically because they are conservative .
Many people hate these women , but not any more or less than many people hate women on the liberal side of the fence .
Women like Nancy Pelosi , or Hillary Clinton , or Rachel Maddow .
In fact , I have seen extremely hateful comments about all these women on these very pages .
In fact , I 'd be willing to wager that with a little searching , I could find comments such as these made by the OP .
Bwahahahaaa !!!!!
That depends on whether they agree to outside affairs , so once again , you have no proof and loving dozens of women does not mean you do n't respect every one of them .
Ever get anything of substance , do tell .
It was long ago .
Maybe it was a sigline picture .
But YOU got busted for it .
And now you 're here feigning outrage at the same sort of thing .
Show an iota of integrity for once in your drab wretched oxygen wasting life .
YOU ARE AN ABSOLUTE LIAR !
SHOW AN IOTA OF HONESTY AND PRODUCE THE EVIDENCE .
You 're even changing now where the picture was .
First it 's the avatar and now it 's in the sigline ?
You just made that up to change the subject because you knew the liberals were losing in this thread ( as usual ) and you had to change the subject .
AND YOU TALKING ABOUT HONESTY AND INTEGRITY is like Bill Clinton lecturing others against lying and adultery .
Losing the thread ?
I 've got you now defending calling women Nazis .
How do feel about calling Cindy Sheehan a prostitute ?
Calling her a media whore ?
Do you think that 's about the same as what Schultz said ?
You are the biggest laughable liar .
Show me where I called a woman a nazi ?
YOU BROUGHT UP THE SUBJECT OF NAZIS .
I simply addressed it !
Now you act like I brought it up ?
First you go FROM TELLING THE THE PREPOSTEROUS LIE that I put Hillary Clinton in cross hairs .
A COMPLETE LIE .
Now you are going to the hysterical liberal tacitc of the third degree .
Asking question after question THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME , as IF I have to justify myself to YOU !
( what a joke ! )
You are a laughable loon .
I am supposed to answer a bunch of laughable accusations when you have n't even produced the evidence FOR THE FIRST LAUGHABLE ACCUSATION ???????
Where is the evidence I ever put Hillary in crosshairs ?
Still waiting , you laughable partisan hack !
If they were n't Jews , what were they ?
Muslims , Christians , Hindi , Atheist ?
Just because they are Russian immigrants does n't mean they are n't Jews .
Where does it state they are n't Jews ?
And sorry , working outside of the home especially after having children and not being a member of the slum classes is an explicitly liberal philosophy .
Are you sure you are a conservative ?
YOU DO N'T FOLLOW LINKS AND READ !
Ok , and this <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=81429"> Arutz Sheva article </a> indicates that he was n't a Jew .
But what about the other neo @-@ Nazis ?
A non @-@ Jewish IDF soldier who immigrated to Israel from Russia was arrested Wednesday and found to belong to a neo @-@ Nazi organization .
During the subsequent police investigation , suspicions arose that the two may have immigrated to Israel using counterfeit documents .
However , due to the complex nature of Israel 's Law of Return , it is possible that they arrived legitimately .
The law , modeled in response to the Nazi Nuremberg Laws , gives anyone with even one Jewish grandparent the right to receive automatic Israeli citizenship .
The Interior Ministry said it was checking into the matter and will consider revoking the citizenship of the two if they indeed used fraudulent documents , but warned that such action is complicated from a legal perspective .
More on it here @:
What it boils down to is these people immigrated to Israel FOR THE PRECISE reason of causing trouble .
Not everyone that lives is Israel is a Jew , and as the article notes "@ right of return @" means if you have even the slightest heritage , you have the right of return .
Under those auspices HITLER could have immigrated since his grandmother was reputedly a Jew .
Your BS article falls flat .
Do n't trust Reuters as a main source for your information .
Obviously , you can n't read for comprehension .
The links I have posted have nothing to do with the soldier , Dmitri Bogotich , who was being investigated for heroin with the neo @-@ nazi link being overseas and the assailants in my link , Eli Buanitov , part of a group that was discovered in the course of investigations of swastikas and graffiti coupled with assaults in whose very words illuminate the self @-@ hatred , "@ My grandfather is half Yid , so that this piece of trash will n't have ancestors with even the smallest percent of Jewish blood . @"
The fact that there are multiple stories with different players kind of refutes the ridiculousness of such a statement , eh ?
As an aside , exactly what publications do you believe to be "@ uncompromised @" ?
If Reuters , Der Spiegel , Haaretz are n't acceptable ?
Nice try BUT THIS IS ABOUT THE "@ NEO @-@ NAZIS @" case in Israel .
Try again !
Because "@ feminazi @" WAS part of the criticism and ridicule of the National Organization of Women .
Sluts was used to CHANGE THE SUBJECT and ATTACK ANYONE ACCUSING HORNDOG CLINTON .
Feminazi was not used to change the subject and suggest any woman at NOW for abortion or bringing sexual harassment cases against school children was a nymphomaniac .
The "@ Nuts and Sluts @" defense was USED PRECISELY to get the heat off Bill "@ could n't keep it in his pants @" Clinton and make the victims of this horndog seem to be the "@ guilty party . @"
So comparing women to Nazis is acceptable if it 's on topic ??
Are you telling me that ONLY men were Nazis ?
In other words , NYcarbineer , you keep repeating the same gibberish .
You repeated it again .
That 's what teapartysamurai is showing you .
The term feminazi is directed at the adherents of feminism , an ideology that is ultimately premised on Marxism .
It 's not now and never was a derogatory term for women .
It applies to male adherents of feminism too , you know , limp @-@ wristed , leftist men .
Now do you intend to go on pretending that the term applies to gender and not ideology ?
I can see that it ai n't wise to mess with teapartysamurai ; she wields a punishing categorical logic and a wicked right punch line .
But it 's all flying right over your head .
Sara Palin is Conservative ?
Really ?
Really ?
Conservatives have obviously been redefined , as everything else seems to have become .
Recent stats show approximately 50 % of women aged 15 @-@ 44 have at least one unplanned pregnancy in their lives .
So the Republican Party wants to force half the women in America to have an unwanted child .

So the answer is to KILL THAT MANY CHILDREN ???????????
I had an "@ unplanned @" pregnancy .
My hubby and I wanted to wait until he finished college before having kids .
Did n't work out .
We were the adults .
We made the kid .
We were n't going to make the kid pay for our "@ unplanned @" pregnancy .
We did what we had to so the kid could be born and supported .

Sure as hell worked for me !
Liberals !
There is no such thing as being responsible or taking responsibility for one 's actions .
Nope !
Their answer is drag a kid out with a vacuum and cut it in pieces while it 's still alive !
LIBERALS !
DISGUSTING IRRESPONSIBLE VERMIN !
great you made a personal choice that worked for you .
That personal choice does n't go beyond the players in that situation .
But then again i am quoting a social conservative hypocrite
I would LOVE to hear how you figure I 'm a hypocrite .
This is gonna be good !
Notice liberals keep throwing accusations my way WITH NO EVIDENCE ??
That 's the definition of a liberal that 's LOSING THE ARGUMENT .
They want to desperately put you on the defensive , and they hope something will stick and put you on the defensive .
It 's so obvious !
As for "@ that choice does n't be beyond the players . @"
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN ?
That abortion goes beyond "@ personal choice @" because the Democrat party is so invested in it ?
What does that mean ?
This rationalization , I have just GOT to hear !
I 'm sharpening my claws now .
Be my guest !
My memory is good enough to recall the time you got in trouble over on hannity for putting up an avatar that was a picture of Hillary Clinton ,

Okay , YOU are full of it and a liar !
My Avatar was Sarah Palin holding a gun , Remember ?????????
You let me know when you have evidence otherwise .
This is why you got banned from Hannity .
This crap .
You are the biggest paid liar on the internet .
On top of that , how would that be misogyny , even if I did do it , which I did n't , I 'M A WOMAN YOU MORON !
Come on teapartylady .
FESS UP !!!
your not helping the OP 's case .
Oh , like you 're the one to judge ?
Like YOU help your side calling me a twat ???????
Real progressive there , Plasma !
im not a progressive twat .
My stances on issues tend to run case by case , and trust me , i am vastly more conservative that you ever will be .
If I had a dime for every liberal who claimed to be "@ more conservative than I am @" I 'd swear I 'd buy Hannity 's website !
Are you still posting over there ?
Now we have three sock puppets .
This is why liberals are double and tripling down on Palin .
Same reason .
They are terrified of a conservative women who can kick their asses .
They do n't know what to do .
When they stop even discussing the issue in the op and just start making baseless accusations and insults , you know you have won the debate .
But then I knew that several hours ago .
Yeah , and I 'm posting under the nick of DaGooseman .
The next time you are on Hannity , just flame the heck out DaGooseman and tell everyone you know it 's me .
It 's cool , I will n't mind @......
I am praying for the Palin / Bachman ticket .
Please God , let it happen @...

Debate anyone ?
I 'M A WOMAN , YOU IDIOT !
Just because you can n't look at an attractive women without objectifying her , DO N'T INCLUDE ME !
The picture is supposed to be of of fearless samurai .
You can n't look at it without drooling , that 's SAYS MORE ABOUT YOU !
Thanks for letting us know that !
As we can see from this thread , you are an imbecile who can not back none of your lies up .
Being a women shows you disrepect your own gender by displaying them in soft porn .
And that says a lot about yourself , not about me .
LMAO !
How easily she gets confused .
I think we see the imbecile .
As for "@ lies . @"
When you have evidence of my "@ lies , @" let me know .
PUT UP OR SHUT UP .
The evidence is your inability to prove your lies by backing them up .
It is you who needs to PUT UP OR SHUT UP UP .
Just because I slamdunk you braindead liberals back to the stone age does n't constitute a "@ lie . @"
You have failed on every lying accusation , Loser .
It just means you can n't come up with anything else to refute my argument but the usual liberal baseless accusation .
It just means you are a liar who can not prove her point , and lost this thread by being an imbecile .
As for your charges of soft porn .
I think that says far more about how YOU view STRONG WOMEN , than anything else .
Attempting to hide your disrepect for women is laughable at best , and fully ignorant of how women want to be protrayed .
Sorry , but you tried the typical sexism card you libs pull out to attack MEN and it backfired because I 'm a woman .
Nothing backfired liar .
You are still a liar who can not back up your accusations , and an imbecile so stupid she does n't realize she lost this thread .
In other words , you are lying loser .
LMAO !!!
But , as usual , with liberals , when something backfires , they never are intelligent enough to admit they goofed .
They just double down on the same stupidity and leave no doubt with anbody how without original thought or intelligence they are .
That sounds like you Loser , unable to prove even one point with your dishonesty and lies .
IN OTHER WORDS .
I because I beat you and your mind can n't accept that happened , "@ I must be lying . @"
The sad part is , I bet you think that really works .
NOTICE AGAIN , PEOPLE !
When liberals cease to even DISCUSS THE OP and just MAKE BASELESS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST YOU .
They are admitting they have lost .
That liberals think only a man can win the election ?
As we can see , the ignorant imbecile does n't even know when she is lying .
That makes her a habitual liar .
PUT UP YOUR SUPPORTING EVIDENCE OR SHUT UP LOSER !!
it means the choice does n't go beyond you , your husband ( or man you are with ) and your doctor .
Nobodies else 's opinion matter .
I do n't care what the Dem party has invested in abortion .
The Choice is not yours to make unless it concerns you .
My life does and never will concern you .
If my wife and i decided we did n't want the child at this moment and went the abortion route , it is our choice .
I do n't need to ask your permission , nor hear your opinion on it .
If you felt you needed to state or stop us , i would not be above just decking you .
Stay out of other people 's personal affairs .
I do n't give a shit if you get hit by a bus tomorrow , your life is meaningless to me , and if you choose to keep or abort a child has no impact on me whatsoever .
This is MY opinion and stance , Not a progressive , not a liberal , nor a democrat policy .
They do not speak for me , just like you will never choose what i can and can not do with my body .
How are you a hypocrite ?
Answer these for me .
Are you against government removing transfats ?
Smoking bans ?
and other nannystate type situations ?
See someone like you is for making a law banning all Abortions .
You want to use government to limit peoples rights and freedoms .
You will say its for the children blah blah , but the reality is you want your morals imposed on others .
Oh , this is going to be EASY !
I can destroy you by pointing out one little fact .
IT WAS LIBERALS THAT MADE A FEDERAL LAW "@ BANNING . @"
Not social conservatives .
You see before Roe v. Wade , each state had their own laws on abortion IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 10 TH AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION .
It was not until Roe v. Wade when the "@ Jane Roe @" ( who later admitted she lied about being raped ) went to the USSC and the USSC VIOLATED THE 10 TH AMENDMENT making a federal law from the bench .
Thus , liberals BANNED THE RIGHT OF THE STATES TO DECIDE ON THIS QUESTION , which is their legal right per the 10 th Amendment .
Over turning the Unconstitutional , Roe v. Wade bans nothing .
It simply RETURNS THE QUESTION TO THE STATES , where it resided before 1973 .
Thus , your argument about my "@ hypocrisy @" falls flat because it 's built on your OWN IGNORANCE regarding the Constitution and the origins of Roe v. Wade .
That also collapses your "@ it does n't go beyond you or your husband . @"
No , sorry .
The question goes TO THE STATES as noted in the 10 th Amendment .
You want to try again , and make it even more obvious how badly you just lost on that issue ?
you seriously have to be one of the most stupidest fucks ever to walk this earth .
This was n't a state right issue you fucking waste of air .
this was about your personal belief that YOU would create a law banning Abortion .
Liberals did n't ban abortion you motherfucking twat , which is what we are talking about .
Not your pathetic attempt to move to goal posts like you always fucking do in your attempt to debate people .
This is why nobody ever talks to you .
You just move your argument around in circles never actually landing on a point .
if i could time travel i would go back in time and pay your parents not to have you , and thus saving the world of your stupidity .
OMG @....
the motherfucking irony .
What an idiot .
Did n't you earlier say this debate was n't about me ?
Now you want to make it about YOU ?
ill take this as a no .
I figured you would pussy out .
Pussy out !!! ???
that 's misogynist !!!!!!!
You should say she would '@ out in a gender non @-@ specific genital way @'
she tucked tail and hightailed it out of here due to being a dumbass
and what do you want liar ?
I would think Fox News would punish anyone who said anything of the sort .
They are #1 and I 'm sure they would want to stay there .
I do n't know anything about Rush Limbaugh .
Strange then that Glenn Beck called Senator Mary Landrieu a "@ Prostitute @" and a "@ Whore @" , because she did n't vote the way he wanted her to , yet he was never punished for it .
Cindy Sheehan is a tragedy slut .

Link where you got that quote ????????
What do you bet , that 's not forthcoming !
Conservative women do n't understand the glass houses analogy
And Misogynist Leftwingers do n't understand the concept of a Double Standard .
How many male candidates have been attacked with accusations that their children were not their own ?
Have you missed the last 200 years of the American political scene ?
A candidates sexual adventures have always been fair game
BWAHAHAHAA !
The burden of proof is on me ?
I DID N'T MAKE A CLAIM ON WHAT IS IN THE CONSTITUTION !
Nice damn try you dumbasses !
Carbiner claimed the USSC found in the Constitution that a 1 st Trimester Fetus has no rights .
WHERE IS THAT IN THE CONSTITUTION ????????
I 'm still waiting !
The burden of proof is on you .
YOU make the claim that 1 st Trimester Fetuses have no rights and the burden of proof is on me ????
That 's as stupid as when Dan Rather got caught with those fake National Guard records and claimed his accusers had to prove they were fake .
The sad part is , I bet you think that works !
You asked someone to prove a negative .
You need to re @- take Debating 101 .
[quote=teapartysamurai;3700200]
Yes .
Right after you tell me whether or not it 's acceptable to use that sort of , as the OP calls it , MISOGYNISTIC rhetoric against Sheehan .
You claim it 's wrong for Schultz to talk that way about Ingraham .
Is it wrong for __________ to talk that way about Sheehan ?
Oh NICE TRY !
In other words you will provide proof , AFTER I accept a premise NOT IN EVIDENCE ???????
Did you think that was going to work ????????
I must accept your laughable premise WITHOUT PROOF , before you will provide proof ?
This is why you got banned from Hannity !

Greetings .
It 's great to have you with us .
It 's Thanksgiving week and the first wave of the Limbaugh clan begin arriving this afternoon .
I always look forward to this week .
I look forward to this time of year , every year .
It 's one of my favorite times of year .
Hello , folks .
800 @-@ 282 @-@ 2882 if you want to be on the program .
The e-mail address , <a href="mailto:ElRushbo@eibnet.com"> ElRushbo@eibnet.com </a> .
Let me ask you a question .
How many votes did Roland Burris get for his Senate seat ?
How many votes did the Democrat Senator from Colorado get for his seat ?
Zero .
They were both appointed .
The Senator from Colorado , Michael Bennet , said over the weekend he would gladly lose his seat to pass health care .
I told you people this .
I told you the Democrats are going to thin the herd .
They are gladly willing to lose members .
Everybody 's talking about this , "@ Oh , no , it 's a horrible thing that happened on Saturday . @"
Folks , it was a fait accompli .
Nobody was going to vote to not do a debate .
I mean , even Lieberman voted for this , and he 's not going to vote for the final bill .
Now , when you hear a Democrat go on television and solemnly pronounce , as Senator Ben Nelson did @: "@ No health care if no change in public option and abortion funding , @" or Mary Landrieu , "@ I will not vote for this as it is written , @" they are not espousing core beliefs .
They are simply opening bids .
They are simply making opening bids to Harry Reid .
Mary Landrieu has now shown that she can get paid off ; other people are going to have their price .
So when they come along and say , "@ I 'm not going to sign this thing as it 's written .
Why , I 'm not going to put my signature on this !
I will n't vote for it if there 's a public option in there .
I 'm not going to vote for this if there 's abortion funding , @" that 's just BS . That 's a signal to Harry Reid .
That 's just their opening bid @: "@ What will you give me to vote for this thing ?
How much will you give me to change my mind ? @"
Who will write the escape statement @: "@ I voted against it before I voted for it . @"
This is classic what 's going on here , and it 's right out in the open for everybody to see .
Let 's see , who voted for this ?
Robert Byrd from a stretcher practically ; Tim Johnson , who we 're never even allowed to hear talk because he has n't recovered from his stroke ; that stooge senator who replaced Ted Kennedy .
How many votes did he get ?
The Senator who replaced Ted Stevens , Al Franken ; and that moral paragon , of course , Roland W. Burris ; and Michael Bennet from Colorado .
That 's the Democrat who was appointed to replace Ken Salazar .
A lot of no @-@ votes guys and here they are voting on something like this and here they 're going to be voting on it again when and if that vote ever takes place .

That 's your problem with depending on liberal webistes that take out of context or edit .
Problem is , I 'm a 24/7 member and have access TO THE ENTIRE QUOTE .
It 's pretty obvious Rush is SAYING the WHOLE DAMN PARTY MALE AND FEMALE are prostituting themselves for their vote on healthcare .
Like Blago was any different trying to sell Obama 's seat ?
Nice try !
you want to compare Ideology then ?
I am willing to take the bet .
Oh , another sexist term .
Thank you for once again reminding us how "@ progressive @" liberals are !
How exactly does that context change the meaning of the quote ?
Did Rush Limbaugh actually specifically call anyone else involved a "@ whore @" or a "@ prostitute @" ?
No , he did n't , just her .
And Schultz was also using the term slut in the context of her being a prostitute for the right @-@ wing , not in terms of her sexual mores .
Therefore he was saying the exact same thing that Schultz was , he just used the term "@ prostitute @" instead of "@ Slut @" , which is equally misogynist .
Well Damn !
Do n't take away their right to call women twats , cunts , whores , sluts and to trash their bodies and looks .
That would be almost like castrating the poor assholes .
After three yeas of Obama , massive increases in unemployment insurance payments , increases in welfare recipients , and Obamacare , you 're gonna go there ?
Wow .
Obama has n't had a Democratic Congress for 3 years .
And ironically , all of Obama 's failures have been because he contined Republican policies .
0 bama signed the bills of "@ Unpaid for expansion of entitlements @" , did he not ?

The truth is , now that Ohio went to Mitt the race is all but over .
The problem is that all of the candidates are flailing around like a chicken with their head cut off .
Too stupid to know they 're dead , but determined anyways to do as much damage as they can on the way out .
IF IF IF the nomination process ended tomorrow , Mitt might stand a fairly good shot at beating Obama .
But the longer this goes on , the worse his odds get .
You think you could polish obama 's ass with your pompoms any harder while you lick his boots ?
There is NO WAY IN HELL the kenyan will win reelection , no matter WHAT happens during the republican primaries .
obama will lose in a land slide .
Eh .
I do n't think he deserves to win .
I 'm planning on voting for Mitt in the General .
The problem is that everyone is so concerned with winning the nomination , they 're poisoning the well in the general .
When you have a vicious hard fought primary in battleground states like Ohio and Florida , you have a lot of work to do to win back your own divided base and the Moderates who just watched you sling mud with sickening precision .
Now , if the nomination process ended soon , Mitt could start repairing the damage he 's done to himself in this process .
But the race keeps going , keeps traveling to battleground states where he keeps damaging himself just to win .
The general is n't a lock for Obama , but if you 're thinking it 'll be an easy win for the GOP you 're quite frankly insane .
Obama is going to fight hard , his proxies are going to fight hard , and right now the GOP Nomination process is doing their work for free .
The longer this goes on , the more likely an Obama victory will be .
I totally disagree with your thoughts on all levels .
I do n't believe any damage at all is being done the republican candidates .
I think this election cycle is making them tough and ready , and nothing I 've seen or heard is making me dislike any one of them .
I 'll back which ever one wins .
The only people that are parroting this "@ the republicans are hurting themselves @" bull shit is the LIBERALS , so I think you 're either gullible or here spreading crap .
You 're free to have your own opinion on it .
One thing you can n't deny is that this process is flat out wasting money that should be spent in the General .
Citizens means that Obama is going to have huge cash store in play and a pretty effective group of proxies .
Deny the damage done by the negative ads in the battleground states if you want , but even if none of that sticks come the General , the money spent is gone .
Wasted targeting the other GOP candidates , and not Obama .
If Mitt wants to win , he desperately needs to get back on to attacking Obama and off of going after Santorum .
But that is n't likely to happen as no one is dropping out .
Did you type that with a straight face ?
He is the very embodiment of the social Darwinism of the right .
He personifies the "@ greed is good @" catechism that was put on steroids during Reagan 's time in office , and is the very TRUEST standard bearer of Reagan 's legacy .
Granted , he has a habit of being a bit more abrupt , or forthright about his "@ screw them @" attitude , as his disconnect from ordinary Americans is way more loud and proud than it was back in the day , but the overall intent is totally on target .
You all can rest assured that you , too will be fucked over in a Romney administration the same way Reagan fucked you or your parents .
By '@ greed is good @' , I take it you mean he 's a successful , self made multi @-@ millionaire with a great head for business @....
Yea , God forbid we elect one of those to run this country @...
much better to elect idiot after idiot .
Yes , someone who DID work their way up from humble beginnings to become a big success WOULD be a good candidate for President .
How much money did Romney 's dad leave him in his inheritance ?
How much money did Obama 's dad leave him in HIS inheritance .
Funny how you equate success with being born rich and staying that way .
Only CONZ could think that being born on third means they hit a triple .
Envy is n't a virtue Deceptious .
Romney is not conservative .
He is Republican , through and through , which makes him much closer to Bush and Obama than to being a conservative .
He is neither fiscally nor socially conservative despite the rhetoric he is employing to get him the nomination and a shot at the Presidency .
Unfortunately , there is too much of this "@ Anybody but @...@ @"
mentality .
If only we had someone that cared about this nation , liberal or conservative , who would run .
If we did , we might actually survive as a nation .
It is not the philosoply that is our problem .
It is the person behind the philosophy .
Immie
itll take a true 3 rd party nominee ( i.e. Ross Perot ) to truly change the conversation .
Unfortunately that also takes money and backing from the rich and powerful .
Right now , they are doing very well with the two parties they have .
They are not going to cut their noses off to spite their faces .
Work ?
Well @...
yeah , I guess you could say he worked it .
Is not relying on Family , friends , and charities an abdication of personal responsibility as well ?
You tell me .
No , that is what they are there for .
Paul is more interested in his "@ states rights @" issue even after a "@ national @" disaster .
How is it a "@ national @" disaster ?
If only one state was hit yet as much damage and death took place , would it no longer be a "@ national disaster @" in your eyes ?
Do you know what a republic is ?
Do you have any idea why we are referred to as the "@ Unites States @" ?
Oh , so now it must have the official "@ National @" disaster label before yo uare Ok with our Federal government helping out your fellow citizens ?
REALLY ?
Wow @...
Do n't be a dick @.....
I simply asked why it was labelled as a national disater .
I do n't see how anything you 've posted disproves what I said .
He 's talking about private citizens .
Are you saying private citizens are not the purview of the US Gov't ???
I 'm saying that it 's not the U.S. government 's responsibility to give money to those hit by natural disasters .
Is n't it interesting how Libertarians @' desire for "@ freedom @" correspond so neatly with skinflints who do n't want to give ANYONE , ANYTHING .
So while libertarianism attracts people who want to be "@ free @" it also attracts cheap assholes who do n't want to pay their fair share .
Perhaps when Libertarians figure out a way to differentiate between the two , I 'll vote for them .
What a disingenuous hack you are .
Libertarians / Conservatives give WAAAAY more voluntarily that you do through the force of government .
You cry about "@ paying their fair share @" , all the while ignoring the FACT that we voluntarily GIVE more than you propose to TAKE .
The reason you libs want to forcibly TAKE from others is that you look in the mirror and KNOW that you would n't GIVE of your own free will .
You project YOUR shortcomings on everyone else in order to make yourselves feel better about your own tightwadery .
FUCK YOU !!
One more example of a callous conservative .
Who was it that claimed libealism was a mental disease ?
Oh yeah , Michael Weiner , a conservative radio host whose rants are reflective of the the anger expressed by GuyP .
Im sorry but I agree with him .
The people should have insurance .
RENTAL insurance is cheap like 200 a year or less @..
IF you own a house you should have insurance @..
No excuses @..
I used to rent and had rental insurance .
Please explain to me how rental insurance gets you clothing , water , food , shelter , transportation , etc. right NOW , when these people need it the most ?
Apparently you do n't pay attention to what people post @..
Private charities are down there making sure people get what they need .
As one poster pointed out - restaurants are handing out free food , local stores are supplying free gloves , hard hats , people are going down there to volunteer , people are donating money to fund the effort @..
The federal government is NOT needed - they are NOT the only solution .
When people need help - the help comes from good people - not the ugly federal government .
Besides , we do n't need politicians throwing money at a community while they scratch their bellies then say ; "@ remember me in November - you owe me . @"
Consistent .
It likely will n't .
But I bet not one would go hungry or without a roof if government WAS NOT expected to help out .
Government gets in the way @...
Americans help Americans @....
we always had .
Now ?
Governemnt red tape gets in the way .
REALLY ?
SO , why did we have 131,000 homeless veterans in the 2011 data ?
Are n't our service personnel especially near and dear to the hearts of the right ?
Do you have one living with you yet ?
If not , why not ?
you do n't know me well enough to make that assumption .
I share a mortgage on a home that I have never lived in nor do I collect rent on it .
I have been paying 1400 a month for 8 years for it @...
that incluides real estate taxes .
I have never net the folks that live there @...
I am anaonymous @...
my attorney handles everything .
The foiks that live there are veterans and their families .
Sure @...
you can say "@ it is an investment @" @...
and in a way , it is @.......
for when the time comes , I will sell it off .
But for now , people are enjoying the conmfort of a roof over their head .
FYI @....
there was a lien put on the property because the people did not pay their water bill for 4 years @.....
so I paid it without questioning .
So what do you do for your fellow man ?
Just criticize them for being like you ?
I take care of a Vietnam Veteran .
I call him "@ Dad @" .
As for providing a roof , I applaud you , but until you provide concerted care and have to pay out of pocket for it all , go cry to your "@ attorney @" .
I can n't afford one .
Red cross is there and even the governor said they have more food and clothes then they can handle right now with churches and other groups sending it @..
transportation You should have auto insurance @..
I get what Ron Paul is saying .
Thats what a Hardcore Libertarian would say .
But the rest of us are thinking about the people that do not have insurance and / or need help right now .
Kind of hard to build a house over night , Mr Paul .
Kind of hard to import food considering that the stores are probably wiped out too .
How does one survive until the insurance ( hopefully by a respectable company ) claim comes through ?
How does one survive when you have the funds but the people you need to buy the goods from has no address ?
I know , you get into your pickup and drive over to the next town @-- if you can find your damn pickup !!
Ron Paul is not opposed to private charity .
So nice straw man .
He is opposed to charity from the government .
In the words of the right , a government handout .
The government can n't perform charity .
It 's an impossibility .
The very definition of charity requires voluntariness .
Charity has to be provided of one 's own free will .
The government , by definition , acts through the use of force to take from people .
There is nothing voluntary about it .
Is reading really THIS difficult ?
I have n't seen any libertarian on this board or thread speak out against donating , in fact I 've read the exact opposite .
Is n't it interesting how Libertarians @' desire for "@ freedom @" correspond so neatly with skinflints who do n't want to give ANYONE , ANYTHING @..
Feel free to quote one of us who said nobody wants to give anyone anything .
I have a feeling we 'll be waiting for your reply for quite a while .
He 's just a kid , there 's no point in trying to reason with him .
There is no reason children and teens can n't understand such concepts .
They will never become adults until they are treated to the same standards .
I do n't see how it is government charity when the government FORCES the tax payer to give it up .
Of course you do n't .
because it 's not .
That is not self responsibility @...
That is telling victims @.....
Fuck you
Sorry , but my country is not like that
No looking to the federal government to provide a solution is telling people "@ fuck you . @"
If you really cared you would do more than just pay your taxes and look to your government for a solution every time disaster strikes .
I bet it 's pretty easy to sit on your ass and point to the government @..
I would call that arrogant and snug @...
Paying taxes is n't good enough @....
Not to mention the majority of those assholes who sit there snug , who point to the government for solutions do n't pay taxes anyways @..
Once again liberalism IS a mental disorder @...
Here is the way disaster relief works
If your house burns down , you are responsible for repairs along with whatever insurance and local charities wil pay
If there is a massive fire in your town , you still pay to fix your house , but the state will step in to provide additional assistance along with national charities
In a major disaster affecting a large region , the federal government steps in along with the state to provide disaster relief .
National charities still provide individual assistance while the state and federal government provides grants and low cost loans to allow you to get back on your feet
So explain this @...
if my house is struck by lightening and burns down @....
Why am I not afforded the government grants and low cost loans ?
How does "@ widespread @" affect anyone individually more than "@ one home affected @" ?
You see @...
when you hgave government pick and choose , nothing is done fairly .
When the people pick and choose , everything is done fairly .
So , you agree with Paul , that the government should have left it up to the localities to clean up their mess ?
if the government was not there to help them , I guarantee you , Americans would be there to help .
We , as a collective of individual Americans donated more money to Haiti than all other countries combined .
I am not referring to Government aid that was sent @....
individual donations from individual Americans collectively donted more than all other populations of all other countries combined .
Our government did n't make us do it .
We did it becuase we wanted to .
The problem with the left is they do n't think Americans care about other people , so they feel Government needs to take our money and donate it for us .
They are wrong .
I think that its more they do n't care for other people .
So they do n't expect others to do something they do n't themselves do .
Instead they have calculated that if they look like they care about others , we will give them more power , and sadly we comply .
Exactly , they want to look like they care , however when push comes to shove they start pointing fingers .
I suppose it 's easy to talk but it 's harder to act , and these twats are too fucking lazy and cheap to do a fucking thing .
As the old saying goes "@ talk is cheap . @"
It 's amazing how people do n't see progressives for what they are @...
No I did n't .
I have been talking about disaster relief moving up from local to state to federal .
Each has it 's own role .
FDNY is city government and they were on site since the planes hit .
Federal Government did not have assets or personnel staged in New York and it took them longer to arrive
The Federal Government played a major role in the rebuilding of lower Manattan after 9 @-@ 11 @.......
we could not have relied on private charities
Actually , I questioned you as to why you feel it is OK for the federal government to offer individuals grants and low interest loans when in a wide spread disaster and not offer the same to individuals who suffer similar losses but not in a widespread event . ,
You never answered @...
you went inmto something about the need to clear roads , re build schools , etc. @....
things I DIDNZT question .
But when it came to what I questioned ?
Nada .
So answer my question .
A man who works in a city 30 miles away , loses his ho , e to a tornado that rips uyp the town he lives in . He still has a job becuase the city was unaffected @...
but he lost his home .
Becuase it was widespread , he gets a low interest loan .
In the meantime , a man who works from hoime loses his home to a fire caused by lightening .
Now he not only lost his home , but he lost his place of business .
But it was not widespread , so he does not get federal assiatnce .
Why si that OK with you ?
Why do you hate people that work in their own home ?
Personally @.....
I agree with you and would have no problem with individual homeowners who suffer a catastrophic loss being eligible for low cost loans or tax write @-@ offs .
I believe our right wing and Dr Paul would go ballistic though
As to why we differentiate @...
I did give you a potential rationale
Good question .
It may be a question of magnitude once again .
If your house burns down , you still have your job .
You still have a community structure around you .
What happens when your entire community is wiped out ?
Your job is gone , friends and neighbors who would have helped you before , now have their own problems .
Is a bank going to help you when you do n't even have a job anymore ?
Is a bank going to invest in a community that has been wiped out ?
The government will .
Those loans not only help you rebuild your house but help your boss rebuild his business , help rebuild schools and bridges and roads
Personally , as a citizen , it makes me feel good to know that my government is there to help people in need .
When I see US troops helping OUR people in a disaster area it makes me proud to be an American
In any case , when major disaster strikes , I am happy that the American people are there to help those in need
I love how you progressively can be pushed into conservative or even classical liberal ideas and then the next day you rest yourself like a watch and we do it again @...
It 's almost like you 're a closeted conservative @...
FDNY is local government .
You moved the goal posts from Fed to local .
I do n't believe most progressives even understand the difference between the state and federal government .
Most are too fucking stupid to hold a job - what makes anyone believe they could rationalize the constitution or even the Bill of Rights .
Progressives are like gigantic babies @...
"@ ma , ma @" "@ government , government @"
So one thread was n't enough ?
rdean has to make another one to blatantly lie ?
Im hardly going to be accused of being a Paul fan , but he 's right that the Federal Government has no authority to be involved in disaster aid .
Apparently , rdean thinks that because he will n't help them personally , no one else will .
Beautiful to see States stand up against the intrusion of the Federal Government .
Speaking about the governor of Ohio turning down funds to help people who have lost everything , even family members .
Gee , who said that you swine .
It is beautiful to see States stand up to the intrusion of the Federal government .
It 's not my fault you lack the integrity to acknowledge that there are other ways of providing aid .
Nor my fault that you do n't want to see real charity .
rdean , he said FEDERAL aid , not help in any form .
When you get to know rdean more , you will realize he does n't really care .
Avatar , the fact is there is no intrusion , it was stated that Federal involvement would complicate matters at this point .
It always does .
Read your link and watched the video @..
at no point does Ron Paul say Tornado Victims Should Fend For Themselves ( let them die at work ? )
Another rdean lie .
its a Dean thread @.....
he titles the thread totally different than what the story says @.....
he has a half a dozen of them out now @.....
Dean would be a great News Reporter @.....
they do the same thing @....
spin the story @.....
You can n't be serious .
No relief for disaster victims is one of Paul 's most popular spiels .
Go to Youtube and do a search on "@ Ron Paul against FEMA @" .
You can watch him rail against disaster relief till your heart 's content .
How is it possible for you guys to have so little knowledge about your presidential candidates ?
You seriously scare me .
Dean he admits in the story he bad mouths FEMA @......
so what else you got ? @....
Media of persuasions act in a similar manner .
Yeah , FEMA 's Katrina effort was an epic performance .
Upgrade that unit .
FEMA under Bush was in itself a disaster .
We all know that .
FACT is that FEMA and Homeland Security under Obama works very well .
LOOK IT UP .
Each state can not prepare for a mega disaster .
Having the Federal Government prepared to bring disaster relief where it is needed is more cost effective than 50 states preparing for a disaster that may never come
Look at the massive fires in Arizona and California last years .
Those states can not afford to keep the manpower and equipment on hand to battle thousands of square miles of fire .
The Federal Government is able to bring in personnel and resources from around the country
Why exactly can n't each state be prepared for a mega disaster ?
look at hurricane katrina .
do you think LA alone could have prepared for that ?
lousiana only has 4.5 million people .
Hurricane katrina cost approx $ 110 B in damage .
that means each resident would be responsible for approx $ 25 k worth of the damage .
that is unrealistic
Loisiana is one of our poorest states .
They also get much more federal aid than they pay in taxes If they were expected to be responsible for all the disaster cleanup they would have gone bankrupt .
As it is @......
ALL Americans helped them in their time of need and that is the way it should be
That is n't how it works , dingleberry .
You brought up how well they work under your supreme leader .
Now let 's see some insttances where that is true .
I 'll wait .
And that 's because the State governments have ceded too much power to the Feds .
If we fixed that problem , the States would have significantly more resources and be able to help themselves .
That and they think there is "@ free @" money available , of course they are going to ask .
I think they would be better off without the Feds .
This is part and parcel with you guys .
You are looking to break up the United States .
Ai n't happening any time soon .
Hurricane Irene .
Read all about it .

But Ron Paul wants taxpayers to pay for his airplane trips and then he bills his supporters too @....
Umm @...
no .
lulz .
Having been in direct aid to VT , and Ny myself , the only reason FEMA was even remotely effective is because of class A ground work by the states .
Oh , and the fact they did n't have to actually consult with states they just moved right in thanks to congress giving them broadened authority .
Without local know how , they would have botched the deal just as bad as Katrina .
Hence , they are not really worth having adn should dismantled to the state level .
We have national guard for when the statre requires tactical help such as Irene .
if that 's all FEMA has going for it , it is n't much at all .

Nuts .
My heart goes out to the people in tornado alley and I have no problem with my tax dollars going to help the survivors rebuild their lives .
Classic Ron Paul .
At least in Ron Paul 's world the tornado victims will have legalized drugs and prostitiution to comfort them .
A democrat speaking out against personal liberties , while speaking in favor of spreading the wealth around , not so rare anymore .
There 's neocons who pretend to be conservative but do n't care about budgets and spending , and neolibs like Chris who pretend to be liberal but hate the idea of personal liberties .

Republicans are fucking heartless .
You are such an emotional little twit , derp .
There is NO AUTHORIZATION for the Federal government to do the things you want it to do so you can FEEL GOOD .
Usurping the Constitution every time you turn around is n't good for it ( adherence ) or the People ( dependency )
If you want to me to put it in comparable terms , Democrats are fucking spoiled babies .
I do n't believe your ridiculous proposition has ever been before a court , but if you 're looking for precedent I can help you @...
In 1893 , when a massive drought afflicted Texas farmers , Cleveland categorically refused to grant federal aid to the victims .
He issued an eloquent written justification for his decision @: · Cleveland ’s words skillfully represent the contrast between the effects brought about by the voluntary generosity of private parties and those created through the exercise of the coercive powers of government .
Private individuals , when not hindered by government intervention , have a choice in how to allocate their funds among the various purposes that they deem to be of importance .
Sorry @....
but your argument is a FAIL
Grover Cleveland was acting as chief executive .
The fact that he told flood victims to fuck themselves has no Constitutional bearing
It was a drought , not a flood , and if there was no constitutional authority then , there is no Constitutional authority NOW .
I am afraid there is Constitutional authority to help Americans in times of need .
Again , the General Welfare clause allows Congrees to do what they determine is in the best interests of the General Welfare of the people .
It has been used for a hundred years and upheld by the courts
Libertarians who only look out for themselves may not like it @....
but it is the law of the land
FEMA is an authorized federal agency .
If you disagree with it 's Constitutionality , you are welcome to challenge it in court
What is the policy on federal disaster aid for tornado damage ?
Insurance should cover most losses .
Are we going to cover multi @-@ car fog accidents ?
I had ice storm damage last year .
Where 's my check ?
I do n't see how ron paul is wrong .
Americans have big hearts , and can donate on their own accord .
Also , the state governments have natural disaster plans .
Some of you just love the nanny government @...
The question is why .
Bitching about FEMA during Katrina , then getting on here and posting about how great federal aid is , does n't make perfect sense to you ?
Why not ? ! ? ! ? ! ?? ! ? !
because FEMA would have done quite well with Katrina @....
but Bush was a racist @.....
and he wanted to control the balck population @...
So he intentionally impeded FEMAS success .
Everyone knows that @...
how come you do n't ?
Great point , boy do I feel like a dummy
All the individual changes Obama personally made to FEMA , truly heroic .
The General Welfare clause does n't mean what you think it does , you should read what Madison wrote about it , after all , he wrote the fucking thing .
Seems to me that the great ultra advocates of states rights tried all this once before and they got their asses kicked .
It was a good thing that the president of the UNITED STATES back then was a compasionate man .
Maybe it was to bad he did n't go with , to the victor goes the spoils .
For those who seem to be such strong proponents of the Consitution @...
you sure seem to forget quite a bit of how it reads .
Refresh your memory .
We the People of the United States , in Order to form a more perfect Union , establish Justice , insure domestic Tranquility , provide for the common defence , promote the general Welfare , and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity , do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America .
With all of the posts from the teaparty or rightwingers there is one common thread .
MY money .
Everything else is up for grabs
That 's a lie .
All the gov't cuts we push for , we want you to get the same tax reduction benefits that we get .
I do n't want you to be forced to pay for certain gov't programs i like , which is exactly what you promote and advocate for .
You want me to pay for what you want , I want you to receive the same tax deduction that I get .
What 's the more selfish position there ?
It is more selfish for those who have the means and the power to take more are selfish .
That is the true selfish attitude among this country .
Really , if President Lincoln had taken everything from the south like the rightwingers and neo cons like to think today , it so would have been a different story in this land .
Imagine !
Former black slaves having the ground given to them that those awful slave owners had in their possession .
TO THE VICTOR GOES THE SPOILS !
Generosity is giving more than you can , and pride is taking less than you need .
What am I "@ taking @" by getting to keep more of my own money I earned ?
Selfish is demanding gov't pay for your programs , even when ppl do n't want to .
Generosity is voluntarily giving money on your own free will , robbery is taking money and giving to others against their will .
Seems pretty common sense to me .
I wish there was a way for kooks like you to be tagged so that we could quit protecting you from terrorists and not help you during natural disasters .
When you whine about the US military killing terrorists overseas , we could just single you out here for terrorists to find you while leaving us alone , because "@ you do n't like your tax dollars killing terrorists overseas . @"
Also , we can just tag you and your personal goods for not being supported when a natural disaster hits your trailer .
The Feds will just say , he did n't want us to find him a place to sleep after the tornado sent his trailer airborn .
What 's the difference between wanting you to be taxed more in order to pay someone else 's home insurance costs and wanting you to be taxed more in order to pay for Obamacare ?
If millions have a disastrous medical issue , like cancer , or hundreds or thousands have a natural disaster issue , what 's the difference ?
Should n't your "@ principles @" lead you to support Obamacare ?
If people need help , just assume charity and local gov'ts are n't enough and just tax everyone else to pay for it , what 's the difference ?
But @...

but @...
That 's DIFFERENT !!!
That 's about the answer i expect .
If an ice storm takes down power in a state / city for awhile , causes massive wrecks , etc. then many times Governors ask for Federal help .
Driving on an icy road and wrecking is n't a Federal problem until it affects thousands of people .
A town being leveled is a wee bit more serious than you losing your car in a fog wreck .
You can have 50 cars damaged in a wreck and it still does n't equal the damage of people losing their town / homes / businesses / lives from a tornado going for miles .
Insurance will cover most of the damage but a town being gone causes havoc like loss of normal services to actually live .
The Feds should only help the state and city officials get things stabilized then leave , not hang around like with Katrina giving out money to people .
The ice storm here was very widespread .
No aid .
So the government has a policy or just picking winners and losers ?
Every winter driving on icy roads affects thousands of people .
Try again .

Unlike partisan boobs I do n't discount what 's said simply because of the network , newspaper , or website it was said on .
Lawrence O'Donnell is certainly no fan of Ron Paul , but did his job and debunked a false story .
Kook , insurance companies will rebuild a home , but they can not turn on the electricity , shelter people , keep law and order , when a town has been destroyed .
You are so fucking stupid .
Obamacare is not the same as the Feds propping a city back on its feet .

that would be justice .
Well are n't you just a paragon of class ?
I notice you have nothing to say about your little airplane story being debunked .
IMO we ( Americans ) are all in this together .
As individuals we can not do enough to mitigate the misery of our fellow countrymen when disaster strikes .
This ideology , Libertarianism , seems little different than the ideas expressed by Utopian Socialists more than a century ago .
They are nice in theory , but reality will always get in the way .
Let my tax dollars be used to help other Americans in need , and anyone - business or individuals - who hope to profit from the misery of others are no different than looters and should be treated as such .
Yes , very little different from the Utopian Socialists .
We even think think if our ideas are implemented there will be "@ anti @-@ lions @" that you 'll be able to ride around on .
I did n't realize the CDC was worried about someone passing cancer to someone else sitting on a bus with them .

Hopefully you are sterile .

Enjoy voting for the founding father of Obamacare and still holding a straight face while you tell everyone how conservative you are .
Thanks again , have a great day
If I recall you 're only 26 years old .
I suggest you live a little longer before you broadcast your opinions as anything more than that , or characterize someone like me as a "@ lib @" .
Using "@ lib @" as a pejorative , in effect suggesting all "@ lib @"@ s are the same and hold only far left opinions is abject ignorance .
I 've been on this planet for twice as many years and more than you , and experience counts .
I believe universal preventative health care should be provided to all citizens ; I believe in gun controls ; I believe the war on drugs and the war on poverty have failed ; I believe in fiscal sanity ; I believe in the rule of law and that our Constitution is a living document ; I believe CU v. FEC is the greatest threat to our democratic traditions and to our Republic ; I believe violent criminals need to be incarcerated in prison and if paroled should be supervised for life ; I believe drug offenders need to be punished for their crimes and treated for their addictions ; I believe all citizens between the age of 16 and 32 should should provide two years of service to the nation ; I believe in the rights of states but the rights of all citizens are supreme ; and , I believe that all citizens have a duty to vote and that any effort to place roadblocks to their exercising this franchise as well as anyone who votes fraudulently should be punished upon conviction by incarceration .
See , I can write all of this without attacking you personally or using an emoticon .
You can thank my '@ liberal @' college professors at CAL for this ability .
I can also defend my beliefs in appropriate threads , and would enjoy debates with those who disagree and can do so without the use of emoticons or logical fallacies .
Well I am glad to finally read a few things that you disagree with Obama on .
However , I do n't see how someone can be against the War on Drugs and support fiscal sanity AND support Obama , when his views are the exact opposite on the subject .
Wanting a guy who gets in a bar fight supervised for life seems awfully extreme .
Most of the views you just posted are liberal , so I 'm not sure why me calling you a liberal resulted in this kind of a response .
I consider people , at least in a fiscal sense , liberal if they support big expensive government programs .
Like the ones you listed , and like this one on this thread that GoneBezerk adamantly defends .
40 years of medical practice and sound investments in gold and silver , that 's how .
Idiot .
Paul has not be a practicing Doctor for 40 years .
It 's more like 20 years .
And a good deal of his professional career has been spent in congress .
The 1980 's were 40 years ago ?
I 'm older than I thought .
After earning a Doctor of Medicine degree from Duke University 's School of Medicine in 1961 , and completed his medical internship at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and his residency in obstetrics and gynecology at Magee @-@ Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh .
[ 10 ] Paul served as a flight surgeon in the United States Air Force from 1963 to 1965 and then in the United States Air National Guard from 1965 to 1968 .
[ 11 ]
Paul and his wife then relocated to Texas , where he began a private practice in obstetrics and gynecology .
[ 12 ] He refused to accept Medicaid or Medicare payments ; he routinely lowered fees for patients who could not afford to pay .
[ 13 ] [ 14 ]
1969 to 2012 is 43 years @...
He has n't practiced since the early 90 's at the latest , but Sallow 's claim was that he had n't practiced in 40 years which was inaccurate .
The Catholic Church is opposed to contraception for moral reasons .
Where is the morality in creating a life when food and clean water are rare commodities ?
Where poverty exists and educational opportunities are non existent ?
Where is the morality when disease is spread ?
Where is the morality when a women is the victim of domestic violence ?
When a women is forced to conceive and then trapped as the child become a lever to gain more power and more control ?
"@ Aw , fer crissakes @.....
we 're just talkin @' about a lil @' job - security , here !!!! @"
The Catholic Church speaks to all of these things , dumbass .
It also speaks out against the death penalty .
Next !
I am with you .
If you can n't feed , house and take care of a baby you have no business having one .
Yup , if you can n't provide for the child do n't have it .
If you can n't provide , do n't get pregnant .
Personally , I 'm a fan of contraception .
As far as your questions about the morality of other issues , I would bet the Church also views those as important .
However , when it comes to the soul and the physical being , in the Church 's eyes , the soul trumps the former .
And , they have always wanted more souls to watch over .
Fill that basket , you know .
Not my view , either .
But , I 'm not the Church .
And , I have no interest in telling the Church what to do ( as if they 'd listen anyway ) ; I just cast my '@ vote @' concerning the Church with my feet .
But , as I am a big fan of the Constitution , I sure as hell do n't want my government telling the Church or any other religious organization what is kosher to believe and what is n't .
If the Church believes that the soul is more important than the physical being , that is their prerogative .
( I will n't be joining them or '@ going back @' anytime soon , though . )
So , in your opinion , a church which engages in animal sacrifice or practices polyandry / polygamy should be beyond the reach of law ?
Actually , I 'm a fan of the First Amendment and agree with the SCOTUS on what few limitations we place on it .
Food and clean water are rare commodities ??
Not in this country they are not .
The church is a global institution @....
or have you missed the catholic charities commercials with the starving children in third world countries with no water , food , shelter or education ?
Oh yes I 've seen the commercials .
but I do n't trust everything ad I see on TV .
when you force women to have children they may not want , in many cases they become dependent on the state for services such as medicaid , food stamp , welfare , the foster system , etc. etc.
HEY !!
If you 've got some other way to keep some uppity @-@ woman ( who will n't play by God ' s rules ) in her place , " conservatives " are open to any @-@ and @-@ all suggestions !!!!
There is a difference between disallowing a behavior and forcing someone into a behavior .
That 's not responsive to the question .
And to suggest that members of the Supreme Court are always wise and just disregards history .
If you 've got some other way to keep some uppity @-@ woman ( who will n't play by God ' s rules ) in her place , " conservatives " are open to any @-@ and @-@ all suggestions !!!!
Are you trying to suggest all conservatives are religious ?
If so you should rethink that angle .
I can tell everyone that many years ago contraception was an issue for our family .
We could n't afford it .
The result was a beautiful Baby Boy .
The little cuss is now 6 @'@ 1 @" Married has is own house and works for Boeing .
So the church is disabllowing its members from using birth control , the punishment for doing so will be the loss of entry into heaven .
How is that different than forcing a behavior ?
Hold on .
What country are you talking about ?
Food and water are scarce ?
Educational opportunity is non @-@ existant ?
I know you 're not talking about America .
If you talking about another country than that 's the country 's problem , not the church 's .
The Catholic are against contraceptives because they want as many members as they can get .
It has nothing to do with morals .
Please see syreen 's post above , it is clear , concise and convincing .
Now , if that does n't knock her off her chair I 'll give up .
*@ passes totally out !
I 'm in favor of feeding , clothing , and giving shelter to the poor .
I 'm against all the gov't institutions that tax our brains out and who inefficiently attempt to provide some of these things .
If that were true , you 'd have a point .
But it is not , so you do n't .
Another fail .
You 're on a roll !
Good luck with that !
Rick will be proud .
It was a question , not a statement of fact .
The church does prohibit birth control , does it not ?
Is the use of BC something one must confess to return to a state of grace ?
If this is true , one must conclude ( if they are honest ) that such is a form of power and control over the freedom of the individual , for without grace entry to heaven is problematic .
As said by many , if you can n't afford a dollar for a condom , you have two choices .
1 ) keep it in your pants or 2 ) keep your legs closed @...
Depending on you sex .
To force a church to go against its beliefs just so some poor fool can have sex without danger of getting a girl pregnant makes so little sense I can n't believe people here are even defending it .

If you want to take away religious freedoms , you better come up with a better plan then '@ but I can n't afford a $ 1 condom @'
maybe churchs should n't operate hospitals then .
if they have a problem with performing or providing certain services that are part of that business model , then maybe they should n't be in that business to begin with .
why would an intelligent person get involved in a business in which parts of it could violate their beliefs ?
that would be like a devout muslim opening a liquor store but refusing to sell booze .
I guess I should have editted in '@ business discussion or hospital running to the redirect comment in my original post
Wry 's point is @....
that not suggesting or providing contraceptives in countries like this , only exacerbates the problem that they are trying to fix .
Why would you support giving birth to more babies into such desperate squalor .
Good grief , stop it .
Now I must give you a positive rep .
You have already passed me out @..
please do n't try an kill me off .
The church is not the one who decides who goes to heaven or hell .
The church 's doctrine does not permit birth control but it does not use any force to get the congregation to comply .
They leave that up to the individuals own conscience and consequence .

No you 're not a genius , though the ability to hold two contradictory beliefs suggests something , something other than genius .
Parse you second paragraph and maybe you 'll understand my point .
Alright , by all means please use your liberal mind to help my simple brain understand this concept .
I willingly give money to charities to help the poor+speak out against gov't institutions that take away the aspect of choice and are n't as efficient as charities = I 'm against giving money to help the poor , even though that 's exactly what I did .
Please please help me understand that equation .
the GOP has an agenda .
They wholeheartedly disagree with the idea that Goveernment can dictate via law what an enterpsie can and can not sell .
If the product or service is legal , they should be allowed to sell it .
If they choose NOT to sell it , that should be THEIR choice .
That is the crux oif the debate .
It happens to be contraception right now @...
but all along the agenda is the same @.....
government has no right to tell ANYONE that they HAVE to SELL anything .
i think the crux of the debate is people understanding that contraception ( as provided by health care providers ) will not "@ free . @"
it will be included in the cost of your original premium .
thus they can not charge an extra co pay or fee for .
there are other services this applies to as well , such as mammograms .
now @...
should all men who pay premiums demand that women pay for their own mammograms since 99 % of men do not get them ?
the way health ( and really all ) insurance works is that you pay a premium for access to services .
when you pay your premium and do not receive any services , you area subsidizing someone else 's services .
so every month i pay premiums , i help to pay for some guys viagra , or some womans pap smear , or some kids physical .
should i be raising hell that they should be paying for those services themselves ?
but your insurance contract will not allow for that .
call your insurance company and demand that none of your premium dollars be used for any services or treatment you disagree with and see what happens .
Take a pill so you can fuck your brains out is not the same thing as getting a mammogram to see if you have cancer .
Do n't be fucking retarded .
The crux of the debate is that the State went into a Church and directed them to do something against their faith .
You get all hot and bothered when that same State invades your bedroom .
It is very revealing of your two @-@ facedness you do n't mind it invading a Church .
although you can take that same pill to control acne and hormone levels as well .
not all women use the pill as a pregnancy prevention device .
It 's real simple @: Get the hell out of everybody 's bedroom and start worrying about the economy .
This contraception thing is nothing but a new shiny object to distract the easily distracted and unfocused Republicans .
All you say is true @....
but you need to remember @...
it is insurance @...
so whereas someone else uses viagara , and you do n't , you have the policy just in case ytou DO need viagara .
It is like flood insurance .
I have it , but never used it .
My premium is paying for the poor guy that had to make a claim .
I am OK with that .
If I were n't , I have the right to call another insurance company and try to get a better rate .
But again @...
the real topic is the mandate @...
"@ ALL INSURANCE COMPANIES MUST OFFER THE SERVICE @" @...
It is government intrusion into an iundustry .
I understand why government says you can n't sell somethiong for it has been found to be dangerous @...
But to FORCE SOMEONE TO SELL SOMETHING ?
It is not OK in my book .
And by the way @...
my wife and I enjoy sex @....
but we are done with having kids @...
so yes , we use contracption @...
in many varieties @......
I am not against contraception @...
I am against government mandating one must offer it @....
even if it goes against their personal morals .
Weak .
You are shameless .
Holding up a few people with medical problems as human shields so everyone else can get their fuck @-@ at @-@ will pill .
Alcohol is used in medicines .
Therefore , because of this sick guy over here who can n't afford his medicine , Congress should make colleges pay for students to get free liquor .
That is the kind of logic you are using , and the kind of logic Ms. Fluke used .
How about we just help actual sick people instead ?
My god !
That might actually help keep health care costs down !
Can n't have that !
So , you support taking away religious liberty .
Nice .
Idiot .
I 'm sorry , but how does providing abortions equate with healing the sick in a Catholic hospital ?
I know of grocery stores who will n't sell tobacco .
It 's their choice as to what services they will provide and what they will n't .
At least it is in a free society .
where in the bible does it talk about the church offering medical services ?
i do n't remember that being part of the catholic doctrine .
This is some really weird retroactive time warp shit .
You seem pretty clueless to the fact that Catholic hospitals have been around a long time and have not been violating their beliefs .
Their "@ business model @" has been thriving .
If you want to go the whole muslim route , then to make your completely false analogy a true one , what Obama has done is force a Muslim @-@ operated convenience store which has been around for more than a century to start selling booze .
And then here comes you , saying "@ Gee , why would a Muslim have a business model that violates his beliefs ?
I do n't get it ! @"
if you rule that religious hospitals apply for exemptions to laws based on religious beliefs , you up a whole different set of issues than just the contraception issue .
i could make the argument ( in court ) that my religion prohibits me from providing cancer drugs , aids drugs , heart drugs , or cholesterol drugs , or any other drug on the market .
would that be an acceptable consequence in your mind ?
Has anyone ever done that ?
No ?
Okay .
Just keep making shit up .
In fact withholding lifesaving drugs by a parent because of their religion has been litigated , and the parents lost .
Not the same thing as a hospital withholding care , now is it .
But keep trying .
I 'm sure there 's a slippery slope around here somewhere that is n't fallacious .
the child did not have t6he choice to be brought upo by parents that woulde allow meidcal care @...
it had to be decided as it was .
One can get a job at a different hospital if they do not like the health insurance offered .
i do n't see where providing free abortions is part of this discussion
I hate to break it to you , but grade school boys tall enough to reach the rubber machine on the truck stop bathroom wall can get contraception for next to nothing .
Or you can go to planned parenthood where it 's passed out like candy .
You do n't need insurance to get contraception .
It 's readily available off the shelf .
Actually , the whole "@ contraception @" drum is being pounded by the liberals in an attempt at gotcha politics .
If one were being honest , they would know this is about constitutional freedoms rather than denying women "@ health care @" .
But that is if one is being honest .
sometime rights come into conflict and they need to be resolved .
in this case it is the freedom of choice vs. the freedom of religion .
the courts will have a difficult time deciding this one .
if you rule for freedom of religion , you trample someones right , but if you rule for freedom of choice , you trample someone elses rights .
its a double edged sword .
as cruel as it sound , i would argue freedom of choice wins out on this fact and this alone .
the US is a secular society and not everyone believe in or follow religion .
now people are still free to choose which religion to follow , but ( in this case ) ruling in favor or religion would in effect make those of us who do not adhere to that religion forced to follow part of its doctrine .
opinions ?
But do n't you get it ?
The GOP is fighting for freedom of choice .
They are fighting the idea that goivernment has the right to mandate that an insuirance company MUST sell a service @...
even if they do n't want to .
Ironically @....
they are fightiong for freedom of choice .
Freedom of religion started iut @...
yes @....
but Obamas "@ compromise @" was to minimize freedom of choice for the insurance companies .
So now it is a fight for freedom of choice .
You are aware of course of all of the charitable work the Catholic church does in each of the areas you mention are n't you ?
Wry has pretty much already told me in this thread that doing things charitably is meaningless , it has to be done by gov't .
The cathlic church could cure cancer and hand out the cure for free , but if there 's no gov't mandate involved , Wry would n't support it .
LOL , we both know you 're full of shit , that said , when you grow up your opinions will change .
the GOP is fighting for freedom of religion .
the left is fighting for freedom of choice .
you have it backwards .
the GOP is fighting on the basis of religious institutions .
where in the discussion has kaiser , united health care or blue cross / blue shield come up ?
they have n't raised any moral issues or issues of any kind with having to provide contraception at no additional cost .

Do you and others believe the couple were unjustly found guilty and should not have been sent to prison ?
Why is an abortion taking a life and praying over a dying infant and not calling 911 an exercise of religious freedom ?
What ?
Do you see the word free in regard to abortions in my post you responded to ?
Me either ?
I did mention a "@ free @" society , which means free of government forcing you to provide services you choose not to .
I 've already asked and you 've clarified it .
Even if you 're the most giving person to charity , unless you support gov't mandates , you are n't charitable .
I 'm doubting as I grow up I 'll become a partisan hack .
I realized both parties were shit in my teens , it 's shocking to me that others have n't .
Partisan blinders always conquer common sense .
No sir .
You have it wrong .
It started as freedom of religion when the Catholic Church complained .
Obama agreed and compromised .
However , the compromise meant that insurance companies can be told by government that they MUST offer something , even if it goes against their morals .
When has ANY business been told they MUST offer a service ?
It is about freedom of choice .
The left wants the people to get BC form any insurance company they want to @......
at the cost of freedom of choiuce for the owners of the insurance companies .

providing abortions for free are not part of this discussion .
unless somehow in your twisted mine the pill is equal to an abortion
no matter how much you keep telling yourself that , its not the essence of the debate .
show me where the health insurance companies are coming together to protest the contraception mandate .
they are not , it is the church and religious institutions involved in health care .
i did n't know they church sold insurance now ?
this is news to us all @....
you do realize that there is a difference between an insurance company and a health care provider right ?
If this was truly about medical health , then it would be about condoms and not the pill .
The women who need the pill for legitimate medical reasons are a tiny minority who would incur a very small cost to the healthcare system for their medication .
To use these innocent women as human shields is vile , disgusting , shameless behavior .
The rest of the women who want the pill would multiply the cost by a factor of ten .
And so these women need to justify the expenditure .
They have not .
For these women , the pill serves no preventative medical purpose whatsoever .
In fact , a condom is far safer as it actually prevents the spread of disease .
But they did not ask for condoms .
And that is why they can not hide the fact this is about subsidizing their sex life , which is a totally bogus argument for a handout .
So that is the end of that .
For the pro @-@ life camp , they do n't get off so easy from me , either .
For decades , pro @-@ lifers have been bitching about Planned Parenthood .
Planned Parenthood gets federal funds to hand out birth control .
Most people , including pro @-@ lifers , are NOT morally opposed to birth control .
However , money is fungible and so when you give cash to PP for birth control , that frees up other monies which can be spent performing abortions .
While Congress is technically not funding abortions , it actually is .
For the life of me , I do not know why after all these years it has not occurred to the pro @-@ life movement to open their own women 's clinics which can then be used to provide adoption services , pre @-@ natal care , and birth control .
And if Congress is going to be spending money on birth control regardless of whether or not you think they should , then these clinics should get that birth control money , too .
And there will not be any stain on that money abetting abortions .
This is America , and we thrive on free enterprise and competition .
Time to wake up and get smart , folks .
what health conditions does condoms treat or prevent ?
i did n't know acne could be controlled with condoms , i did n't know ovarian cysts could be treated with condoms , i did n't know hormones could be regulated with condoms .
your issue is with people having sex for pleasure .
get over it .
Some institutions are self insured because they make enough profit to cover the liabilities .
i find it much more interesting that the religious right pushes for abortion to become illegal , because life is sacred , while at the same time opposing universal health care .
its extremely hypocritical to say life is sacred when your willing to fight to protect an unborn life , but not willing to fight to protect people who have already been born .
Actually , It is how this Universal Health care is implemented .
The method this adminstration is using is more of a corporatists venture in which the citizen is forced to buy insurance .
The preferred method for a universal health care is more of a socialistic venture in which everyone contributes to a fund to pay for the health care .
Both methods have draw backs , the corporatist approach still institutes the insurance companies which will seek to turn a profit by short changing the policy @--@ also , by forcing demand , the insurance companies can raise their rates to ensure more profit for their companies .
There is little reason not to do this since the competitive spirit of the free market is being challenged by the lack of choice including not buying .
The socialistic approach is still faced with rising costs in comparison to standard of living and the inefficiency of government .
Pluss extra .
what is wrong with a system where everyone pays the same and everyone gets access to the same services ?
( i.e. single payer )
They are n't pro life @...
they 're pro birth .
if they were n't , they 'd be arranging adoptions for unwanted children .
if they were n't , they 'd be supporting day care and job training and education for unwed mothers
if they were n't , they 'd support WIC and head start .
but they are @....
because it is n't about "@ life @" , it 's about punishing the harlots and making women incubators .
which is why something like 80 % of anti @-@ choice activists are men .
Hmmmm ?
All of the church organizations providing such services would beg to differ with you .
Feel free to Google .
Liberals and contraception .
What a laugh .
You people stick your dicks into anything moist .
Life 's one big immoral party to asswipes like you .
Buy your own rubbers asswipe .
tell that to Rick Santorum
I thought it was Obama that started the contraception thing .
It was .
It was Santorum that let Obama off the hook by being stupid enough to give the liberal media plenty of sound bytes that enabled them to shift the focus from Obama 's dumb fuck position on contraception to Santorum 's dumb fuck position on contraception .
The Catholic Church is hugely involved in adoption services .
It also funds programs such as day care for single parents ( of either gender ) @.....
we also provide school places , for kids from all faiths , and no faith @....
Do n't let the facts get in the way , though .
I have given to Boys Town for many years and I am not even Catholic .
I guess there are dozens of programs for girls , and I felt the boys need a leg up as well .
Perhaps the solution to this biological problem , that has become political , is for the Church and Republican party to finance some type of creation or solution that when added to our drinking water removed the sex drive .
I remember in the Fifties conservatives did not want flouride added to the water because flouride turned people into communists .
If they can create a flouride that makes people communists surely they can come up with some kind of drug that destroys the sex thing .
What about that claim about a communist plot ?
Fluoridation was required in East Germany as long as the communists were in charge .
When the German Democratic Republic disappeared and the country was reunified in 1990 , fluoridation stopped .
It is prohibited in Germany now .
The claim is no longer made because it seems so @...
1950 s .
But it was n’t far off

We prefer a nice sterile hospital room to leave babies to cry themselves to death alone .
Sure @...

That happens SO OFTEN .
If someone has a moral objection to contraception , women are going to be the victims of domestic violence as if no woman that has ever used contraception has been the victim of a abusive partner .
Sue your high school English teacher .
LOL , so true , and so sad .
For example , it 's okay for you to impose your value , because you are special ?
In your own mind , maybe , outside of it , the word may take on a different meaning .
Neither government nor people should impose their values on anyone .
Idea Censorship is offensive to some , might want to consider the effects of what you advocate .
Ideas are fine .
I am all for ideas .
But when they are of a moral or religious nature it 's not government 's business .
If you want to change society 's morals you appeal to the hearts and minds of the people that are willing to listen and if they embrace it what you find to be immoral will eventually die out on it 's own .
Government forcing a moral or religious principle creates rebellion and in the end delays or prevents it being embraced by society .
History is pretty clear on this one .
Actually it is not .
Maybe in the past , arguably .
Yet , Today we fight over everything from the definition of Marriage to when does Human Life start .
You might want to consider the distinction between Principle , and Dogma .
Principle has every place in a civilized Society , through Culture , and Law .
Dogma , has none .
You got to admit it turned out to be an awesome trick to get conservatives to reveal even more of how ridiculous their beliefs are .
And as you get older and understand how the world actually works you will realize how stupid you sound .
Either that or you 'll turn into Barney Frank and move to P-town .
Legal codes enforce matters properly defined in philosophy as ethical or moral .
"@ Thou shall not steal @" is a moral imperative ( or a Commandment from God ) and codified in the Penal Code of all states .
Government does enforce morality .
Laws against theft and murder were around a long time before Moses wrote them on a rock .
Did we forget that Moses was forced to flee Egypt for murdering someone ?
Theft is illegal not because it 's necessarily immoral but because it infringes on the rights of others .
Of course there were prohibitions against theft and murder before Moses , that was expressed in my post ( Moral Imperative ) .
Can you clarify your remark , specifically , "@ theft is illegal not because it 's necessarily immoral @" with an example of when theft is moral or amoral ?
moral theft @...
stealing the car keys off a drunk driver .
The Churches take on morality is theirs and theirs alone .

End of inaccessible birth control lie .
As to the food and water issue , The Catholic Church alone , has done more to get more food and water to starving people then you have or ever will .
Its there right to provide there employees what the will .
The point I made regarding food and clean water , as well as disease , was focused specifically on current events in Africa .
Not only is the Catholic Church opposed to contraception but the Bush Adminsitrtion was opposed to any efforts to protect pregnanat women ( and their unborn children ) from disease - water born & AIDS - and poor prenatal nutrition .
I have no doubt the Catholic Church engages in good works and I have no problem with their moral objection to abortion .
What I object to , strongly , is stupidity .
How is preventing a child 's conception a moral issue and how is it any business of the church .
The answer is quite simple , more births = more Catholics = more power and money .
cause the church do n't come into your bedroom .
idiot .
a great many catholics do purchase and use birth control @..
they 're smarter than obie wan though , they have enough sense not to demand that the church pay for it .
boy is he dumb as a box of rocks .
What the frack have you been smoking ?
The Bush administration expanded aid to Africa and threw a lot of money behind the effort to stop the spread of AIDS .
He did a lot of things wrong , but that is one thing he got right , you should give yourself a wedgie for lying about it .
By the way , how is a preventing pregnancy not a moral issue ?
Do you think it was immoral for the US government to sterilize people without their knowledge simply because many progressives thought it was a good idea ?
The Catholic church should concern themselves with trying to keep their house in order .
The pervert priests throughout the existence of the church should be of greater concern than what people think about contraception .
Fortunately the Catholic Church has been losing its power , and because of the pervert priest scandals , its money for some time now .
They are nothing more than hypocrites in a big way .
Contraception is about responsible parenthood .
Why would Republicans choose to make it an issue in an election year is beyond me .
For some reason , anything having to do with sex puts them in a tizzy
Republicans did not , and are not , making contraception an issue .
Ummmmm @....
it seems they are
Cracked that door a little bit and social conservatives came running through
Republicans are against women 's health because they do n't believe government should provide them with free contraception with money confiscated by government guns .
You do n't think that 's making contraception an issue ?
Seriously ?
All that for a little pill ?
That would certainly be a good example .
But more to the point that there are laws which certainly coincide with a "@ moral code @" such as laws against murder or theft but the real sticking point is that those acts violate the rights of others .
People often make the argument that our laws are based on the ten commandments or are based on Judeo @-@ Christian theology and that 's not quite the case .
Only two ( arguably three or four ) of the commandments are enforced by law in the United States and those that are existed in most societies long before Judaism even entered the picture .
Other laws based on a moral belief ( such as the Massachusetts "@ crimes against chastity laws @" ) have been declared to be unconstitutional .
So what I am getting at is that government only enforces "@ morality @" when it happens to coincidentally do so in the act of protecting the personal rights of other people .
I am sure there are exceptions that can be found and certainly there are still "@ moral laws @" on the books , but for the most part they are rarely enforced or they get shot down when brought before the SCOTUS unless they have some secondary purpose that overrides the moral purpose .
Most crimes in the Penal Code - and other codes - have victims , and are therefore protecting the rights of others .
There are exceptions however , being under the influence of a drug or narcotic is one , a women exposing her breast in public is another .
Are n't these examples of the government enforcing a moral code ?
Socialists / Progressives like to have it both ways on issues like this .
They do n't really want the Government out of the bedroom .
They only want that when it 's convenient for them .
They fully support the Government forcing Taxpayers to subsidize fellow Citizens @' personal sexual behavior .
They also fully support forcing Taxpayers to subsidize Abortions .
So they 're not very honest or consistent .
It 's time for Big Government to really get out of the bedroom .
Let the age of personal responsibility dawn .
No , they do n’t , because they know it ’s illegal to use taxpayers @’ funds to subsidize abortion .
So liberals do n’t want to ‘@ have it both ways , @’ they ’re being perfectly honest and consistent .
If conservatives really want ‘@ Big Government ’@ out of the bedroom and an age of ‘@ personal responsibility @’ to dawn , then they need to cease their efforts to violate a woman ’s right to privacy with regard to abortion and access to contraceptives .
The hypocrisy and ignorance belongs to conservatives alone .
<a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2010/04/the-abortion-issue/"> FactCheck.org : The Abortion Issue </a>
Unless of course one is dealing with conservatives who oppose abortion for women in cases of rape or incest , or to save the life of the mother ; in addition to being ignorant hypocrites , such conservatives are also criminals .
Juxtaposing abortions and bedrooms is a little strange , do n't you think ?
Especially on top of the false claim that women are being denied access to contraceptives .
Sex is optional .
You can either choose to have sex or knot .
If you choose to have sex you should act like a good girl and not a whore .
A whore expects others to pay for her to play @..
So any woman whose insurance company currently covers birth control is a whore
Thanks for clarifying
did n't say that tampon .
if they willingly pay for it that 's their choice , , forced is another matter @..
but then we girls do n't expect tampons to know much .
Clarifying ?
That one did n't make sense @...
even for you @...
Seriously , if we oppose government forcing insurance companies to pay for contraceptives then we 're against insurance companies paying for contraceptives ?
The concept of free choice for both companies and consumers is n't even on your radar ?
I 'm familair with sex but did n't know the alternative was @" knot @" .
Is that something one does with their SO ?
Oh !
I bet you meant Twister .
Knot is what some Women do with their tubes .
Insurance covers thousands of medications and procedures .
Are they being "@ forced @" on you too ?
These are private personal matters .
They are not Government matters .
The Government should not be involved with these issues at all .
Have all the Contraceptives & Abortions you want , just do n't demand fellow Citizens pay for it .
Your personal sexual behavior is your business & responsibility .
Fellow Citizens / Taxpayers are not responsible for subsidizing your personal sexual behavior .
The Government needs to get out of the bedroom once and for all .
read my several posts on how health insurance actually works and realize that you already pay for other peoples services .
and you raising issues with your health care provider already ?
making sure that none of your premiums dollars are going towards services you disagree with ?
Not a Government issue .
The Government should not force anyone to pay for someone else 's personal sexual behavior .
Have all the Contraception & Abortions you want , but pay for it yourself .
The Government should n't be involved with these issues .
since the government is not providing services , your argument is invalid .
and im glad to see you skipped over the rest of my argument on how insurance works in general .
so i assume you are ok with paying your premiums to your health insurance company knowing that they provide abortions ?
Some things i just can n't control .
I do n't like Abortion but if Health Insurance covers it , than so be it .
But the Government should n't be involved with issues like this .
Contraception and Abortion are private personal matters .
again since they are not providing it , i do n't see how it is your concern .
would you as upset if they mandated that mammograms be provided at no extra charge ?
because thats part of the ACA as well .
man you need to go back and get an education of at least the high school level .
so lets use your car insurance analogy .
so you have car insurance ( mandated by the government none the less ) .
and you get in an accident and cause damage .
we 'll even take your liability case as an example .
the damage you cause is $ 75,000 .
now youve only had insurance for 1 years at a rate of $ 50 per month .
so you in essence have paid $ 600 into the insurance pool .
now where does the other $ 74,400 come from ?
Other peoples premiums !!!!!
holy shit , so other people are actually paying for your mistakes .
you are correct in one thing , and that is insurance helps spread the risk .
now if you have full coverage insurance and you get hurt , then your insurance company will pay out to yourself .
same example , if you have had insurance for 1 year and have been paying $ 50 a month ( $ 600 a year ) and get in an accident that is your fault and your medical bills are $ 200,000 .
where does that other $ 199,400 come from ?
ohhh thats right other people premiums !!!!!
amazing , you do n't understand how this works .
How does that disprove my assertion that buying insurance is paying another person to assume the risk ?
but you are wrong in the way it works behind the scenes .
i never said it was a fee based services .
i said you pay a fee for "@ access @" to medical services .
that fee is called a premium .
you fail to understand that somewhere somehow the actual cost for your services is paid for by the pool of money the company bring in through premiums .
if an insurance company is paying out more in services than they are getting in premiums they current do 2 things .
they drop those who cost too much to insure , or they raise rates to cover those services .
regardless , the money that actually pays doctors is from the pool of premiums that everyone pays .
hence you pay other peoples services every day of the week .
whether you want to admit it or not .
but the again the right is n't big on facts .
Again , a premium is not so you have access to service , your premium is paid to another person so they assume the risk .
How the person , or company , deals with that risk is irrelevant , you are not paying them so you can access services .
Hence , no one pays anyone for anyone else 's services ever .
This is the last time I am going to explain this , so feel free to blather your ignorance in assurance that I will not again explain why the sky is blue .
Feel free to insist it is orange and declare victory if you like , it will n't bother me .
Everyone remember the sky is orange because Syohon says it is .
Time to get the Government out of the bedroom .
No more having it both ways .
The Government does n't belong being involved with such private personal matters .
And they definitely should n't be forcing anyone to pay for someone else 's Contraception & Abortions .
Taxpayers are not required to fund fellow Citizens @' personal sexual behavior .
It 's the individual Citizens @' responsibility to fund their own behavior .
You want to be promiscuous and have several Abortions ?
Well then you have to take personal responsibility and fund that behavior yourself .
It 's not your fellow Citizens @' responsibility to do that .
Big Government needs to be booted out of these personal social issues .
They 're clearly over @-@ reaching now .
I find this issue rather interesting myself .
The left yells and holler that they demand government to stay out of the bedroom and "@ private affairs @" with respect to Defense Of Marriage Act and same sex marriage , yet they really do n't want government out of the bedroom because the left is now trying everything to connect contraception with the notion that it 's somehow a HEALTH issue .
It 's not a health issue in the respect that mamograms are , it 's just another "@ give me , give me @" entitlement .
What exactly entitles government to give you free contraception , to in effect have taxpayers PAY for your extracurricular activities ?
Health insurance should be treated with various cover options with everyone that seeks to have health care coverage paying for BASIC services .
If you want the cadillac option that includes free contraception , free viagra , free gym membership and weight loss programs , etc. then that individual must pay for the added individual premium coverage for those desired programs .
Government should stay out of issues such as these , period .
It 's not the Federal Government 's job to be and act as the "@ responsible @" parent , because some complaining entitlement supporters choose not to be .
Contraception is about family planning , not about wild sex .
You can have wild sex without contraception .
It is in the interest of the society that unwanted children be kept to a minimum .
It reduces the abortion rate , the number of children born to single mothers and the burden on society
As such , government has the right to require insurance companies , which make a tremendous amount of money off of our society to include contraceptive coverage .
We tried to implement a government insurance option and insurance companies spent billions to block it .
This is part of their payback
How about you worry about purchasing your own condoms .
If your Dick falls off because you catch something because you put is some place you should not have , I give you my permission to blame me .
Why not just make all contraception free ?
Maybe do Contraception Bouquets at FTD or Pro Flowers .
Totally free of course .
Contraception is a Right , correct ?
How many Soldiers have died protecting your Right to stick it where you want without having to take any responsibility ?
That is what Liberty is about , after all .
There is nothing nobler that I can think of , than having the Greater Society take responsibility over who get 's born .
You are way ahead of the Pack , Comrade .
Most contraception is used by married couples who are trying to responsibly control the number of children they have .

what is the moral opposition to birth control ?
Insurance will pay for those because it 's cheaper than the costs associated with a baby .
It 's an economic decision for the insurance company not a moral one
Agreed
Complete bullshit .
It 's in an insurance company 's best financial interests to do so hence the reason why most of them do , BUT the government has no right to require that of anyone whether it 's a religious organization ( such as one run by the Catholic Church ) with a moral purpose for not providing it or a secular company with a bad grasp of economics .
Every Progressive leader from Hitler , to Mao to Pol Pot feel just as you do
At the same time the government should not be forcing people to pay for other 's people 's contraception or forcing insurance companies to offer coverage for contraception if they choose not too
you pay for other peoples health care every time you pay your insurance premiums @....
are you protesting your current insurance company as right now ?
If it is dictated by the government it is not an economic decision , it is a political one .
Still think the sky is green ?

No decent Catholic / Christian should support them .
Hopefully both perversions are eradicated .
the government did n't say you directly pay for other peoples health care idiot .
the law says the health care providers can not change an extra co @-@ pay or co @-@ insurance for contraception .
its not free , its simply included in the cost of your premium .

Again ,
What does that have to do with the point that the government should not be forcing people to pay for other people 's contraception or force insurance companies to provide coverage for contraception .
I do n't have to have insurance , its still a choice .
How an insurance company uses the money from the premiums to pay for other people 's health care is their business .
If they want to charge extra for contraception coverage that is also also their business not the government 's you arrogant prick .
you have no idea what this conversation is even about .
point to where the government says you will pay for other peoples contraception ?
the argument stems from a portion of the law that states all insurance plans must provide contraception as a services .
and that service will be provided for no extra charge .
meaning no extra copay or coinsurance .
do you have any idea how insurance actually works already ?
get an education dumbass .
Do you have any idea that I am making a philosophical point ?
Apparently not .
Did you fail to understand my other philosophical point that the government should not be forcing insurance companies to provide services ?
Apparently so .
How insurance works ?
Education ?
Really ?
Get over your superiority complex dickhead
if you do n't understand a simple premise like how insurance works obviously can n't understand the rest of the argument .
so what you are really advocating is that insurance companies and health care providers not be regulated to have uniform standards ?
hmmm like all those ethical insurance companies who used to drop people when they got sick , or refused to provide them certain services they thought were too expensive , or refused to provide coverage to people with pre @-@ existing conditions .
hmmm sounds like a wonderfully perfect system .
pretty soon they will n't have any regulations , and then they will n't have to provide services to anyone who can n't pay full price for the services .
so no one will have access to coverage .
Again ,
Wait a minute .
Are n't you the guy that insists that premiums go directly to pay for other people 's services ?
How can you argue that and , at the same time , argue that people are n't actually paying for other people 's services ?
Again ,
He has trouble with complex chains of thought .
First off , the fact that health care costs so much and that so many people have to have insurance , ( which was originally created to be only for catastrophic situations ) just to walk into a doctor 's office is because the government 's overinvolvement in health care .
But that 's for a whole other discussion
Government has restricted market forces from weeding out insurance companies who act out as you stated by preventing people from purchasing insurance across state lines .
This created an artificial monopoly where costs go up and coverage grows poorer .
Open up access and competition increases .
Increased competition means lower cost and better coverage for everyone .
Should people have recourse if the insurance company screws the person over by not providing an agreed upon paid for service ?
Yes !
In a free market these companies will go out of business real fast .
Should the government mandate what services an insurance company provides ?
No .
Government is not the solution , its the problem .
But that 's just my opinion as is yours that the government is the solution .
OK , we disagree .
i think when the free market fails to provide an adequate service such a basic health care at an affordable price government intervention can force change .
since the majority of people on this thread have basically decided that access to affordable health care is not a basic right and people do not deserve it , this rules out universal health ( unlike most of the rest of the industrialized world ) .
this being said , government regulation of this can provide a framework to make it accessible by more people than it currently it .
government is not always the solution , but neither is the free market .
just use the financial markets betwen 2004 and 2008 as an example of this .
If the insurance industry operated in a regulated free market there would be little or any threat of the horrors of dropped coverage , etc. because the market would weed out bad actors .
Not only that , prices would fall as insurance companies would lose their protected markets .
People would have more choice .
They could shop for the kind of coverage they wish to buy .
And if you or anyone else thinks Obamacare 's mandate that pre existing conditions must be covered is going to work , your nuts .
Private insurers will simply stop writing health coverage and will of course drop existing insureds when their policies expire .
Of course this is the goal of Obamacare .
To create a system where the only insurer available if the federal government .
Obama gets his wish for socialized medicine .
And we get shitty rationed care by doctors who are from third world countries , can barely speak English and are more likely to screw up .
they did operate in a free market between 1990 and 2008 .
how did the free market work out during that time ?
If they operated in a free market why were they required to cover so many different things under penalty of law ?
I do n't know what God thinks about it and will not lie and tell you I do know .
I think that birth control should remain legal as even if it is wrong , · the person has the right to chose to do it any way .
I am not for it or against , I am not a woman though .
I do believe that abortion is a sin as I see it as murder , which is why I am lead to believe that birth control should not be thought of as wrong as it could save a person from committing a sin by having to have an abortion .
Where if they had been taking birth control they never would have had to commit a sin .
Everybody who has insurance pays for other people 's claims .
The purpose of insurance is to spread the risk around .
Some people will never have a claim .
Others will have many claims .
Do you own a home ?
Think about how much your homeowner 's insurance costs you .
I had a patient in his 80 s a couple weeks ago who has owned a home for 50 years .
He said he figured up that over his lifetime he has paid $ 50,000 in premiums , but has never filed a claim .
I have n't figured up mine because I 've moved several times .
Too much trouble .
But mine right now is pretty high .
I 've only filed one claim and that was for a roof damaged by hail .
$ 5,000 .
I 've paid in much more .
But the others who have lost everything have been covered because I have joined in and help , with my premiums , to spread the risk around .
That 's how all insurance works .
Med mal , health , car , you name it .
The name of the game is spreading out the risk .
If you never have a claim , you pay for everyone else 's !
If I were an insurance company , I would pay for contraception .
It would mean fewer dependents to cover .
Not true .
If you have insurance you are paying a third party to assume the risk for your claims .
Most insurance companies use the money from premiums to pay claims , but that does not mean that the person paying the premium is actually paying the claim .
There are insurance pools set up where people do pay for other people 's claims , but they do that by sending payment directly to the person that needs the money , not to the doctor or hospital .
Well , if you were a a private insurance company you should have the choice to offer contraception coverage or not .
Not be required to do so or not by the government .
As far as premiums paying for other people 's claims , is it really relevant ?
I still have the choice to pay for insurance or not .
Another issue is the federal government is not even authorized to provide health care .
If we want to do this the constitution must be amended ( not that the Federal government even follows the constitution anyway ) However , if the people of the individual states want to have their state government run their health care that 's completely fine .
Just do n't expect the people of the other states that do n't want it to pay for it .
The commerce clause , the 10 th amendment , and universal health care would be a court battle that 's for sure .
As for your comment
You are trying to make people who do n't support government run health care appear to lack compassion .
We already have a qausi socialized system .
There is already enough regulation to allow for recourse for declining paid for coverage .
I am of the opinion that free market forces will allow for greater ingenuity in medicine and lower costs through competition .
Artificial monopolies do n't work and they stagnate progress .
More government involvement will generate more problems .
We simply disagree on what the government 's role should be in health care .
In turn , what 's wrong with letting an individual state such as New York have government run care while New Hampshire does not ?
With the residents of New Hampshire not having to pay for New Yorkers @' health care .
my post is not advocating for a full government run system .
what i am simply pointing out that government regulation can provide an avenue for change .
which is what is happening here .
there are many good things in the health care law which everyone agrees are good .
things like making 80 % of premium dollars be used on patient care , not being able to drop patients when they get sick , the removal of lifetime caps , kids being able to stay on their parents insurance until 26 , mammograms at no additional costs , the elimination of pre @-@ exisiting conditions .
without government intervention then none of this would have happened .
the free market is not always the best solution .
look at natural monopolies such as utilities providers .
they have government regulated monopolies because it makes more sense logisitically and financially to have one say electricity provider instead of 20 in a given area .
look at what the free market did to the financial markets between 2004 and 2008 ?
the lack of regulation cause a huge financial collapse .
i have never said the government should run everything or is the perfect solution to every problem .
but @.....
government intervention and regulation can provide a positive avenue for change when the free market is not willing to do so .
health care costs have increased 10 fold since 1990 , and the average family is getting squeezed out of the insurance market .
all of this due to the free market .
how much longer should we wait to see if the free market corrects itself ?
10 more years ?
20 more ?
your notion of letting NY have state run health care but no NH opens a large amount of problems .
what if someone from NY travels to NH and gets hurt , but NH will not accept the NY health insurance ?
so the patient has to be transported back to NY at the possibility of dying .
if every state had their own standards of health care , each state would need to have an separate agreement with every other state to accept that states health insurance .
if a state is not willing to do so , then you create problems amongst the states .
you will have people who will not travel outside their state for fear of incurring costs associated with this .
you will also have 50 different form of health care .
what if NY had good health care , and NH did n't have good health care , would you allow the residents of NH to cross state lines and improve their health care ?
would NH be allow to restrict this through law ?
would people being to flee states due to lack of access to health care ?
if you create one single minimum standard that has met , you provide uniformity across the industry .
this does not stop providers from exceeding that standard , but it provides a framework with which to start .
is this such a terrible thing ?
"@ But what if @" @...
The dumbest question on planet Earth .

It is more complicated than that .
For one thing , what 's poor .
To the billionaire , the mere millionaire is very poor .
The poor in this country is beyond the wildest dreams wealthy of the poor in most of the world .
My step granddaughter is poor .
She lives below the poverty line .
Or does she ?
She is a single mother with four children from four different anonymous men .
She lives in Section 8 housing , a nice three bedroom two bath apartment .
Her utilities are all subsidized .
She had benefit provided telephone service and a benefit provided cell phone .
Her childen eat all three meals a day at school , but she still has a loaded EBT card .
In addition , there are food banks and food pantries where she does n't have to pay at all .
My step granddaughter does n't drive .
When she wants to go someplace she has generously been provided a transit card to take the bus .
If the bus does n't go where she wants to go she can call for a car .
There are a number of public benefit provided access cars .
It would be unfair to say she does n't work .
She provides child care to her friend 's three children .
She gets a check every month for that .
Her friend gets paid for providing child care to my step granddaughter 's children .
She gets her welfare check every month .
She has never had to buy her children Christmas presents .
They get dozens from any number of holiday giveaway programs .
Two of her children have been diagnosed as having some form of hyper activity disorder .
They get SSI .
All in all , her take home is in excess of $ 5,000 a month .
She can afford to get her hair and nails done regularly .
She can afford to pay for her medical marijuana which she needs for generalized stress .
Getting this kind of medical care as a public benefit is something she is vitally interested in . She is n't rich , but she certainly is quite comfortable .
It was n't always like this .
She was going to join the Coast Guard and get job training .
At one time she was considering culinary school and become a chef .
She had dreams at one time but all that was leached away because being poor was just so easy and so comfortable .
This sounds like someone who has learned how to game the system , and that is unfortunate .
I 'm sure there are a few people like that .
And there are people who are working poor taking some of these benefits to survive .
I do think that at least part of the problem is that the government makes it too easy to get benefits and does n't do anything to hold people to account .
What sounds devastating here is that there are four kids involved who are going to think that this is all perfectly normal and okay .
I would have no problem with a work requirement for welfare .
And drug testing , which liberals scream bloody murder about if anyone suggests it .
I think he was talking about those on welfare that choose to sit on there asses on welfare and do not even bother to look for work .
Not the poor who look for work and are just having a hard time finding it .
I 'll answer the question , those who choose to sit on their asses and not help themselves do not deserve the help of others .
Those that at least try to find work and do better for themselves deserve our help to get them on their feet .
then he should have said that @......
but he did not @......
If you listen to his whole quote instead of just being a left wing prick here and I 'm no Romney fan , Mitt was explaining how the poor had a safety net built in and the rich should n't worry but he was really concerned in this day and age the the middle class was losing everything they had gained slowly over all these decades .
But hey you want to lie because that 's the drum beat over this or to remain ignorant of the truth .
Odds are if you are a Democrat you are just a blatant liar .
was n't talking about what Romney said @.....

I wish them well .
I could tell you a similar story , with the biggest difference being intervention .
I have the children now , now they have a real chance .
The poor are the ones who fill our military .
The poor are the ones who die for their country
WTF are you blathering about ?
In frequent threads here the brain @-@ dead leftists moan about how the "@ idle rich @" ( like there is such a thing ) do n't deserve their money .
But look at the other side .
The poor in this country enjoy a lifestyle envied by even middle class people in most of the world .
What have they done to deserve this ?
The idlest of the idle rich invest money and help other hard working people get ahead .
The poor simply absorb tax payer funding and have babies .
Are you going to make A Modest Proposal on what to do with our poor ?
As it is with most wars in most countries .
What percent of the wealthy are fighting for their country ?
so the left are poor people who have tons of babies in order to soak up other peoples money , but also abort anything they can because they are murders ?
hmmmmm @......
amusing @....
I thought the "@ poor @" was President Obama 's brother living in a hut .
I think Bam Bam did send him an autographed picture which he has not sold on e bay yet .
His aunt a person of interest of I think in the Baltimore area .
I think she gets poverty relief locally and not from him .
For years .
I can n't remember why her deportation to Kenya was stalled .
And his other uncle that was just got a DUI charge .
He 's on the dole too I believe .
Obama 's a champ .
His vision instead of helping any members of his family ( it takes a village ) or to help anyone else is to have a Johnny Depp party at the WH when Obama and Michelle could have fed thousands who need food and water .
What a champ !!
And you go Michelle .

Wow .
Lots of neg reps and personal attacks .
And not one person has answered the question .
If the left is so stuck on taxing the shit out of rich people because they do n't work then why are n't they hep on cutting benefits for poor people who do n't work ?
Contumacious had it right @: they vote .
That 's it .
Precisely .
None .
Most go into the military to defend thier nation on behalf of thier countrymen @...
even to defend RW'er .

What have the poor done to deserve our support ?
Do n't talk to me .

There are some people in between jobs .

FWIW local churches and other benevolent orgs are far better equipped to deal with those situations than the gov't .

As to your rant , during most of Bush 's tenure the UE rate was about 5 % .
Meanwhile there was lots of off shoring going on .
So off shoring does not cause job loss .
Actually for every job exported three more are created domestically .
In the 1980 s you doubtless did not have a cell phone ( few people did ) .
You ached for the time you could get 10 cents a minute for calling .
Today your calls are largely free based on a flat rate and you can make them almost anywhere .
OH , so you are talking about the Welfare Queen that Reagan talked about that did n't really exist .
Are we going to talk about unicorns next ?
Lepruchauns ?
The Unemployment rate is n't that important .
a 5 % unemployment rate where everyone has McJobs is n't an improvement .
I would much rather have the Clinton UE of 3.9 % where you could throw out a resume and get a better paying job in a month that you barely qualified for than the 6.3 % UE of Bush where you could n't get a job you totally qualified for because you were competing against 40 other guys who were just as qualifed .
Offshoring replaced good paying manufacturing jobs with service McJobs .
That was NOT an improvement , guy .
Bloodletting is not a valid medical treatment , either .
We send out 500 billion in wealth every year to other countries , that 's not a good thing .
I am talking about generations of unemployed and unemployable people .
Do n't tell me they do n't exist .
You ought to know better .
Your comparison of the Bush years with the Clinton years is a joke .
But I have effectively refuted your point @: off shoring was going like crazy during hte Bush years and there was more manufacturing going on here and less unemployment .
I am sorry you can not compete against guys more qualified than you .
Night school maybe ?
Clearly we need the poor to have money in their pockets so they can buy our goods and services .
And the rich use them to build their empires .
When did a poor person ever create a job ?
Last time he had money in his pockets .
Before Bush took office .
That 's when .
Now that 's circular thinking .
You answered your own question in your first sentence .
The '@ poor @' create jobs through their spending habits .
Um , no they do n't .
You should ask all the Christian Churches who give millions to the poor in one form or another .
If the poor do not deserve such charity , then Christianity is a religion with a very serious fundamental flaw @...

Allowing corporations and the rich to not pay their fair share certainly is n't the way .
Or lying us into the Iraq war and paying for it with borrowed money .

Is it because our government now works for the corporations instead of the people ?
Citizens United would suggest so .
The GOP are only cutting spending on things that help the poor and middle class .
Drop in the bucket but making America a much worse place than it was before .

Democrats made it law to put this money into the general fund and that SS be made a budget item .
Should I thank you or kick you ?
They broke SS . It was n't broken before they purposely broke it .
And now they want to end it or privatize it ?
How about put it back to what it was before .
Did n't Bush tap into SS to pay for the Bush tax cuts ?
End the Bush tax cuts and first order is to put all that money back into SS where they found it .
Clinton tapped into it too .

There is no material difference to the poor person whether his handout came from a voluntary contribution or as you call it '@ forced @' .
It has the same effect on him , and thus if you believe conservative propaganda , it makes him lazy and dependent .

Government 's job is to protect the freedoms of all citizens so that they can succeed or fail all on their own
Idiot @...
Sorry but we are not a Darwinistic society
Thank god we do n't allow people like yourself to make decisions
Sorry @...

if you do not improve yourself , what you can bring to the table in skills , etc. , it is not up to society or government to make up for it
"@ And they have been paid appropriately for their labors @...@ @"
I think that proably our biggest problem is that that is very rarely true .
It would probably be at least as true to say that those who work the hardest are paid the least .
We are Darwinian no matter who is in charge .
If it 's the Democrats , only those who hew the line on global warming , racism , poverty , etc. etc. will get official permission to continue .
At least with conservatives people can succeed or fail on their own .
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day .
Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime .
Giving someone some old unwanted can of creamed corn rusting in the back of the pantry hardly competes with really giving someone a chance .
The "@ let them die @" crowd does n't get it .
What cold , hard hearts and tiny minds they have .
Would Jesus be proud ?
I doubt it .
Some people are down and out despite their best efforts .
Those are the ones that we seek to help and I 've never heard anyone object to that , on either side .
Liberals see victims everywhere and coddle anyone who might be willing to support them .
Liberal politicians require as many dependents as possible to ensure their power and they are expert at creating government dependents .
The premise seems to be that any person is entitled to everything by virtue of the fact that they were born .
Liberals expect nothing from their dependents other than blind obedience and a vote .
In exchange , the person will receive things for nothing .
I have a huge problem with the growing number of people who seek to scam the system and a government who is reticent to call them up on it .
They see increased applications for welfare as a success .
It means they have more people who are unlikely to bite the hand that feeds them .
We see illegal aliens getting disability checks , along with free housing , food , utilities and medical .
Where is the incentive to work if politicians will support you just for the asking ?
I know there are needy who have no choice , but I also know there are people who have a choice and they have opted to take what they can even though they could do better for themselves if they were so inclined .
Now that more jobs are gone forever , more have no choice but to turn to government .
I believe this is by design .
Able bodied people have soaked the system for years and they no longer have the desire to do for themselves .
I think this was the intent .
Now , those who are hopelessy workshy have increased to the point where they can turn elections in their favor .
We were warned by our forefathers that once the majority of the populace realized that they could vote to have the wealth from others passed to them , it was the beginning of the end for the country .
You bet .
Once the public has learned that they can draw from the public largesse then we are done .
We already have 47 % of the folks in this country who pay no Fed taxes .
What happens when that number reaches 50 % , 55 % or 60 % ?
The takes will outnumber those providing .
Greece anyone ??
If you and every other human on Earth could perform the task @...
you 're not going to be paid as much as you would if you had a specialized skill @...
sorry @..
that 's the way it is and why fry cooks do n't get experienced welder pay
Then would you care to explain why so many people with degrees and other specialized skills are fry cooks and dishwashers ?
If noone needs a welder the special skill will n't make you anything .
Also there are many jobs that require a lot of trining and / or education , are very important to our society , and still do n't pay much .
Which jobs are important , competitive , and do n't pay much ?
If you say math / science teachers , the reason is because of union rules , which forbid paying some area teachers more than others .
Almost every instance of extended shortage is the result of gov't policies .
Ask him what percent of hisself fought for our country .
Those of you who call yourselves Christians need not ask this question if you are a true follower of Christ .
There have been times in the past , perhaps to this day , when some military families qualified for food stamps , and perhaps other government '@ handouts @' .
During Reagan 's terms , I frequently had to help my sailors with families apply for food stamps .
Anyone E-5 or below with spouse and 2 kids minimum qualified .
I remember it shocking me .

“@ If this is going to be a Christian nation that does n’t help the poor , either we have to pretend that Jesus is just as selfish as we are or we ’ve got to acknowledge that he commanded us to love the poor and serve the needy without condition .
And then admit that we just do n’t want to do it . @”
– Stephen Colbert
An interesting thought he makes .
Involuntary charity forced by government to take care of someone else 's personal needs is tantamount to rape , or theft , or whatever other little description work that can be used to show violation
No go play in traffic , you habitual liar
Personally @..
I do n't care about the thoughts of a comedian
And that was certainly a motivator for me to work my way up the career ladder of my profession .
As one who finished the BSN at 41 , I knew I would not really feel like thumping up and down the halls of a hospital for very many years .
But , believe it or not , there are people who really like what they do even though you consider it to be menial .
I know nurses who work the bedside , who have always worked the bedside , and will have to be carried off the job feet first if they ever leave the beside .
People who work at hard labor are fit and healthy and live fairly long lives .
When we were young , before my husband got an easier job , he did manual labor .
He was tan and muscular and looked like a Greek god .
I often wonder if he might have lived longer had he stayed with a more physically demanding job .
I often wonder that about myself , although my arthritis usually answers the question for me .
The big problem with people who have your attitude is that you demean honest forms of work .
If they have made peace with their pay , then there is no reason you should not be at peace with their pay as well .
When I was in the hospital about to die back in August , did I want a psych NP , a clone of myself ?
Oh HELL no !
I wanted a good staff level nurse who knew how to take care of me because I could n't take care of myself .
And I wanted a good nursing assistant who would help me wash my hair , bathe , and feel like a human being again .
They were there .
And ya know what , almost to the person the CNAs were in nursing school and the nurses were in NP school .
For I was hospitalized at Vanderbilt where employees can get their education for free if they contract to work there for a while .
"@ The big problem with people who have your attitude is that you demean honest forms of work . "
On the contrary my purpose in responding to this thread has been to point out that there is nothing shameful in having priorities other than making the maximum possible amount money and that simply having money does not mean you are more intelligent or industrious than anyone else .
By the same token not having a great deal of money does n't mean someone expects , wants or needs some kind of handout .
And it most certainly does NOT follow that a lack money indicates a lazy welfare cheat and / or drug dealer .
"@ I know nurses who work the bedside , who have always worked the bedside , and will have to be carried off the job feet first if they ever leave the beside . @"
That would be me for 40 @+ years ( except for the feet first part ) .
And I could only dream of the pay and benifits a union welder gets .
I have also worked at Vanderbuilt .
The average nurse there impressed me as being more interested in finding a doctor to marry than in their patients .
All thsoe things are fine and dandy , but not what the thread is about .
If someone is n't interested in making the max amt of money he can , fine .
I 'm not .
I have other priorities .
But I 'm not sitting around expecting the state to pay my rent and food bill either .
But lots of people are .
And they are the problem , simply because they cause a demand on other people 's resources .
Vanderbilt ( not Vanderbuilt @--@ I doubt you worked there ) is a teaching hospital .
So nursing care is n't wonderful .
Has anyone else noticed the recent concerted effort by the GOP to paint being poor in America as desirable and good ?
Just another indicator of how out of touch the party is .
negged for being an asshole .
You fuck wads need to separate the poor from people on welfare .
The poor are not thriving in an EU party land .
We work and get by . we ai n't chillin all day tippin back 40 's .
My sore legs and tired back would like you to go fuck yourself .
Hey now , I work and knock back 40 's when I clock out .
It 's amazing the people who push this crap think if you are n't paying taxes to the gov't then no charitable acts wil ever take place .
The truth is that the govt is the least efficient method of distributing anything that might actually help people .
But in general gov't programs increase poverty and dependence .
Which is probably the idea .
The truth is that charities are the least efficient .
On top of exorbitant salaries of some charity CEOs , they have high overhead and are feast or famine depending on contributions
Public charities are a nice stopgap but they are incapable of handling the volume that the government can .
No country on earth relies on public charities to handle all their public welfare
They are actually the most efficient , far more than the gov't , in part because they are there , while the gov't is in Washington .
The more bureaucrats run charities , the mroe people who need them .
The more private sources run charities , the less people need them .
Moral in there somewhere .
May I see the sources for this claim , please ?
Sure , go right ahead .
So you think an active duty member of the military whose family qualifies for food stamps should get a parttime job ( is that even legal ?
! ) so that he makes enough to not be qualified for food stamps ?
You see , this is why I 'm right when I say conservatism is dead .
The only active duty personnel I ever saw in 23 yrs that needed food stamps were the ones that enlisted with a family all ready or got married too young and started a family .
If a man or woman enlists at 18 and waits 3 or 4 years until they are at least E-4 or E-5 when they qualify for military housing , they can raise a family with no problem on military pay .
That depends , an E-4 or an E-5 with a spouse and kids who lives on a base in California or Hawaii would probably qualify for food stamps because the cost of living is so outragreously high in those places , I was stationed at Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara country and everyone who was n't an E-7 or above was struggling like hell to make ends meet , the cash checking places were always packed with enlisted folks on the · 1 st and 15 th when we got paid .
If they live in on base housing , thier rent is covered .
Unfoutantely , most base have limited housing and they go to married E-4 's and above .

Private charities are much more inefficient than government .
Most of their overhead is dedicated just to the act of raising money .
Some charities spend as much as 90 % just in fundraising expenses
What 's the overhead for govt ?
I 'll bet it is much higher than the AVERAGE ( not some horror story ) for charities .
The issue is not which kind of '@ charity @' is most efficient , government or private .
The issue is that government charity creates a class of poor who are never anything but poor , make their beds daily in their own misery , can not see the opportunities that are out there for them in this great country , and have given up their freedom for a type of miserable security that no one would choose without having it foisted upon them .
Any government program or function has high overhead .
What do private charities do to wean people out of poverty ?
Government welfare agencies offer educational support and jobs programs to provide a way out of poverty .
Millions of Americans have taken advantage of these programs
OMG !!!
You are an absolute idiot !!!
Fact is , government overhead is much lower .
Government executives make significantly less than the heads of charities .
Charities have to spend a great deal of their time and effort on just raising money @.....
forget about dispersing it .
Government does not have that problem
"@ But lots of people are .
And they are the problem , simply because they cause a demand on other people 's resources . @"
And that is also fine and dandy but that gives you no right to slander those who make no such demands .
If you would n't demand the taxpayer subsidize your gasoline in every post I might take you seriously .

We need fewer people on welfare , not more .
Well no shit .
Why do n't you propose just how it is that these welfare recipients are going to get that working poor job .
Where are the Repubcon "@ job creators @" .
I mean , what could be better than employing a person with no skills and no education ?
You only have to pay them minimum wage .
Someoen with no skills is n't worth minimum wage .
That 's why they 're unemployed .
Reduce min wage and we can see some job growth .
And as people develop skills from their starter job they will earn more .
Now we can see why you are such a rocket scientist
Just what we need to help people escape poverty @....
slashing wages and benefits
So Rabbi @...
according to your economic model .
If you are paying some guy minimum wage to sweep your floors , if you slash minimum wage you will now hire two guys to sweep your floors
Again .
When you get that minimum wage job with no benes , how long are they going to keep it ?
When you can n't pay for child care , how long are you going to work .
If you get sick and fired for missing work , oh well .
From the discussions I read on here , people would think it is easy to be poor .
They have big screens , but they bought them from a person that sells stolen goods .
They have a cell phone .
Whoop t do .
How they gonna conduct their "@ bidness @" without a cell phone ?
So they have medical issues .
That is what 911 calls are for .
And hospital emergency rooms .
Much easier to be rich .
As long as you do n't want to tax them more .
Then it is really REALLY hard to defend your money .
But it is much easier if you have poor people to blame for not paying taxes .
Then rich people can say that if poor people do n't pay income taxes then why should they pay even more income taxes .
Does n't make any difference if the fact poor people pay no income tax is the result of the tax writing policies put in place by the Repubcons so the stupid Dems would go along with the tax package that lowered the tax rates on the wealthy .
It is the poor persons fault .
Poor people have really sucky lobbyists .
Aww poor people .
It 's just really tough .
Much easier to sit back and get dat gummint check .
Let 's make it easy for everyone .
Hey , let 's just send everyone a gummint check every month and no one will have child care worries or problems paying rent .
You really have to wonder why he has n't left in shame .
I hope you mean Nutwinger .
I guess it never occurred to him that if you expect people to work their way up you need to have somewhere they can start .
With a high min wage it cuts out lots of starting jobs , like theater ushers and the like , that teenagers typically got back in the 50 s , 60 s etc. Now there is hardly any way a teenager can get job experience so they are more employable .
We raised the min wage and teenaged unemployment went through the roof .
And the Dems want it even higher .

Many restaurant workers do not make minimum wage .
They depend on tips .
If they need a theater usher they will hire one at minimum wage .
Fact is , they do n't need them .
Jobs are determined by the work that needs to be accomplished .
Cutting the minimum wage does not mean you have more work
Raising the minimum wage is why we no longer have theater ushers , or gas station attendants .
We got self serve gas stations when the minimum wage made it cost effective .
We used to have a LOT of entry level jobs for kids that the minimum wage got rid of .

We still have "@ Paper boys @" they drive cars though .

we have a real unemployment number ( including those that gave up ) of 12 @-@ 15 % .
So at the high end @...
that 's 60 million people @....
let 's break that down , shall we ?
How many are disabled ?
How many are just temporarily receiving benefits ?
How many are REALLY working the system ?
I do n't know .
ANd it does n't matter .
What matters is we have a very large number of people who think a gov't check is a reasonable alternative to finding work .
And our system has fostered that belief .
We need to reform the system ( not just welfare ) to make it possible fr people to enter the workforce and stay there and advance .
One needs that capacity to begin with .
Sociopathic personalities do n't .
I happen to agree with Rabbi
Welfare needs to provide two things .
A safety net and a path out .
While conservatives rant about how the safety net allows the poor to live in the lap of luxury with flat screen TVs , microwave ovens and cell phones , most poor live in bad neighborhoods with bad schools and few job prospects
As to a path out @....
that 's where it gets tricky .
We need to provide good schools , jobs related training , low cost childcare and jobs programs that not only provide a foot in the door but some type of career path
Most importantly , the poor need to do more to help themselves .
Low marriage rates , fractured family structures , teenaged pregnancy all help to ensure they do not escape poverty
And poverty programs all support and reward exactly those things you correctly identify as keeping people in poverty .
Maybe htis is a breakthrough .
The other day ( March 1 ) Senator Olympia Snowe wrote a piece in the WaPo detailing why she 's quiting .
Sounds a lot like what Evan Bayh said a couple of years ago .
Putting aside whatever you might think of either person , the issue of the Senate 's total inability to cooperate with each other is badly damaging the country .
Quite frankly , I do n't know if it 'll make much difference who wins the WH or who wins the Senate majority this November .
I do n't see either party winning 60 seats , so it 's going to come down to bipartisanship if anything significant is to be done .
And we got some significant things that need doing .
I think Obama 's partisan politics and rhetoric make him unable or maybe even unwilling to actually cooperate and compromise .
If he 's elected , I do n't see him accepting anything less than his way on everything important .
The same for Harry Reid , if a repub wins the WH but the Dems keep their majority in the Senate .
Maybe I 'm wrong , maybe that 's unfair , but these guys appear to be soley interested in party politics above what 's really best for the country .
And I can n't say the GOP would be any different if they get in . Even if they did win the WH and both Houses of Congress , they 're not going to have a filibuster proof Senate , and that means working together with the Dems .
In my view , the Dems had their shot and blew it ; it 's time to give the repubs their chance , with the understanding that we need to see some action on the things that matter most .
snippet @:
One difficulty in making the Senate work the way it was intended is that America ’s electorate is increasingly divided into red and blue states , with lawmakers representing just one color or the other .
Before the 1994 election , 34 senators came from states that voted for a presidential nominee of the opposing party .
That number has dropped to just 25 senators in 2012 .
The result is that there is no practical incentive for 75 percent of the senators to work across party lines .
The great challenge is to create a system that gives our elected officials reasons to look past their differences and find common ground if their initial party positions fail to garner sufficient support .
In a politically diverse nation , only by finding that common ground can we achieve results for the common good .
That is not happening today and , frankly , I do not see it happening in the near future .
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/olympia-snowe-why-im-leaving-the-senate/2012/03/01/gIQApGYZlR_story.html"> Olympia Snowe @: Why Irsquom leaving the Senate - The Washington Post </a>
Something significant being done is exactly what many are opposed to , and wish to maintain the stalemate .
The same for Harry Reid if a repub wins the WH but the Dems keep their majority in the Senate .
Maybe I 'm wrong , maybe that 's unfair , but these guys are soley interested in party politics above what 's really best for the country .
Boehner and McConnell have equally engaged in partisan politics and rhetoric making both unwilling to actually cooperate and compromise ; indeed , McConnell made clear the Senate Minority ’s one goal was to ‘@ get rid of Obama . @’ To blame only Obama and Reid for ‘@ playing politics @’ is blind and partisan on your part .
And I can n't say the GOP would be any different if they get it .
Even if they did win the WH and both Houses of Congress , they 're not going to have a filibuster proof Senate , and that means working together with the Dems .
Give the GOP a chance to do what , exactly ?
They had their chance between 2001 and 2007 , resulting in two failed , illegal wars , a deficit , and bigger government .
Some might go so far as to say GOP policies resulted in the December 2007 recession ; I will n’t make that claim but it ’s certainly damning evidence .
If this was supposed to be a ‘@ plague on both houses @’ thread , it ’s a major fail .
Compromise is a dirty word to most of the right who actually destroy their own for engaging in such treason to the ideology and you are going to complain that democrats refuse to cooperate ?
Knuckle under to threats and cave @-@ in to pressure you mean ?
Democrats have compromised on plenty , they are just not going to assist republicans in their mission to dump the poor and the old any further , republicans are going to have to finish that one by themselves .
Well , you can n't pass a Health Care Bill , in the middle of the night , against the majority of the nation , with little or no input of the other side and expect lines not to be draw @-@ en .
Horseshit .
On so many levels .
One , the bill was "@ against the majority of the nation @" only when you combine those who were against any comprehensive health care reform with those who thought the bill was n't nearly liberal enough .
Two , the only reason there was little or no input from the other side is because the other side refused to offer any beyond "@ kill the bill . @"
Three , in spite of the fact that Democrats passed the bill by themselves , it is still from start to finish a Republican bill , lacking every feature that progressives might have preferred ( e.g. a public option ) , and the only reason Republicans opposed it is because they would politically committed to oppose anything and everything .
The Majority is the Majority no matter what .
Even under President Clinton when the majority was against that health care bill , it was respected and not passed .
Because the majority did not want it .
It was n't forced like this one was .
You did n't watch the committee meetings did you ?
The majority of Dems killed almost every single bill brought up by Republicans .
So their bills did not even get to the floor for a vote at all .
This Health Care Bill is a Democratic Bill all the way , through and through .
They own it , it is their baby .
HillaryCare was just put on the back @-@ burner @...
for another day @...
But what we have is worse @...
What I 'm saying is that there was no majority .
A minority of the people wanted a more progressive approach to health @-@ care reform .
A minority liked the ACA as written .
A minority were philosophically opposed to any significant government involvement .
The only way you get a majority is to improperly and deceptively combine the third group with the first one .
That is , not to put it too strongly , bullshit .
The majority of Dems killed almost every single bill brought up by Republicans
I watched some of them , and read about the GOP proposed amendments afterwards .
The Republicans knew their amendments would be killed , and intended that they be killed .
Those amendments existed only to slow the process down .
None of them were serious attempts to improve the bill .
Funny how even a relatively sane and rational Republican like Wiseacre sees Obama as a hard @-@ line , inflexible partisan , while to us on the left he comes across as a totally unsatisfactory limp noodle without a vertebra to his name .
Clearly , Snowe 's reasoning does n't apply to the president ( regardless of party ) since he is elected by all of the states .
What would you call a President who deliberately called conservatives '@ the enemy @' ?
There is no clearer '@ partisan @' than your messiah .
I do n't have a "@ messiah , @" and if I did he certainly would n't be Obama , and I do n't recall him calling conservatives "@ the enemy , @" and would appreciate a link or citation of him doing so .
In context , please .
No @...
he called the '@ private sector @' businesses "@ the enemy @" .
He has stayed true to his writings .

Here 's an interesting take on how turnout is shaping up in this primary season , by demographic , and what that implies for the GOP this year .
<a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/the-electoral-wasteland/"> The Electoral Wasteland - NYTimes.com </a>
In barely a century ’s time , the population of the United States has more than tripled , to 313 million .
We are a clattering , opinionated cluster of nearly all the world ’s races and religions , and many of its languages , under one flag .
You would not know any of this looking at who is voting in one of the strangest presidential primary campaigns in history .
There is no other way to put this without resorting to demographic bluntness @: the small fraction of Americans who are trying to pick the Republican nominee are old , white , uniformly Christian and unrepresentative of the nation at large .
None of that is a surprise .
But when you look at the numbers , it ’s stunning how little this Republican primary electorate resembles the rest of the United States .
They are much closer to the population of 1890 than of 2012 @....
So far , three million voters have participated in the Republican races , less than the population of Connecticut .
This means that 89 percent of all registered voters in those states have not participated in what is , from a horse @-@ race perspective , a very tight contest .
Yes , we know Republicans do n’t like their choices ; it ’s a meh primary .
But still , in some states , this election could be happening in a ghost town .
Less than 1 percent of registered voters turned out for Maine ’s caucus .
In Nevada , where Republican turnout was down 25 percent from 2008 , only 3 percent of total registered voters participated @....
South Carolina is the major outlier this year , the only state to show a big increase in turnout , up 35 percent from 2008 .
But when you look at who voted , you see a very specific niche .
In the Palmetto State , 98 percent of primary voters were white , 72 percent were age 45 or older and nearly two @-@ thirds were evangelical Christian , according to exit polls .
From this picture , you may think South Carolina is an all @-@ white , aging state , full of fervent churchgoers .
But the Census says the state is only 66 percent white , with a median age of 36 .
Exit polls from 2008 put the evangelical vote at 40 percent of total @....
Outside of Florida , this contest has been nearly an all @-@ white affair .
Nevada is 26 percent Latino by population ; in the primary , only 5 percent were Latino .
Caucus voters in Iowa were 99 percent white .
Again , these numbers represent a small echo chamber .
Whites are 63.7 percent of the total population of the United States ; in 1900 , they were 88 percent — still more diverse than Republican primary voters today .
The takeaway point of this poorly attended , unrepresentative Republican primary contest is not to focus entirely on who is voting but on why the candidates are taking such fringe positions .
One explains the other .
Thus , the New York Times poll of this week found that all voters , by a 66 to 26 ratio , support the federal requirement that private health care plans cover the full cost of birth control for female patients .
Among women , support is 72 @-@ 20 .
And with Catholics , it ’s 67 @-@ 25 .
Yes , Catholics are slightly more liberal than the population at large .
Other polls show a huge majority of Americans want to raise taxes on the rich , favor the planned withdrawal from Afghanistan and believe the earth is warming because of human action .
Yet the Republican front @-@ runner of the moment , Rick Santorum , is with the minority on each of these issues , and Mitt Romney is a near match .
So , given how out of sync these two candidate are with the rest of the country , how could they be the front @-@ runners ?
It ’s simple @: Look at who is voting , a nation unto itself .
Now I predict that the usual suspects , if they reply at all , will dismiss this as the views of a liberal columnist and so avoid dealing with the hard facts he presents .
As long as that head @-@ in @-@ the @-@ sand tendency persists , so will the problem .
Wonderful @: the Toddster and the JoeB arguing with each other .
a crazy comedy duo , those two
I can still smack you around if you 'd like .
You end up face down butt in the air as you always do .
But @...
go ahead if you need the attention , and I will call The T in for you .
It goes back to Romney ( care ) when Santorum eventually ends his "@ flavor of the week @" stint .
It ’s always been Romney .
And the problem with Romney is n’t that he ’s not ‘@ conservative enough , @’ whatever that means .
The problem with Romney is he ’s weak , indecisive , and inconsistent .
Had Romney been a consistent liberal over the years – his true designation – conservatives might not agree with him but they ’d have no choice but to respect him .
Currently the right affords him neither support nor respect .
True on both counts .
Still projecting I see .
If there is an American that does not indirectly employ a boat load of illegal immigrants here and Chinks over there then let me be the first to shake his hand .
Really has nothing to do with what I said , but let 's look at that .
The people who control commerce have made the decision that the middle class made too much money back in the 1980 's and they did n't have enough to buy all the Polo Ponies they wanted .
So they insisted on free trade with countries like China that chop up their own citizens for transplant organs .
And they insisted on "@ right to work @" laws that busted up the unions .
And they insisted on lax immigration laws .
Now , I agree , it would be nice if we all employed a bit of common sense and spent the few extra pennies to only buy what is made here .
It would be better if we refocused our illegal immigration efforts off the poor immigrants and onto the rich assholes who pay them under the table so they will n't have to pay an American a fair wage .
And this is where "@ conservatives @" like you and Romney have really messed it up .
In your effort to get rid of the middle class and unions , you 've made people more dependent on government , and therefore , more likely to vote for more of it .
Anyone that has a nickel in their pocket has a part in controlling commerce .
Everyone should have a right to work .
Forcing folk to join a union to be able to work is as unAmerican as it gets .
Why should I have to pay a union boss that works 8 hours a month 100 K a year to be able to work ?
You should n't - if you would have the same wages and benefits without the union .
Unions are for those that do not have the skills and education to be able to negotiate their own wages in a free market .
Underachievingt lazy Americans need unions .
Hard working skilled professionals never need a union .
They can negotiate their own contract without having to carry the fat , lazy , uneducated , low skilled and dependent union worker .
Unions are for those that have no other skill other than a 5 th grade educated worker has with a hammer in their hand .
Tell that to the construction crafts and trades skilled labor folks .
we all knew that Santorums biggest set back was the fact that he does n't come off as presidential , but he does have one vital thing going for him,,he is very likable and the GOP and Conservative base will settle for him much more than Romney .
then again , Obama was never presidential , if anything , a stuttering senator with no personality and needed cue cards just to speak to an audience .
LOL .
You must also think leprosy and smallpox are very likable .
No , we do n't know that .
People like get involved and I are still fighting to MAKE it happen .
What illegal immigration has done to the workforce is criminal , and needs to be addressed .
As long as there are people willing to stand up for what is right , there is a chance that we can get something done .
Why not make them legal ?
Give them migrant work Visas .
Allow them to work , pay taxes , stop hiding .
Allow them to go home when they want and come back to work .
Allow them to apply for citizenship and get credit for the time they have been here
ok @....
are they also going to have to pay a sum of cash for the back taxes they did not pay ? @....
How would you determine what they owe ?
There 's no records of stolen social security numbers @...
No
Because given the chance they would have gladly accepted a fair wage and paid a tax on it
If anything , those who employed them should have to pay back taxes
Workers who worked under a fake SSN paid taxes and received no credit
The problem with most of you liberals is that you never know what the fuck you 're talking about .
I 've been saying throughout this thread that the criminal employers need to be prosecuted .
It 's Obama and Bush before him that will n't follow the damned LAW .
I 've been in the construction trades most of my adult life and I 'd be HAPPY to start working those jobs again .
My only problem is that I 'm an American who is expected to pay his bills and his taxes , which is impossible to do on the current wages paid for those construction jobs .
You see , I 've got responsibilities to my family like college for my kid , insurance for my car , payments to the doctor , etc. , etc. @...
I can n't live 8 people in a 2 bedroom house , I can n't use the ER as a clinic , I can n't give a false or stolen Social Security number and avoid paying taxes .
And just for the record moron , it 's got nothing to do with skin color .
That racist canard is old , tired and wrong .
No , of course it is n't .
I always am amazed how you think these illegals are all lving large on your dime .
I know a lot of people in the trades , and they are doing fine .
Of course , no one is building houses right now because we already have more than the market can sell , but blame the illegals for your woes @...
I 'm always kind of amused that you guys want to fire all the government workers because they are making too much money , but you have a fit when someone undercuts your salary .
Bullshit !
They claimed '@ Exempt @' and paid NOTHING !
Why worry about it , when the wages get reported to the IRS they go after the REAL owner of that SS number !
The Republicans want cheap labor for business .
The Democrats want total inclusion for all people .
Neither party wants to change anything .
But seriously .
Study globalization .
The point is to replace expensive American labor with cheap Chinese labor or abominably cheap 3 rd world labor .
Research the relationship of one America 's largest businesses , Walmart , with China .
Walmart bypassed America 's more expensive labor markets for profits .
They care about profits over patriotism .
This is what Republican do n't understand about the free market @: capital does n't care about American labor .
Capital does n't care about Borders , Language , Culture ; rather , it cares about maximizing profit .
If it has to sell American labor down river , it will .
The story of the loss of American jobs is the story of capital 's thirst for cheap labor .
The story of open borders is partly the story of how capital requires open borders in order to get the cheapest labor wherever and however it can find it .
The average Republican voter does n't get it .
When your party was taken over by market fundamentalism , it became an accomplice of open borders and American job loss , both of which are contrary to the fake brand of "@ patriotism @" , which is merely a narcotic fed to idiots .
Republican voters are urged to read two great conservative authors .
1 . Daniel Bell 's "@ The Cultural Contradiction of Capitalism @" .
This is about the contradiction between the market 's desire for open borders and the conservative 's desire for cultural homogeneity .
2 . Christopher Lasch 's "@ The culture of Narcissism @" .
This is about how the liberal New Deal , through its protection of high wages and American jobs , unwittingly created the conservative heyday of the 50 's .
How did this happen ?
Answer @: high wages allowed the mother to stay at home and raise the kids .
After Reagan crushed high wages in America ( which was done as a gift to big business ) , the mother was forced into the workplace .
This meant kids were raised not by the Family , but MTV or worse , gangs .
Republican voters who have never studied these issues in a rigorous academic context do n't get it .
When Reagan re @-@ designed the party to serve the interests of capital , he did damage to many conservative causes .
The GOP covers up the contradiction Reagan set in motion through the use of patriotic and religious rhetoric , and through the empty rhetoric of freedom .
They suppress the contradiction between Capital and Conservatism .
Here is the sad part @: many posters on this board do n't see the ruse .
They trust Republican Government deeply .
They are the true Useful Idiots of government .
Until they wake up and get rid of the current GOP leadership , they will unwittingly be the dupes of those anti @-@ patriotic forces which destroy American jobs in the service if Capital .
I agree with you wholeheartedly !
I 've said it before , BOTH parties are fucking American workers .
Corporatists and Progressives , hand in hand @...
Clinton is worse than Reagan .
See NAFTA , which destroyed American labor .
The old FDR Liberals and Isolationist Conservatives protected the American worker .
Those days are gone .
America needs a 3 rd political party which is not controlled by Capital 's need for sweatshop labor .
I remember NAFTA @...
I voted for Ross Perot in '@ 92 @...
a lot of these problems can be solved if people would just buy only american made products .
but i guarantee that people will bitch and moan that its 20 % more expensive and go right back to the cheap imports .
That 's probably going to depend on whether 30 million illegals get amnesty or not .
I know you Dems are looking to get that great big voting block , but I do n't think it 's going to happen .
If there were 30 million illegals here , that would be ten percent of our population , dipshit .
It 's hard to even FIND American @-@ made products any more @...
No kidding , dipshit .
I know what the numbers are , I posted my reasons for posting that number several pages back .
If you want to dispute them , address them and tell me why they 're wrong .
agreed .
because people will buy the cheap imports , which eventually forced most of the US manufacturers to close up shop because they could n't compete .

He has the right to veto legislation he does n't find appropriate .
Federal judges do n't appear to take kindy with voting on this issue .
No , what the federal judges had a problem with was that California had granted recognition to gay marriage and then took it away .
It was a very narrowly defined ruling .
With Christie 's veto , New Jersey has not granted recognition .
that was n't the basis for the decision .
Christie Vetoes Gay Marriage
Actually I think government belongs out of marriage .
I agree that marriage is between a man and a woman but that can conly be sanctified by God .
Render unto Ceasar what is Ceasar 's .
In this case I think that is beyond Ceasar 's bounds .
tell the irs
I 'm in a lazy mood right now , so do n't want to sift through the actual ruling , but here is a small snippet from the NYTimes @:
In California , a court battle continued .
The state ’s Supreme Court had ruled in May 2008 that a ban on same-sex marriage was discriminatory , and the state began performing them .
The ban was restored in a referendum that fall by a ballot measure known as Proposition 8 .
The legality of the Proposition 8 ban was upheld by the state ’s Supreme Court , but in August 2011 , a federal judge ruled that it was unconstitutional .
In February 2012 , a federal appeals court agreed .
The case is expected to be resolved by the Supreme Court .

Where did they say that ?
In their decision .
Do you have some link to the section where it talks about it ?
I do n't recall that being a basis for their ruling .
I have the decision @:

I 'm telling the whole world or at least the subset that is on US Message boards right now .
They can like it or lump it .
It matters little to me .
After all , , , , I 'm just giving my "@ Thoughts ? @"
Yes , it was .
There is nothing stopping gays from marrying .
Nothing .
Christie did not just veto their ability to marry .
The only thing that separates a gay marriage from a straight marriage is the government cash and prizes that come with marriage .
That is what Christie vetoed .
And that is what makes gay marriage a 14 th amendment issue .
See my signature .
That 's not why I got married .
I got married because I loved my wife and wanted our relationship validated
Same as gays
And many gays have marriage ceremonies in states that do not recognize them .
Just as I 'm sure people in interracial marriages did before they were legal .
Should we have kept interracial marriages illegal since marriage is supposed to be about love ?
Understand the problem ?
There is no problem .
The governor vetoed a a bill .
It happens every day .
Find someone else 's crotch to cry on .
After all , , , , I 'm just giving my " Thoughts ? @"
surely you speak euphemistically
It does n't seem to be the crux of the decision , imo .
tell the irs
Although it seemed to take awhile , you are catching on .
I think you are correct , FactFinder .
Marriage is a religious institution , the state should only be ruling on civil unions .
This ruling takes away the dignity and status of religious peoples .
then they must not have had much to begin with
As compared to gays and lesbians ?
I agree .
Anyone who has to suck the teat of government to establish they are right probably are in a big stretch .
as compared to anyone .
Well @...
think on it for awhile .
It really is not that difficult .
Interesting when you consider all the important times in life seem to invite a religious element .
Most Americans believe in God .
Yet , no dignity , hmmm .
<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2012/02/17/dick-cheney-lobbying-for-gay-marriage.html"> Dick Cheney Lobbying for Gay Marriage - The Daily Beast </a>
Dick Cheney , the former U.S. vice president known for his hard right stance on almost all matters political , is taking a stand in Maryland for gay marriage .
Cheney , whose daughter is openly gay , has been lobbying Maryland lawmakers as they debate whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage in the state .
Cheney believes states should legalize gay marriage individually .
Cheney is for gay marriage ?
Holy shit !
Maybe the world IS going to end in 2012 !!!
Cheney 's daughter is gay .
why would i bother ?
Animals eat their own shit too .
Any partakers ?
"@ I am adhering to what I 've said since this bill was first introduced — an issue of this magnitude and importance , which requires a constitutional amendment , should be left to the people of New Jersey to decide , @"

I 've always been a critic of judges who decide they are going to disregard the will of legistlatures and the populace and impose these things , but here 's a case where they did it the right way , they passed a bill , and Christie the Hutt decides he 's stull sucking up to be RomBot 's running mate .
The governor wants voters to decide yet polls show that a majority of N.J. voters favor same sex marriage .
This veto is a political statement from a governor who needs Tea Party support to move into national politics .
His veto simply delays the inevitable .

In their decision .
The two judges on Tuesday stated explicitly that they were not deciding whether there was a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry , instead ruling that the disparate treatment of married couples and domestic partners since the passage of Proposition 8 violated the Constitution ’s Equal Protection Clause .
“@ Although the Constitution permits communities to enact most laws they believe to be desirable , it requires that there be at least a legitimate reason for the passage of a law that treats different classes of people differently , @” Judge Stephen R. Reinhardt wrote in the decision .
“@ There was no such reason that Proposition 8 could have been enacted . @”
“@ All that Proposition 8 accomplished was to take away from same-sex couples the right to be granted marriage licenses and thus legally to use the designation ‘@ marriage , @’ ” the judge wrote , adding , “@ Proposition 8 serves no purpose , and has no effect , other than to lessen the status and human dignity of gay men and lesbians in California . @” · In his dissenting opinion , Judge N. Randy Smith wrote that the court was overreaching in nullifying a voter initiative .
The flaw here is that the government can not demand equal protection to a religious institution .
If they had applied that to civil unions , they would be correct .
The flaw in your statement is that "@ marriage @" is not a religious institution ( as on only a religious institution ) .
"@ Marriage @" in our society exists in two distinct and separate realms @: Religious Marriage and Civil Marriage .
Religious Marriage @: Those marriages established as a function of a religious organization .
There are some religious organizations that recognize same-sex marriages , there are others that do not .
There are religious organizations that do n't recognize valid Civil Marriages also if the Civil Marriage occurs outside the dogma of the specific religious organization .
Civil Marriage @: Civil Marriages are established under the rules and authority of civil government .
Individuals can be married by a religious organization , but if they do n't follow civil law , then , as it pertains to Civil Marriage - those religious marriages are not recognized for governmental purposes .
A couple can be "@ married @" in a Church / Temple / Synagogue , but if they do n't obtain the requisite paperwork from the State that marriage is not valid under Civil Law .
As soon as "@ marriage @" was written into secular law , it was no longer simply a religious institution , it because a separate civil institution also .
If it were only a religious institution , then the government would need to recognize all religious institutions of "@ marriage @" equally - such as Same-sex Marriages performed by religious institutions .
As you pointed out they are not the same thing .
Blurring the line further is not protecting religious rights .
It makes for a clearer case to reverse the appelate decision .
And yet another reason to get government out of marriage except for governmental matters of taxes , inheritance , and power of attorney for emergencies and medical decisions @....
Again @..
all a ploy for forced acceptance and government interference on one side @..
and on the other side , not wanting to reduce government 's scope
power of attorney can be handled locally .
Inheritance is a right .
Government should have diddly to do with it .
Taxes should be simplified so that marriage or family relationships are null and void , a non sequitor item .
reality is n't just a show on tv , you know .
Oh , government dictates reality ?
what color is the sky on your home planet ?
you can say should be this and should be that , but it ai n't gonna happen because you say it , fuckwit
Oh you mean self centered people seeking their selfish ways have to have some power dictating to them what they can and can not do ?
Same sex marriage is illogical overall .
Government should stay out of any discourse on same .
It should be a state level issue and right , in whatever outcome may come .
There are three mitigating issues that brought down all the great civilizations of the past , without exception @: They are @:
untendable debt · expansionism through endless warring · tolerance of all things sexual .
Robert
I disagree .
States must be involve in marriage if we are to have marriage licenses .
Although marriages licenses have been used to prevent child marriages , bigamy , interracial marriages , same sex marriage , and transmission of disease , the primary purpose today is to legally document the marriage for tax purpose and many other legal actions .
The lack of legal documentation of marriage , would cause a multitude of problems .
and we need all that for what ?
If you want to file a joint return , have your IRA passed on to your spouse without the tax burden , have legal recognition as family , and lots of other stuff you need a document accepted by the government as proof of marriage .
Robert
I assert that all government should refrain from all issues pertaining to marriage .
Marriage is between man / woman and God .
Period .
Correct .
Those are all government rules .
I state .
Abolish them all .
I take it you do n't think the government should protect the religious rights of religious institutions who perform same-sex marriages by recognizing them equally ?
The decision has based on Civil Marriage being a secular institution and has nothing to do with recognition or non @-@ recognition of one religious institutions view of what marriage is - it is irrelevant to the question under the secular law .
If the decision were based on the recognition of religious marriage performed by religious institutions - then that would actually be an argument for striking down Prop 8 and the recognition of different religious ceremonies equally .
come back when the meth wears off
Um , yeah , I usually do when people appeal to bigotry to advance their political careers .

Pretty pathetic but also basic to the GObP / pub party who do n't want to create jobs but DO want to control other people 's private lives .
marriage is a creation of the state @...
not religion .
it is mostly a function of property rights as there are over 1,000 rights and obligations which attach themselves to the status of being married .
"@ by the power vested in me by the state of _______________ @"
you can n't possibly be saying that people married in nonreligious ceremonies are n't as married as people married in religious ceremonies .
oh , i bet he can
i truly hope not .
Here are a couple of examples of "@ marriage @" in Civil Law , abolish Civil Marriage and here would be no recognition under the law @: · 1 . There would be no transfer of property to a spouse ( since there would be no such thing as "@ spouse @" under the law .
As such the surviving spouse would be subject to a tax liability upon the transfer of property between people not recognized as legally married .
2 . It would eliminate the exemption form the Estate Tax applicable to the sale of a primary home , only Civil Marriage does that .
( When a home is sold a single person can claim up to $ 250,000 in an exemption , $ 500,000 for a Civilly Married couple .
When one spouse dies the surviving spouse can still claim the married exemption for up to two years after the death if the home is sold .
No spouse , no exemption - the survivor is taxed like a single person . )
3 . No spousal privilege in the case of a criminal prosecution .
4 . Since there would be no "@ spouse @" , they could not be buried in a National Cemetery next to a spouse who was an honorably serving veteran of the United States .
5 . Without the legal recognition of "@ spouse @" there would not be automatic conveyance of parenthood upon the birth of a child .
6 . Since there would be no spouse , there would be no establish family relationship recognized under the Family Medical Leave Act so that a person can care for their spouse ( or be cared for by them ) in times of medical emergency .
7 . Since there would be no "@ spouse @" , employees would become liable for employer portions of health insurance because there would be no waiving of the tax penalty for employer provided health insurance for a spouse .
( For Civily Married couples , the employer portion of Health Insurance is tax free , however on plans where the significant other is not a legal spouse - then the federal government charges that portion as income and is liable for taxation . )
8 .
No "@ spouse @" means no family relationship under Social Security whereby the surviving spouse can receive benefits at the working spouses rate if higher then their own .
9 . No "@ spouse @" means no established a family relationship where a spouse can then sponsor their spouse for immigration purposes .
and to just round it out to 10 @...
10 .
No "@ spouse @" means that military members will not be able to draw pay and benefits for dependent spouses @: no housing allowance , no medical benefits for the spouse , no accompanied tours where the government provides for travel expenses of the spouse , etc. @..
If there is no Civil Marriage , there is no recognition , and so those things all disappear .
Those are a few things that will happen if the government stops recognizing Civil Marriage off the top of my head .
I 'm sure that idea will win great support amongst the populous .
These are all F'n government rules .
I say abolish them all .
If I want to transfer property to my goldfish so be it .
The government did n't have any thing to do with it .
government should have nothing to do with inheritance rights ?
really ?
damn @...
and to think every state has trusts and estates laws governing how estates are handled .
these issues have always been dealt with by government .
rights of dower , courtesy , inheritance ,
you claim not to want government interference , yet you 're ok with government interfering in the relationship between two people .
and it 's ok for government to tell me i can n't purchase birth control ?
i think you might want to work on consistency .
Take away Social Security from the elderly , take away inheritance without tax exemptions , take away home sales without taxing profit , take away money from military families and the ability to have a spouse moved when transferred on orders , take away job protected leave to care for a sick family member @...
You should run for office , I can see that as a winning platform .
I am not OK with government interfering in marriage .
I thought I made that abundantly clear .
Marriage is between the individual and God .
Government can not and should not attempt to legislate it .
As they should stay out of inheritance and all things marriage related .
I trust that my family members would beat the hell out of anyone who tried to take away any property of mine that belonged ot my wife when I leave .
If we both left at the same time then survival of the fittest suits me fine .
As long as who is left does n't defile common law rules against violence ( the proper place for government ) then all is well .
In other words .
I am a family because I state I am a family .
The government should have zero interference in that .
Their tax laws , interference in my retirement plans or lack thereof should be abolished .
It is none of their business and the only reason they have ever ascerted themselves into it was to find out what they could take .
So if marriage is between the individual and God .
Then you would have no problem with the government recognizing as equal all religious marriages between individuals and God based on their individual religious organizations view on the subject correct ?
That if a same-sex couple is married in a religious institution in accordance with their view of what God allows , that those marriages ( which exist today ) should be recognized equally with other religious marriages ?
Or should the government which can not respect one religion over another under the 1 st Amendment , be picking and choosing which religious views are valid .
If the government is to be consistent , then it needs to recognize both , if the government can pick and choose then the governemnt is free to ignore Church doctrine and require Catholic organization to cover birth control under insurance .
Either government has to honor religioius doctrine or it does n't - pick one .
( Personally , I do n't have a conflict because their is no one "@ marriage @" and Religious Marriage is separate from Civil Marriage . )
I do n't think the government need to recognize anything as pertains to marriage .
It is none of their business .
You know me Jill @....
I respect the freedom for anyone to choose to be with whomever they choose in an adult relationship @...
and I respect the freedom for you to purchase any birth control you want @..

If we get the hell out of everybody 's private business we willl be the better for it .
Private is between me and God .
Social Security has nothing to do with marriage .
Actually Social Security does have something to do with marriage in the way it ( SS ) is administered .
Under the law , if a couple is Civilly Married for a prescribed number of years and one or both have been working adults and paid into Social Security , then upon retirement age if one of the spouses had died then the surviving spouse can draw Social Security based on the deceased spouses contribution if it is higher than their own in recognition of the family support entailed in Civil Marriage .
They did for my parents when one passed a number of years before the other .
Whether inheretance taxes should exist or not is a discussion for another thread .
The reality is that they do exist and Civil Marriage brings with it large impacts on the transfer of property between spouses .
The military recognizes the family relationship established as a result of Civil Marriage and with it awards certain benefits as a result .
One such benefit is a military member who has a spouse is eligible for either base housing or additional pay to help provide a place to live for that spouse .
Another is that the spouse becomes eligible for health care under the military system and can use TRICARE for civil health care or can be seen at military clinics and hospitals .
Another is that when the government orders a military member through Permanent Change of Station orders ( PCS ) to relocate from one place to another the military sponsors the spouse to travel and relocate to the new base with their spouse .
For example when I was transferred from Tennesseee to Japan for 4 @-@ years the military paid for my spouse to accompany me and provided United States government sponsorship for my wife to enter and reside in Japan in accordance with the Status of Forces agreement between our two countries .
I agree when we in the military are willing to lay down our lives to defend our country , that when we are in a Civil Marriage all military members should be treated equally .
The same goes for private employers and taking care of their own .
I disagree , it is not the same with private employers .
The military is not the same as a private employer , they are a government employer .
Well that is a different argument in a different place but "@ fair is fair @" .
If not get the hell out of there .
That has a lot to do with why I did n't reup after my 1 st 3 years .
I wanted to be free to tell someone to go to hell .
I do n't understand how this responds to the specific points address about Social Security having nothing to do with marriage and about how Civil Marriage impacts military families .
I can respect your right to believe that .
I just do n't think that once people think beyond the platitude of it and start to examine closely what it means in terms of the 1138 Federal government laws ( at last count ) , plus hundreds of more state laws , in which marriage was a component of federal and state recognized "@ rights , responsibilities , and privileges @" and that if suddenly the government stopped recognizing the family relationship established under Civil Marriage and all that that would take away from the people .
The government stopping the recognition of a spouse will have a huge impact - one that I do n't see you gaining a lot of support from heterosexuals for .
They say the hardest job in the military is being a military spouse and my wife was one for most of my military career .
As a retiree she has medical benefits and arrangements have been made ( which are ONLY available to a legal spouse ) that she will receive part of my retirement check if I were to pass before she does so that she will have something to care for herself with .
Government non @-@ recognition of Civil Marriage means she would have no security in our elder years because while she raised our children while I was off defending our country she would have no access to my Social Security nor my military retirement .
Similar situations exist both in the government sector and the private sector - government not recognizing Civil Marriage is not something that will gain large support .
Not looking for support .
Just stating my mind .
All those things you mention are the twisted twine ball of the government .
Of course my family is entitled to all I have earned when I am gone .
It should be a matter of fact not a government regulation .
Nor should my family have to deal with the government in any way other than maybe to prove they exist if the government owes me .
Bigotry is the Republican core value .
And stupidity is yours .
Just government "@ twisted twine @" ball ?
Lets say that you are a small business owner .
The business is in your name .
One day coming home from work there is a car accident and you are killed and being fairly young and possessing in a sense of invulnerability you have not created a Will .
One of the "@ twisted twines @" of government recognition of Civil Marriage is that if someone passes without a will , their spouse is the inheritor of the estate and it is transferred to the surviving spouse with very little tax liability .
With Civil Marriage your wife is the recognized heir of your estate and the business passes to her .
Without Civil Marriage the passing of your business ( or portion thereof in the case of join ownership ) would not be viewed as the inheritance of a spouse , it would be viewed as income and therefore liable for taxes .
You owned the business ( or your share ) and (s)he owned nothing or his / her share - when your spouse acquired your portion - that is income on their part .
Without Civil Marriage your wife - in the eyes of the law - is not family and is as a stranger to you .
Without a will , under the inheritance laws of most states - strangers have no claim on an individuals estate and the property transfers to the next closest blood relative .
( Remember a spouse is not a "@ blood relative @" , they are a family member established because of recognition of Civil Marriage under the law . )
If you have no blood relatives ( or none come forward ) it 's even possible that the estate could pass to the government to dispose of .
You say "@ Nor should my family have to deal with the government in any way other than maybe to prove they exist if the government owes me @" yet there is no recognition of Civil Marriage establishing that bond between you and your spouse , then your spouse is not part of your family .
Then you say that your spouse may have to prove that she is your spouse - but that is the government recognizing her as family - something that if the government does n't recognize marriage they would not be able to do .
Logically speaking the government can not "@ not recognize marriage @" then turn around and "@ recognize marriage @" because when they recognize it , then logically they are no longer "@ not recognizing @" it .
What you describe is all more government en @"@ twinings @" .
What i am saying is all of that is none of governments business other than to enforce that my family owns my shit .
Period end of story end of involvement .
My family is whoever I said it was .
For the government to recognize that your family owns your stuff , you by default need government recognition that you have established a "@ family @" with another person who , prior to some point in time , was not a member of your family .
That 's what Civil Marriage is , it is the recognition of a family status between two people who are not blood relatives .
Without that recognition , under the eyes of the law - a spouse is just a live @-@ in boyfriend or girlfriend , they are not family .
Well I 'm off to bed .
FF , thanks for the discussion , I 'll leave the last post of the evening to you .
Thanks for the honest discussion and ( something rare around here sometimes ) an honorable exchange of ideas without it devolving into name calling and personal insults .
I enjoyed it immensely .

Well , I do n't agree that there is a constitutional "@ right @" to gay marriage .
But I think that the crafting of laws should be left to the legistlature .
That 's their function .
And unlike a referendum , they have the time and ability to craft laws .
The veto power of a governor or president should be reserved for instances when a legislature acts irresponsibly .
Here , it has n't .
Christy is just sucking up to a larger national stage .
Because he knows his fat ass is probalby done in the Gubenertorial election of 2013 .

Wow , so like do the voices in you head give you translations to perfectly valid arguments when you can n't refute them .

"@ Throw that Teacher to the Rancor ! @"
We hold these truths to be self evident , that all men are created equal @....
1 ) Not in the Constitution .
( It 's the Declaration of Independence )
2 ) Has nothing to do with whether or not the states ( the only entity that can regulate marriage ) should be able to define who can and can n't get married .
Which is why the marriage laws are different in all 50 states .
If you were to argue to me , that the laws should be changed because it 's not unreasonable to let two consenting adults marry , even if they are of the same Gender , then , yes , that 's not an imposition on anyone .
If you argue to me , marriage is whatever I want it to be because there 's an imaginary "@ I want to @" Clause in the 14 th Amendment , I do n't buy that shit at all .
the 14 th Amendment has been in the constitution since 1870 or so .
We are just noticing this now ?
Well , Gov Christie says we get to vote to decide who gets to be equal
yea until the Black or Brownie wants to move into your Neighborhood @....
Not in the Constitution ?
Who cares ?
It is the greatest political statement in the history of Man .
until both parties start living up to that it do n't mean shit @.....
And unfortunately , unless the NJ Legistlature grows a pair of balls , that 's probably what it 's going to come down to .
Or they can wait until he 's tossed out on his can in 2013 and get a Governor who will sign the law .
They may decide who can and can not marry provided the criteria are applied consistently , excluding no particular class of persons , predicated on a compelling governmental reason .
The 14 th Amendment requires that states and local jurisdictions allow all citizens equal access to the law .
However a given state defines marriage for opposite sex couples , must be applied to same sex couples as well .
1868 , actually ; the Bill of Rights was first incorporated to the states via the 14 th Amendment in 1897 , concerning the 5 th Amendment Taking Clause .
It ’s not so much a matter of noticing it now as it is a conflict concerning its appropriate application .
Clay , nice stretching , but the logic of "@ I want to @" in awarding marriage could strike down the incest and polygamy laws on the same basis .
No
Gov Christie made the call @....

He is now the George Wallace of Gay Rights @......

so only religious people should be married , DD ?
you want two tiers of relationships ?
one for religious folk and one for secular ?
if you do n't want government interference , I 'm sure you 'll agree that government should stay out of my uterus .
Never said that Jill @...
since when did I ever state anything like only religious people should get married ?
I think govt should stay out of your uterus @...
and also away from the life someone is trying to carve out of someone 's uterus
I agree that marriage is between a man and a woman but that can only be sanctified by God .
The founders were governed by social mores and never intended to insert religious mores into formal laws .
All things governing religion were so important to the founders , they included freedom of religion in the first amendment .
I 'm not buying the legal world prying at society 's girders to foist an anything @-@ goes society on American 's heads .
It 's absolutely unwise because we came over here on boats from a corrupt European system based on all the assets in the government 's hands crushing Christian believers .
Our ancestors came here to escape that .
Why would we bring all that back , along with the big government it takes to crush dissent ?
It 's less wise to do such a thing than you think , imho .
Is n't it funny how Cheney does the right thing when it affects him personally ?
This is a favorite meme for which I have never seen evidence .
These are what I call the marriage "@ cash and prizes @" the government protects by law .
The bigotry toward gays is so great , bigots are willing to cut their own throats rather than give homos the same protection under the law as them .
Right .
A liberal thinks there are all sorts of rights hidden in the 14 th Amendment @- gay marriage , abortion on demand @...
Can you show us where interracial marriage is protected in the Constitution ?
Actually it is in the Constitution , in the form of the 14 th Amendment @:
All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside .
No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws .
Because our rights are inalienable , no state may deny any citizen due process of the law , or equal access to the law .
When AIDS first appeared it was spread by gay men amongst each other .
Then it spread to straight people via bisexual sex and shared needles .
Today many more straight people than gays have HIV/AIDS .
All are unhealthy lifestyles .
When AIDS first appeared it was contracted by heterosexuals and transferred between heterosexuals before spreading to homosexuals .
When HIV first appeared as a mutation of SIV ( Simian Immunodeficiency Virus , confirmed through DNA Testing ) and passed to humans it is believe either through consumption of raw / undercooked meat or through blood exposure to a wound when humans hunted the animals .
The majority of HIV infections have been because of heterosexual relations .
HIV neither "@ appeared @" in gay men nor have the majority of the cases in the world been spread by gay men .
BTW you skipped these questions @: · 1 . So you are cool with lesbians getting a Civil Marriage because they have the lowest incidence of HIV infection ?
( Or is it just homosexual males you have an issue with [ which takes it back to being gender specific ] . )
2 . Would you support HIV testing as part of Civil Marriage requirements for all participants and the refusal of a license if an individual tests positive for HIV ?
What has HIV got to do with marriage ?
Nothing that 's what .
I was talking about all unhealthy lifestyles .
I was referring to when it started in America .
<a href="http://www.avert.org/aids-history-america.htm"> The History of HIV and AIDS in America </a>
Marriage helps prevent the spread of HIV by encouraging monogamous relationships
How does what some perceive to be a civil right have anything to do with the rule of law ?
Nobody has a right to marry , period , it is not in the constitution , therefore states have always handled marriage and marriage laws .
It does n't matter if it 's gay marriage or not , it simply is not a right , and that will n't change by calling it a civil right or a human right or blah blah blah .
Just because you change the terminology does not mean it changes the law as it is written .
If people want gay marriage , then get out the vote and have people vote it in .
So you disagree with the SCOTUS ruling that struck down State laws on interracial Civil Marriage because even though the 14 th Amendment required Due Process and Equal Protection under the law , that did n't apply to colored people ?
BTW - All citizens have a right to equal treatment under the law barring a compelling government interest and if they feel they have been wronged by the government they have a Constitutional right to address such grievances through the courts .
Yep , when you think about Civil Marriage promoting monogamous relationships*** then it actually become an argument FOR allowing Sames @-@ sex Civil Marriage .
*** If you do n't think Civil Marriage promotes monogamy , then ask someone whose been cause cheating on his / her spouse and how they got taken to the cleaners in the divorce .
Lol , I agree with Christie on this one , though Ithink he did it purely for politidcal gain and not because it was the right thing to do .
He did the right thing , it is up to the people to decide , not for the state government to dictate .
Then you are a statist conservative progressive @: you support mass democracy , not representative republicanism .
I do n't live in virginny .
I made the comment on a @.............
wait for it Message board
I know , I made a comment on a @.............
I am not blaming non compromise on anyone .
That is my position , and guess what @...
Hard to believe as it is .
Im independent and have n't voted for a repub since 2004 .
Funny thing is you said "@ It 's like the more shenanigans the libtards play , the less willing people are to seek middle ground at all . @"
I do n't see any reference as a counterpoint the shenanigans by social authoritarians to deny same-sex couples equal treatment under the law .
When one blames one side and ignores the other , that 's usually indicative of - well - blaming one side .
Personally I wish all of them the best .
Politically they can kiss my ass .
If you can n't leave me alone , I will n't leave you alone .
I am an asshole that way .
So people that are being denied equal treatment under the law are n't supposed to try to correct that .
You are probably just a good guy , they are the assholes for their expectations .
Discrimination is discrimination .
I do n't know what more I can add .
I am and have always been the guy that pushes back .
The guy never afraid to kick the table over .
In doing so you usually get quicker resolution .
It 's not based on gender .
It 's about a very unhealthy and harmful lifestyle .
What makes it unhealthy and harmful is the hatred directed at gays
No it 's the disease called aids .
Then you support gay marriage for lesbians then @...
because you heteros have a WORSE record on AIDS than we do .
1 . So you are cool with lesbians getting a Civil Marriage because they have the lowest incidence of HIV infection ?
See testing everyone for HIV and then refusing a Civil Marriage license would not be discriminatory based on gender .
P.S. You realize there are more heterosexuals with HIV/AIDS infections then homosexuals , right ?
AIDS first appeared in Africa and it was not gay men @....
but feel free to continue your little bugaboo .
Can you point me to the part of the constitution that gives you a right to marry ?
Because I have yet to find it anywhere in there .
You are the one who is clueless .
You can not claim that what you consider to be a human or civil right is also a constitutional right , it does not work that way .
It 's right next to the part that gives YOU the right to marry .
Wallace did not run as a Democrat .
They rejected him and what he stood for .
He did in 1972 ; go look it up .
You are correct , in 1972 , he ran as a Democrat AFTER repudiating Segregation .
in 1968 , while still supporting segregation , he ran as the American Independent Party candidate .
Palimony suits do not take you to the cleaners .
The two are different .
Unlike alimony , palimony settlements usually involve a lump sum paid at once , versus permanent monthly payments .
A further difference is that palimony does not divide "@ common assets . @"
In a palimony suit , the legal owner of any assets gets those assets without question , even if the partner has paid into them and considers them common property .
You can get fleeced with a palimony suit just as readily as a divorce .
Why are you automatically assuming that marriage will end in divorce ?
I 've been in a monogamous relationship with my life partner for over 16 years now .
Why is n't our relationship deserving of the same rights , benefits , privileges and protections of legal civil marriage that is granted heterosexual couples ?
Got anything that WILL stand up in a court of law as a reason to deny me this equality ?
I am not assuming , the statistic 's say that there is a very large number of marriages end in divorce whether it be straight or Gay 's .
I also said that you should have the same rights but doing it with laws .
I also said why it harms the nation as a whole .
Couples living together .
Sex without marriage .
Drug abuse , porn , sex trafficking , alcoholism and homosexuality , pedophiles and bestiality .
Whenever these type of sins become accepted by society , civilization starts to decay and fall .
All of this leads to the decline of the family unit .
A husband and wife who raise their families .
When things go well with the family , life is worth living , when the family falters , life falls apart .
When deadly sins like pedophiles , bestiality and homosexuality are accepted it decays the moral and spiritual values in a well ordered civilization .
Families are the foundation of a nation .
When one sin becomes more acceptable others follow .
If you get your marriage rights , what is stopping the next one , which is those that want to marry their animal sex partners .
They are coming out of the closet around the world now and are speaking out about their civil rights also .
Do you think couples who are not virgins should be allowed to marry ?
Is n't that a deadly sin ?
Our single parent birthrate is now at 50 %
Liberals seem to think uncle sam can do a better job then the actual fathers .
Chris Christie has always said , even during his election , that if it came to his desk , he would veto a bill on gay 's getting married .
So it came to his desk and unbelievable , he did what he said he would do .
Now Governor Christie has said that he wants the citizens of New Jersey to vote on the matter .
Oh my GAWD !
The audasity of this man !
Now I realize that for the left , a politician doing EXACTLY what he said he would do is unique .
I mean look at Barry and his pals .
The poster child for saying one thing in the campaign and doing another in reality .
We could start with Barry declining public financing .
We could move to 9 trillion dollars in debt being "@ unpatriotic @" , but let 's not bore everyone with details .
Besides the left is not big on facts .
States have the ability to define what marriage is .
In Oklahoma we have a constitutional amendment that defines it as one man and one woman .
Further , our state does not recognize marriages that do not conform to that definition from other states .
It is a state issue and it should be .
Do n't like it ?
Then do n't live there .
I also think that when Prop 8 from California gets to the Supreme Court , it 's going to be bad news for those of you that want it over turned .
But hey , we 'll see .
No it is not a deadly sin .
But homosexuality is even worse , God says it 's an abomination , worse that a deadly sin .
If more people would stop having sex any old time they wished , with as many people as they wanted to , the sexual diseases in this nation would decline dramatically though .
In justifying his impending veto , Christie also said that blacks wished that there could have been a vote on civil rights @......
it would have saved them a lot of aggravation
Thou shall not commit adultery is one of the ten commandments .
Homosexuality was never mentioned as a commandment
I do n't understand why you would want to be subject to divorce laws .
Where your partner could take you to the cleaners .
It 's so much better when , if your partner dies , you have no protection from their family taking everything @....
right .
Where does your god say that ?
Read post 326
Why do you think that commandment is there ?
Lucy goosey sex causes diseases and eventually death .
It does not matter what your sexual preference 's are .
Leviticus 18 @:@ 22 reads , "@ Thou shalt not lie with mankind , as with womankind @: it is abomination . @"
Leviticus 20 @:@ 13 .
It reads , "@ If a man also lie with mankind , as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination @: they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them . @"
The verses above from Leviticus are in a section of the Bible that lists immoral acts and the penalties for them .
Homosexual activities are listed right alongside other immoral acts such as having sex with animals , incestuous relationships , adultery , etc. God does not say that this behavior is something that you should have "@ gay pride @" about .
God calls it a sexual sin and says that because of such practices , the nations in the land were being cast out .
Leviticus 18 @:@ 24 , 30 reads , "@ Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things @: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you .
Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance , that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs which were committed before you , and that ye defile not yourselves therein @: I am the Lord your God . @"
And if we continue to be a nation that allows sex with anyone , any time with anyone .
He will turn his back on us and we will no longer have his blessings .
The Majority of this nation believes in God and believes that he will turn on us .
This is why homosexuality is a great harm to our society .
It always amuses me , this Cafeteria Christianity @....
now you follow the OT , now you do n't .
Answer me this @...
why are you not following ALL of Leviticus ?
You do n't happen to be a member of the Westboro Baptist Church do you ?
Ah @...
so the god with the most believers wins ?
And here I thought this was a secular country when it was really a god popularity contest .
This has never been a secular nation , ever .
From the beginning it has been a Christian nation and it still is a Christian nation .
I have lost many gay friends in the 80 's and 90 's .
All of them from HIV .
Most Christians do not hate Gay 's , they hate the sin .
I do n't write these things to judge anyone .
But as a Christian , I believe what God 's Word tells me .
And I care enough about each of you to share with you God 's truth .
I also care about this nation and if we continue down the path that we are going we will most defiantly fall as a nation .
Bullshit .
Bullshit
So @...
why do n't you follow , and want our laws to follow ALL of Leviticus ?
You have n't answered that yet .
Because gays are yucky and lobster tastes good
Peach must be busy .
She 's on line here but has n't answered as to whether or not she follows all of Leviticus , and whether or not she want 's our nation 's laws to follow all of Leviticus .
With me it was because being homosexual is unhealthy , but still have n't seen a response to Post #267 .
Opposing gay marriage is now bigotry ?
Priceless @....
Bullshit .
Drinking already ?
It 's about unhealthy lifestyles .
Not Dictating .

To those of you invoking the Bible , AGAIN ( yawn ) , SO WHAT if your God thinks someone is a "@ sinner @" @...@ ?
Wake up and get a clue , God said we are ALL sinners , so please DO try to get past that point with your failed logic @...
The US Constitution does not defer to the Bible and the 14 th Amendment does not exclude SINNERS .
All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside .
No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws .
Do you know the intention of the text which you are quoting ?
Mike
Oh shut the fuck up @...
Yeah , kinda like prop 8 that was democratically voted on ??
or Walker up in Wisconsin who was democratically elected , then passed an anti @-@ collective bargaining law in which democrats ran to Illinois and are now trying to recall him ??
How about Obama threatening to veto any bill that is passed by the House that makes it passed Senate ??????
But yeah , I bet no leftist slime fuck would have a problem with Obama vetoing a bill @..
As usual progressives are pathetic fucks @...
So what is the difference ?
If Alcoholics die fairly young , Drug users die fairly young , Smokers die fairly young , Obese people die fairly young and homosexuals die fairly young .
Why is it only one of the identified groups is being barred from Civil Marriage ( in most places ) .
Then logic dictates that it is not the "@ unhealthly lifestyle @" which is the reason for barring them from Civil Marriage when others who live unhealthy lifestyles are not barred from Civil Marriage .
The reality is that "@ unhealthy lifestyle @" is a dodge , a rationalization because it is not logically supported .
HIV/AIDS related deaths were 16,789 ( the lowest of the listed groups ) , with smoking related deaths were 394,195 ( the highest ) .
People are 2347.94 times more likely to die from smoking then from being a homosexual .
Yet smokers are allowed to Civilly Marry but homosexuals are not ( in most places ) .
The argument that the focus is that it is more "@ unhealthy @" does not ring true .
so much for "@ dieing fairly young @" ) [/QUOTE]
How many times do I have to say that gay 's should have their rights under the law ?
I bet you that they did not run around on their partners either and that 's how they made it to a ripe old age .
Where do you find a right in the Constitution ?
Without using interpretation , show me where you think that the right to be married lies in the Constitution ?
Better yet , show me where that authority is taken away from the states ?
Mike
Gee @...
you got us there .
NO ONE has the right to marry .
You are correct .
The power for that has been left to the states .
( Or we could just vote to have the state the hell out of our vows and have all marriages treated like contracts ? )
Mike
Makes you wonder how many lives could be saved if our society had a different view of drugs and drug users .
I wish we viewed it as a disease and as an opportunity to help people , rather than an opportunity to throw someone in jail .
And do n't @' read into that wrong , I 'm not advocating gov't set up some huge program .
Makes you wonder how many lives could be saved if our society had a different view of celebrities , drugs and drug users .
Celebrities i agree , we should n't worship them , I 've never understood that .
But i do n't get why we should hate someone , who after using a drug one time , has their mind altered so much that their brain demands they use again no matter the ramifications .
This coming from me , someone who 's never once used any illegal drug .
Not even weed .
Is that what you believe ?
That using a drug once alters one 's mind enough that their brain demands it ?
Sorry , I ai n't buying it .
We control our minds .
Our minds do not control us .
This coming from someone who has smoked weed and from someone who has turned her Life around for the better , knowing that everything I need comes from within .
But , I needed the assistance of outside sources to learn the powerful source I have within .
If it pumps their nadds to do so @...

Gov Christie has ordered that all state flags in NJ be lowered to half mast this Saturday to honor Whitney Houston
Is it appropriate ?
Yes .
No it 's not .
Why honor a crackhead ?
Ask a doctor how many uses it takes to get hooked on cocaine or meth .
One time , and a normally good person could get turned right into a fuck up .
I think we should use it as an opportunity to get the good person back , rather than throw that person in prison .
You goto prison for selling not using .
I 'm sure after getting caught using enough times you 'll go to jail .
But even still , removing the black market for selling drugs would keep a lot of non @-@ violent ppl out of prisons .
ABSOLUTELY NOT !!!!
That would be a disgrace @...
I have a hard time believing a guy like Christie would do such a thing - yet he did .
Fucking RINO @...
Houston was no goddamn patriot and is NOT deserving of such a "@ communication @" of honor .
Whoa @...
I pulled the '@ give-a-shit @' meter out of the desk drawer and I could n't even get it to register .

Yup and if the Gov in NJ wants to honor Houston then so what .
I 'm sure he 'll hear from the residents of NJ if they do n't like it .
NC flew its flags at half staff when Dale Earnhardt was killed and no one gave a shit .

The American flag gets crapped on and burned .

entertainer .
NOOOoooooo @.........
I asked because he was a NASCAR driver and the Confederate Flag gets more air time than the US Flag
You mean because she did n't anonymously battle evil Liberals on an internet message board like you ?
POS .
Personally , I oppose it
Not because she was a drug user but because her primary contribution was a pop music star
I think putting flags at half staff should be reserved for military , police , firefighters , public servants and not for someone who was just famous
you know , there was a public school of the arts named for her in NJ . do you know how much money she gave to that school and others ?
do you know what type of contributions she made to the state ?
i do n't , .
btw @...
and I 'm kind of thinking it 's a little silly to do this , but it really does n't change the world .
I honestly do n't know .
But what I do know is for a generation now we have tried to label bad behavior as a medical condition .
That removes any element of personal responsibility and as such we 've had a generation of youth drugged by doctors diagnosis 's of this ailment or that .
It 's sad
To make the painful decision to inter the appropriate rehab for the condition and stick with it takes plenty of personal responsibility @.....
As for the OP , not a fan of the Governor by any stretch but I 'm fine with the decision .
Do you think that rehab works ?
Did it work for Any Weinhouse ?
She wrote a song about how it does n't work .
It made her a lot of money .
Did rehab work for Charlie Sheen ?
Did rehab work for Whitney Houston ?
Rehab does n't work .
The function of rehab is to teach people how to be more creative in assigning blame for their addictions .
We honor the absolute WORST among us .
Schools lower flags to half mast to honor gang bangers who are murdered by other gang bangers .
Tell that to all the people who have been helped by Betty Ford .
Whitney Houston was knocking back straight whiskeys at 8 AM the day she died AFTER a night of heavy partying .
It takes real committment to the lifestyle to find this honorable .
Jim Beam might want to lower their company flag to half mast .
That I can see .
Mexico might want to lower it 's flag to half mast .
There might have been a time when Whitney Houston was a worthy person and could sing .
That has n't been for 15 years at least .
At the time of her death she was reprehensible .
Link ?
Idiot @...
the ICBM force was moved from AFSPC to AFGSC to align the ICBMs and bombers under "@ one AF Commander @" to increase the focus on nukes .
Your dumbass did n't know that .
Towards the end of Gen Kehler 's time at AFSPC he was in charge of space and cyberspace for the AF , but now at STRATCOM he is in charge of all DoD space , cyberspace , bombers , SLBMs and ( drumroll ) ICBMs .
Your claim that we only have "@ 14 @" ICBMs at "@ 3 @" missile bases spread out across an area larger than Rhode Island shows you are the biggest dumbass on this board next to rdean .
You are digging to China .
Obamination floated the idea of cutting our nuclear arsenal by 80 % to the Pentagon .
The response back to the White House from the Pentagon @....
"@ Nuts ! @"

Idiot , if we lower our numbers to say 4 , Russia to 6 , and China to 4 @....
we are losing the ability to counter "@ both @" threats .
Throw in Iran getting nukes along with NK 's nukes .
It 's clear your tiny brain does n't understand deterrence .
Yeah , Russia and China are our friends and do n't have nukes .
Iran is also one of our buddies too @.....
eh ?
The cold war is over , amazing how many people still get a feeling of security from having the ability to sterilize the biosphere .
Keep enough to merely destroy mankind and shitcan the rest .
Typical all or nothing response , Who is talking about getting rid of them ?
I am suggesting that the ready capability for total Armageddon is a useless waste of money and resources .
We almost certainly have the capability to destroy the bulk of mankind several times over , we could lose much of it and still maintain an acceptable balance of terror for scared people like yourself .
How many nukes do we have ?
Do we really need them all ?
How many times over do we need to destroy the earth as habitable for humans
I 've been hearing that since the 60 s .
Same ole , same ole .
When we 're no longer the biggest kid on the block you will get the answer to your questions .
Besides , this country has become too chicken shit to use nukes ever again anyway .
We are rapidly losing the global economic war .
Actually global economics and enhanced communications have made for a smaller interlinked world .
Which makes for less of a nuke threat .
We would not want to nuke our factories in China now would we ?
Of course we will Always have some rogue elements in all societies that could obtain and use nukes .
The more that are laying around the greater the chance of that .
Oh come on peachy thinks we 've hidden nuclear bombs underneath her trailer park @...
all 14 of those ICBMs .
But @....
she did n't answer your question .
You did not answer my question .
There is no answer ; that problem REMAINS .
Some of the material ( as nuclear components are termed ) is buried .
Deep underground in areas where there are few earthquakes , or in lots of concrete .
*********************************************** · In the United States alone , the Department of Energy states there are "@ millions of gallons of radioactive waste @" as well as "@ thousands of tons of spent nuclear fuel and material @" and also "@ huge quantities of contaminated soil and water . @"
[ 13 ] Despite copious quantities of waste , the DOE has stated a goal of cleaning all presently contaminated sites successfully by 2025 .
[ 13 ] The Fernald , Ohio site for example had "@ 31 million pounds of uranium product @" , "@ 2.5 billion pounds of waste @" , "@ 2.75 million cubic yards of contaminated soil and debris @" , and a "@ 223 acre portion of the underlying Great Miami Aquifer had uranium levels above drinking standards . @"
[ 13 ] The United States has at least 108 sites designated as areas that are contaminated and unusable , sometimes many thousands of acres .
[ 13 ] [ 14 ] DOE wishes to clean or mitigate many or all by 2025 , however the task can be difficult and it acknowledges that some may never be completely remediated .
In just one of these 108 larger designations , Oak Ridge National Laboratory , there were for example at least "@ 167 known contaminant release sites @" in one of the three subdivisions of the 37,000 @-@ acre ( 150 km2 ) site .
[ 13 ] Some of the U.S. sites were smaller in nature , however , cleanup issues were simpler to address , and DOE has successfully completed cleanup , or at least closure , of several sites .
[ 13 ] · ******************************** · Some of this is from old nukes .
Nuclear plants and nuclear medical waste , not weapons .
Obama gets his orders from Skynet through the teleprompter he keeps in the Lincoln bathroom .
I owe you rep .
But @....
we only have "@ 14 @" ICBMs according to you , so that is close to my example of 10 .
Now @....
the trick question is how many "@ nukes @" are on each ICBM @.....
"@ Used nuclear arsenal ? @"
We want to have reserves if a war breaks out or enough to make other side think twice about pulling a fast one on us .
If they have 10 bombs and you lower your numbers to 2 bombs , they might get the crazy idea of taking out your 2 bombs with say 5 @-@ 6 of their bombs @...
then they own you .
We have thousands of active nuclear weapons , not "@ 10 @" .
True , our problem was getting ours to "@ THEM @" before theirs got to the US .
SLBM 's and cruise missiles helped even out the geographical disadvantage .
Yeah , we should get rid of nukes and not threaten China with them because they have our debt .
Instead we should just surrender to them @...
right ?
Idiot , china is n't part of START .
China does n't mind if Obamination lowers our nukes with "@ promises @" from Russia doing the same or slightly less like they typically do .
Uh , the word is leaking out that Obamination floated the idea which would be a surrender order if followed by the Pentagon .
I 'm sure Gen Kehler kindly said @....
"@ This would endanger our nation if executed . @"
Under his breath he said "@ Nuts . @"
A dew facts which belie the rightwing claims @: · ****************************************** · The Pentagon 's press secretary , George Little , declined to comment on specific force level options because they are classified .
He said Obama had asked the Pentagon to develop several "@ alternative approaches @" to nuclear deterrence .
The U.S. could make further weapons reductions on its own but is seen as more likely to propose a new round of arms negotiations with Russia , in which cuts in deployed weapons would be one element in a possible new treaty between the former Cold War adversaries .
Stephen Young , senior analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists , which favors nuclear arms reductions , said Tuesday , "@ The administration is absolutely correct to look at deep cuts like this .
The United States does not rely on nuclear weapons as a central part of our security . @"
You are hilarious !
The START ( Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ) has nothing to do with the rotation of the earth favoring a missile launched from the WESTERN USA hitting China before one launched from China hit the USA .
It is the rotation of the earth which influences strike .
Since peachy thinks we only have 14 ICBMs and they are used as "@ back @-@ ups , @" we need to notify the 90 launch control officers and +200 security forces and maintenance personnel currently in the missile complexes that they can go home tonight @...
It 's clear you are in an insane asylum .
HERE IS THE FIRST PART OF THE QUOTE @:
Due to historic activities typically related to radium industry , uranium mining , and military programs , there are numerous sites that contain or are contaminated with radioactivity .
Idiot @...
he is pointing out cyberspace can do more for us without huge damage like ICBMs .
But of course , you figured he meant to get rid of ICBMs because cyberspace is a new tool .
ICBMs are the our last line of defense for this country along with bombers and SLBMs @....
so they will be used last , but if you idiots get rid of them then there is no last line of defense .
A REAL quote from General Kahler , not from the confounded mind reader , who is SURE he knows what Kahler is thinking @:
And the military command in charge of a cyberattack now believes it ’s legally in the clear to conduct “@ offensive operations of any kind , @” Air Force Gen. Robert Kehler , its chief , told Reuters .
If there is an Israeli attack on Iran , U.S. military planners will probably be taking notes .
**************************************** · CYBER attack capability is what the US wants , and needs .
That is why Kehler speaks of SPACE & TECHNOLOGY , not the outdated ICBM 's .
Disarming the opponent by computers is at the forefront of nuclear technology in THIS century , and millennium .
Jeeze , who is talking about getting rid of them ?
No one .
Uh , Reagan got rid of old ICBM systems because we had the MMIII in place .
The MMIIIs are being upgraded and there is no alternative to them @.....
idiot .
Some are outdated , some redundant .
I doubt those opposed to cuts understand how many we have .
That 's what he did with the START Treaty - he got several other countries to give up live weapons while we gave only outdated and unusable weapons .
I read this on couple of news sites .
We do n't rely on nuclear weapons and we can , at this time , kill other countries something like 700 times over .
So we get rid of some older weapons and can only kill other countries 400 times over .
So what .
This is the kind of the thing the rw 's just LOVE to go off half cocked about .
I 'll bet the email lies are flying back and forth .
First rule - do n't confuse them with facts .
Funniest part of this is that this is what Reagan tried to do .
LOL
You are just a nut and a dumb one too , on the internet talking to someone that briefed Gen Kehler numerous times @.....
he came into my office one morning and warned me about eating Burger King food for breakfast .
It is clear you know little about nuclear weapons .
SLBM means SEA LAUNCHED ballistic missiles .
That and cruise missiles are our primary defense sources .
Even in 1981 , a negotiator at the original SALT talks told my class "@ We have cruise missiles that could hit the men 's room of the Kremlin @" .
The man 's name is Albert Carnesale .
He knew quite a bit about the subject ; if you know ANYTHING about the history of nuclear weapons , you have heard of him .
That 's nice ; those who go by the name GONE @"@ BEZERK @" obviously think about the mental health of others .
Did you discuss ICBM 's in cyberspace with the General , or did the nice men in white coats put the cloth restraints back on ?
Obamination said he hopes to get rid of all nukes someday .
That is the plan @....
to slowly get rid of them .
He lowered the numbers soon as getting into office and wa @-@ laa he now wants more cuts @.....
huge cuts .
Shocking @.....
Little girl , you spell his name wrong .
Your crackhead is busy looking up stuff on wikipedia to try to keep up with me with your made up stuff too .
I worked in this world for years before moving on to new things that are even more cutting edge and on the news than this @....
There are nuts in the White House that want 0 nukes , I 've seen them up close .
The point is lowering our nuke levels with promises from Russia is stupid when we end up with less nukes than China and Russia in addition to NK . It is a numbers game that you do n't want to be inferior for survival .
If the Russia @-@ China alliance thingy ever comes back someday , we 'd be screwed .
Worst case scenario ( for you anyway ) ends with us having 300 deployed nukes , is that not enough ?
How about 700 ?
how about the 1550 we have now ?
Or the thousands of others we could assemble in short order ?
What is an acceptable number for you ?
Your love of these obscene weapons is pretty damned creepy .
There is no way we will ever have zero nukes , quit worrying about that .
The cold war is over , the need for a balance of terror is not as acute and we could store them in a way where they could be called into service quickly if an arms race ever heated up , keep a few hundred ready and be no worse off except we save several hundred billion dollars a year .
There is no way on earth we need to keep 1550 nukes ready at all times , it 's a waste .
I would love to live in a world where there are no nukes but it 's not going to happen , if we are stuck with them I would prefer a program that matches the actual threat , not paranoid fantasies .
Shut the fuck up , idiot .
SLBMs are not replacing ICBMs , we still have 3 missile wings located in WY , ND and MT . SLBMs serve a different purpose than ICBMs in our overall scheme which you do n't have a clue about , cleatus .
The rest of your ALCMs and SIOP rundown is @.....
Dumbass @....
the ICBM force is pretty cost efficient .
The weapons last for decades and require minimum maintenance compared to tanks , ships and airplanes .
They are the biggest bang for the buck and have kept your sorry ass protected ever since you started sucking O2 .
ICBM 's are being replaced by SLBM 's .
Cruise missiles are the best course .
The launch of an ICBM would be immediately detected .
And weapons launched from the former Soviet Union would hit the US FIRST even if launched a short time LATER .
( ROTATION OF THE EARTH ) .
We need marine based SLBM 's and cruise missiles , NOT ICBM 's .
********************************************* · "@ Additionally , ICBMs are generally considered to be nuclear only ; although several conceptual designs of conventionally @-@ armed missiles have been considered , the launch of such a weapon would be such a threat that it would demand a nuclear response , eliminating any military value to such a weapon . @"
********************************************* · Any general in the US who says NUTS to reducing ICBM 's needs to RETIRE or be in a mental health facility .
You seem , uh , DISTRESSED by facts BEZERK .
I brought up SLBM 's & cruise missiles which ARE are primary nuclear weapons .
The focus now however , is on cyber attacks .
Catch up on your reading .
Or have someone read about recent technology to you .
Yeah , I came here to lie to impress a twit like you .
Sorry that some of us in life and done things you do n't know about @....
like flown a jet , been in a submarine , worked with nukes , etc. , etc.
Um , I worked with them for around 9 years @....
I know about the SIOP than you do .
Sure you did and I 'm sure you can prove it too .
Right ?
You do n't want to believe others when they talk about their service .
Why should anyone here take your word for it ?
Republican Worship of Greed
Democrats want their precious government to track , control and redistribute every dollar in our economy , and it 's "@ Republicans @" who are greedy @....
What a moron , then again bigots are @...
We always hear about the redistrubution of wealth from the right but FACTS clearly show that there has been a redistribution of wealth upwards for decades .
Funny how some folks on the right ignore that fact .
Like good little sheep , they willingly move along to the slaughter of America 's core , Main Street America .
Chart 1 , represents the redistribution of icome .
Chart 2 , represents the decline of the working classes share of the National Income .
The "@ working class @" represents a huge majority of Americans .
Mitt Romney represents everything that is kind of wrong with the GOP today .
It 's the kind of self defeating mentality of a coyote who chews off three legs and is still caught in the trap .
Let 's talk about what makes the GOP admirable .
It is a party of limited government , self @-@ reliance and freedom to persue happiness .
Absolutely good traits .
But the firewall against creeping European Socialism is a strong middle class with skin in the game .
One that can have pride in bringing home a paycheck .
A middle class , unfortunately , the Mitt Romneys of the world have been doing their very best to dismantle .
Get rid of that good paying union job at AmPad , move that good paying job at DDi to China , make bigger profits for your investors .
We 'll replace them with McJobs at Staples and Dominos Pizza that pay minimum wage and have no benefits .
When you take away the ability of working people to make good money , when they require food stamps and school lunches to feed their kids , when they need section 8 vouchers to put a roof over their head , when they need a Earned Income Credit to make up for the money they are n't earning at their jobs at Staples , when they have to apply for Medicaid to see a doctor , or rely on Social Security because they sharks on Wall Street made a killing manipulating the market while they were locked into crashing 401 K 's .
When you do these things , you create more dependence on Government .
You make it more palatable for people , and they are more inclined to vote for Democrats .
Oh , you can fool some of them by creating upset about guns or gays or abortion or affirmative action , for a while , but eventually they figure it out .
If our politics today has become a choice between big business and big government , you do n't want to make big government more attractive .
But they are doing exactly that .
Every time Joe says " Ampad , @" David Axelrod pays Joe $ 1 .
In this post , Joe earned $ 1 .
Yet you propose massive government intervention to solve what you see as the problem .
And you call yourself a Republican .
Go figure .
I will admit foreign policy @-@ wise its a push , but domestically ( which most Americans care more about ) he is a disaster !
The deficit , TRUE unemployment numbers , the unemployment numbers they pelt on us , Obaminationcare , Dodd / Frank Bill , Refusal of the Pipeline , Offshore Drilling memorandum , stiffing natural gas exploration , Gas prices approaching $ 4 a gallon , failed stimulus plans , further erosion of our manufacturing base , record food stamps claims , increasing poverty rates , record foreclosure rate , record homes underwater rate and the list goes on and on .
Fast and Furious !
Record days on the golf course ( even more than Bush ) .
His wife 's over the top expensive and insulting numerous vacations .
His record overseas is n't as bad as many make it seem , but his record stateside is horrendous !
He is one of the worst economic Presidents in history !
I am an Israel supporter and people would call as a Republican and I am very much against Obama 's vision for America !
That said , a label that is being tossed at Obama CONSTANTLY is that he is antiIsrael .
I used to buy it , but now I see it only as propaganda against him .
His actions speak louder than other people 's words !
Look at his record @: · ( 1 ) Obama has n't stopped the military aid and will n't even consider it !
( 2 ) Obama has n't imposed any sanctions on Israel and FIGHTS them if presented with them .
( 3 ) He defends Israel in every growing Muslim pandering ( because of the growing Muslim population ) and antisemitic Europe .
( 4 ) Obama has protected Israel in the antiIsrael UN .
( 5 ) Obama has pushed tough sanctions on Iran and has taken a strong stance against them .
He has done something Bush has done and got Europe on board with his policy .
( 6 ) Obama stated in ISLAMIC COUNTRIES that the bond btw American and Israel is unshakable .
( 7 ) Obama has provided funds for the Iron Dome .
( 8 ) Imports from Israel have increased under Obama .
( 9 ) Obama is killing terrorist and fighting the war on terror with vigor .
( 10 ) He has sold high tech military warplanes to Israel and is committed to Israel 's military tech edge .
So Obama talks bad about the so-called "@ Settlements @" ( which is a bullshit argument in the end ) , well in this PC antisemitic world he needs to in order to save face around the world , esp the antisemitic Saudis , Egyptians and Europeans .
So he insulted Bibi .
Bibi seems like an asshole .
He insulted the man not the country .
I am sure there are countries around the globe insulting Obama , but are not antiAmerican !
He is not bad for Israel and he is n't even close to antiIsrael .
He is bad for America and the American economy and that is what we need to care about !
So Please Stop Pelting The Obama AntiIsrael Propaganda !!!
You guys realize that when you have rabid anti @-@ Obama RWers with Obama @-@ Derangement Syndrome like Ghooks making public statements like this means that the GOP is toast this election right ?
I mean , if you have n't noticed , Obama 's been systematically removing all possibilities of RW talking points and attacks against him and the left with his Presidency .
They can n't call him weak , ask Osama and Khadaffi @...
and the pirates , they can n't call him Anti @-@ Israel , for the things just said , they can n't call him anti @-@ guns , we 've never experienced more gun freedom and loose laws concerning them , the list goes on .
Thinking America recognizes this already , and the fold will only grow .
Keep up the rabid squeaking and squawking about Obama RWers @....
let me know how that works out for you on Nov. 2 .
LOL !!!
The guy views Isreal and America as the problem .
It 's the whole oppressed oppressor thing @..
More rhetoric that has some truths , but is mostly a red herring .
He sees the I/P conflict as an important issue that is n't going away .
He wants to solve it !
Some of his words and actions have not been in Israel 's favor , but overall its well dishonest to characterize him as antiIsrael .
He truly believe he is not a full support of capitialism .
He comes from a hippie upbring that says corporations are bad and always out to get you .
He believes in European @-@ Socialism ( I do n't think he believes in Soviet or Communist @-@ Socialism ) and the welfare state .
I think that is a more accurate characterization .
I am a conservative Republican who is going to vote for Obama this election .
And no , he has n't done Jack for the country and I am totally at odds with his liberal socialist agenda .
So why would I vote for him and encourage others to pull the lever for Obama ?
Because after he wins the election he can tell AIPAC to stuff it .
Then I believe he will be the first setting American to read the riot act to Israel and it 's fascist government .
Not having to worry about re @-@ election will allow Obama the freedom to throw off the Zionist slave chains that are wrapped around the presidency .
Placing America first ; and Israel a far distance second .
Obama taking this patriotic stance is far more important for our nation 's security and safety than any other single issue or threat we face as a freedom loving people .
Voting for a man with so much muslm blood on his hands , sad .
But I agree with GHook , the "@ Obama hates Israel and jews @" blather is brought to us by the Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson type of republicans .
The ones who only debate with emotion and hysterics and are n't trying to make a point , just trying to get attention and the "@ wow @" factor .
Debt , deficits , Obamacare , garbage economy , plenty of legitimate reasons to hate Obama .
No need to drum up emotional diatribe .
The evil muslims will never defeat Gods chosen people , but that is another topic .
Blaming him for debt , deficits or the economy is as bad .
Actually @....
I see this adminstaration taking an approach to Israel as we should be taking .
For years we treated Israel like it was the end all @.....
Sure , they are a great ally @....
but no more important to us than our other allys @...
and on the most part , our other allys respect us @...
and we respect them @...
and that is where it ends @....
we do n't treat any of them like they are on a pedestal @...
and we should n't with Irsrael .
This adnministration is heeding to its responsibilities as an ally of Israel , but not putting it on a pedestal .
So what is this adminstratiuon doing ?
Treating Israel like another ally @...
and nothing more .
I know I know , Bush forced him not to make any spending cuts in order to pay for the war and he was powerless to keep the debt from increasing .
Also when Obama takes a crap , Otis Spunkmeyer cookies come out .
True story .
Do n't be silly now !
and thanks for that image .
He did make spending cuts .
But you do n't cut off your nose to spite your face .
I am nore critical of him not protecting Americans fron vulture captialism ( although a lot of legislation has been blocked ) , signing parts of the unPatriot Act and signing NDAA .
I 'm talking about cuts to the overall budget , we know he 'll never do that , regardless of how much it 'll skyrocket debt and cost our kids and grandkids .
( do n't worry , I know reps will spend us into oblivion also )
and yes I 'm glad you 're critical of him for those things , a sincere kudos to you .
Most Obama supporters just ignore them .
I 'm not sure you can call me an Obama supporter .
There are a few Repubicans I would vote for over Obama .
Of course the only one left is Ron Paul , maybe Mittens .
I do n't see this as an issue worthy of such hysteria .
1 . I have n't seen any Obama hates Israel threads in months .
2 . As a regular Fox viewer I have n't seen it there in recent months either .
In fact I have n't seen it much at all since Obama made the ridiculous border statements .
You are such an uneducated douche bag !
Thanks Seabiscuit !
Hopefully when Bush made the exact same border statements in a speech in the middle east , you also called them ridiculous .
Most republicans only freaked out when Obama said it .
It would be and is equally stupid no matter who 's mouth it comes out of .
This is actually quite amazing .
Being a conservationist I have no problem with green energy projects .
I believe in multiple sources of energy .
On the other hand I do have a problem with taxpayer dollars funding failures on the whims of nutjobs in Washington .
Earlier this week , Stimulus beneficiary Evergreen Energy bit the dust .
Then , Ener1 , a manufacturer of batteries for electric vehicles and recipient of Stimulus largesse , filed for bankruptcy .
And today , the Las Vegas Sun reports that Amonix , Inc. , a manufacturer of solar panels that received $ 5.9 million from the Porkulus , will cut two @-@ thirds of its workforce , about 200 employees , only seven months after opening a factory in Nevada .
This is just this week alone .

They still pale to comparison to the $ 500,000,000 wasted on Solyndra .
Someone needs to go to jail for that one .
Damn straight .
What really bothers me about this is that if you study Euro models of green energy , they are actually effective and do able ( how do you spell that ) .
The issue is cost effectiveness .
I was watching one business program with an awesome finance critic Amanda Lang and she had gone to Germany to interview people who had succeeded in affordable green .
But all I see over here is the government throwing cash at an issue demanding no results .
Consequently getting none either .
Just that deep flushing sound .
You are right Avatar , Newt *@ might @* not be lying about wanting an "@ open marriage @" with his second wife .
However He claimed he had people lined up to back him up and in the end he had no one .
Next I assume Newt as the religious guy he claims to be got married under God .
until dead does them apart @...
Maybe the vows were different , however I 'm highly doubting it .
In the end Newt is a pathological liar , and for him to be right about his second wife I 'd have to take his word against his second wife ’s @...
He did cheat on her and leave her .
Newt is not trustworthy on the subject matter of commitment and marriage or on any political position , so he has no credibility .
I ’d take a moldy apples word over Newts .
Sex , lies and Twitter .
You sure you 're a conservative ?
That shit is meaningless to me .
I missed the debate BUT @....
WTF Newt
You republicans are a mess – you ’ve no idea what you want .
You ‘@ hate @’ Obama and want to ‘@ get rid of him @’ but you hate Romney , too .
When Gingrich tries to take Romney out , you complain about that as well .
Some of us know what we want .
This nation would be in better shape now if Romney had been elected in 2008 , and he is my choice now .
edit @: I should n't reinforce the assumptions you made about people who oppose Romney but they simply do n't apply at all to some of us .
Not all of us "@ hate @" Romney .
Might be , but he really has no reason to be .
He has more than enough money himself .
Not sure why he 's trying to pretend he is n't rich .
For middle and liberal support ?
But why would decieving them really get their support ?
I do n't understand these politicians .
Whats the point of getting "@ Supporters @" if you get them dishonestly ?
They turn on you the first second they realize you are lying
This is why I can n't stand Paul haters .
They dislike one or maybe two things about Paul and it 's allll over with for him @...
Then these same people run off and support self declared progressives ( Newt and Mitt ) , then have a fit when it looks like Paul supporters might not vote for a morally and politically corrupted person like Newt , costing the Republicans their election .
Is Paul perfect ?
No … Is Newt even borderline “@ meh @” ?
No … Is Mitt really conservative ?
Lol , no … maybe with his companies but not with his state .
I appreciate the accomplishments Newt had during his term as speaker .
Most importantly welfare to work and bringing the Gop to power .
Working across the isle to create a balanced budget with a surplus .
I also like many of his current ideas .
I do n't like his soaring liberal rhetoric as it relates to Mitt .
This is the 3 rd time I 've answered this question all be it with less detail this time .
Please stop asking .
Ok , thank you .
As far as I know it was the first time I have asked you .
I still will say Newt might have been *@ part @* of the reason we got a balanced budget but remember Newt is a very real *@ part @* of the reason we got the housing crisis and the DoEducation , among other Government growth that has helped bankrupt this country .
As a Paul fan I see Newt 's best 5 minutes of his political life as just another day in Paul 's political career .
The housing crisis was set in motion long before Newt came along .
As far as the Dep of Edu , I do n't know anything about it or its origins .
I 'm watching the post debate coverage and can n't believe my ears , AGAIN .
Newt railing on Romney AGAIN about his money .
Bitching about Romneys investments .
WTF ? !
I want to support Newt but he keeps spouting liberal hate lines .
The only one that does n't is Paul and Santorum .
Paul will n't win and Santorum , even if he did , is so polarizing that I do n't know if he could beat Obama .
Newt is so desperate to beat Romney that it seems he will stoop to any level , including the anti capitalism liberal lines .
I tell you Grampa , my head 's spinning between Newt and Romney on this BS between them .
I just read a press release , well grab this .
I thought my head was going to explode .
Damn this is crazy .
“@ It surprises me that Mitt Romney and his supporters would raise this issue — when Mitt by his own admission voted for Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale who opposed my father , and later supported liberal Democrat Paul Tsongas for president .
A direct quote from Michael Reagan who is so pissed at Romney now .
I need some aspirins .
My head hurts from this shit .
Pardon my french .
This link is wild .
Has a quote from Nancy Reagan too .

Gingrich has some explaining to do about things he has said about Reagan .
Better to know these things now than to hear about them after the nomination is settled and Obama uses them to make Gingrich look bad .
p.s. , your link did n't work for me , but I used your quote to find this one @: <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/InsideCover/Limbaugh-Reagan-Gingrich-Romney/2012/01/26/id/425666"> Mike Reagan , Rush Limbaugh Blast Romney </a>
Oh agree .
I mean whoever wins we can rejoice that they 've been completely vetted nothing short of a proctology exam by each other
But who knows that might come up too the way it 's freaking going
ps the board will n't let me give you any more rep today for your new avatar .
I tried .
What a cutie patootie !
Let me know when RepubliCONZ are willing to pay more in taxes to help raise all these unwanted kids if abortion is made illegal .
Or does your concern about "@ life @" only extend to the uterus and not when the kid is squirted into the real world and needs parents who will give a crap about them ?
Kind of a weak argument given the long waiting list to adopt
Not really .
I 've NEVER heard of RepubliCONS asking for a tax increase to pay for a social program .
How many abortions last year ?
How many families on the adoption waiting list ?
Come up with THOSE numbers and you 'll have something .
I already know what they are .
I 'll let YOU come back and post them and show how WRONG I am .
How about that ?
You 'll find you get what you deserve when you say stuff you DO N'T know to be true or not to me .
millions are estimated as wanting to adopt
All you have just told me is that you do n't know the man at all .
That 's ok , since you would not vote for him .
Hyperbole is not logical .
Even the Republicans are not even voting for him @: just ask the voters in South Carolina .
Have lived in that state , and , he does not have the values of the south period .
He will just say whatever to get elected .
In fact , I hope he gets elected if Obama does not get re @-@ elected .
The Republicans will just hate him .
And you know this HOW ?
What 's your source ?
The 1995 National Survey of Family Growth found that 500,000 women were currently seeking to adopt a child .
( Freundlich , 1998 )
<a href="http://statistics.adoption.com/information/adoption-statistics-hoping-to-adopt.html"> Adoption Statistics @: Hoping to Adopt </a>
That 's not a million is it ?
Again , I say , that you will REGRET saying stuff you do n't know for a fact to be true or not , to me .
Mit Romney , now that he is running for president , says he is now ‘@ pro @-@ life @’ and support the movement – even as a bussinnessman that makes millions from the China policy of one child per @-@ family .
With Mit Romney , and the millions of dollars that come busineess in Citizen United rulling @: all have a hand in some way or the other with the China policy of the ‘@ single child policy @’ @..
That just makes not one damn bit of sense .
Back to Apple Computer that employees half a million citizens of China @: most of the workforce are young women under the age of thirty @..
Link ?
Ilogical lefty nonsense .
Yes .
Yes he is .
Newt has a high unlikablitity quotient in my opinion .
I just do n't think we are going to elect someone we do n't @' fundamentally like .
The President has to connect a "@ warm fuzzy @" to people on some level .
Clinton and W had a certain rascal type quality .
And , something about Obama seems likeable even if you hate his policies .
And , that is something needed to become President .
Romney has a "@ Father Knows Best @" aura around him so i do n't think people dislike him .
But , Newt comes across as arrogant , mean , and just nasty at times and i do n't think he can over come that with Happy talk .
< crickets >
I am feeling very jealous of TM and Rdean because they can post a stupid and get 57 instant responses .
Come on folks , does n't anyone have anything to say to this ?
Your post is intelligently and reasonably stated .
The facts about Clinton 's foibles are accepted by most reasonable people .
Maybe a little long for the likes of TM and Rdean , because I would think they would take issue with the thrust of some of the content .
Seems you have to flame people to get their attention .
Good post Baruch .
The double standard allows democrats to ignore what they call "@ family values @" because the democrat party does not promote or endorse morality .
It 's a great advantage for a democrat candidate to be immune to allegations of improper conduct while accusing republicans .
In the great debate over Newt and his love life , people keep bringing up the case of Clinton .
I believe this to be a case of apples and oranges .
Clinton was in trouble for suborning perjury in a civil rights case where he was the defendant .
That was also about a blow job , of course .
He insisted one of the workers at the DMV give him one and she turned him down and got fired because of that .
However during the clinton debate the Democrats kept going on and on about the blow job .
Fundamentally , I think it squicked everyone out to the point they wanted the story over .
Plus there was the whole april -@ december aspect of Monica 's mental maturity and age .
Normal people found the whole thing beyond disgusting .
Presidential philandering is not new .
And where he sticks his wand can be a matter of national importance .
John and Robert Kennedy both shared the same girlfriend with Sam Giacanna .
This , had we be wiling to talk about it seriously at the time , would have been legitimate cause for concern .
The face that James Buchanan was effectively the wife of Alabama Senator King also should have got a bit more scrutiny in the run up to the Civll war .
But over the years we have sort of thrown a blanket over Presidential private lives .
For good or ill .
President Cleveland 's daughter Ruth was an issue in the campaign , but it did his opponents no good because he was busy discussing tariffs and the depredations of the railroads .
He never did marry Ruth 's mother .
The relationships between Roosevelt and Eleanor and whomever are a matter of titillation but no historical relevance .
Eisenhower and Summersby is ignored again because it is pointless and squicky .
The fact that Nixon and Carter were uxorious did not make them good presidents .
Pat Nixon 's love for Dick did n't solve the Watergate issue , nor did Roselyn 's affection for Jimmy reduce the inflation rate .
Clinton 's tomcatting did n't make him a failure .
So what does this have to do with Newt ?
The basic issues here are trust , intelligence , national security and economic recovery .
Newt 's relations with women are at best reprehensible .
If it were a matter of him vs someone equally intelligent and less of a cad I would gleefully go for the other option .
however , there is no drama that he was involved with Anna Chapman or any other honey pot involved with Russian or US mafias .
He does have lots of really interesting ideas about the economy and the US 's relations with the rest of the world that are worth listening to .
( But his actual record vis a vis Israel and the Global Warming hoax show he also has pretty bad ideas as well )
So on balance , I have to say that given a choice between Romney and Romney care and Newt and his affection for all his weird baggage with PBS , Global Warming , playing footsie with various flaky arab regimes @...
I prefer Santorum .
But Newt 's conjugal craziness is not part of my decision tree .
Well said .
I for one am getting weary of so called "@ dirt @" being dug up on candidates private sexual lives from one decade ago let alone many decades ago .
And it 's actually becoming pitiful to watch the political press become TMZ with old bitter women who have an axe to grind .
Clinton was n't impeached for sex , but for lying .
He was disbarred for lying .
The bar for democrats is pretty low .
What they have to overcome is that even though Bill Clinton was a world class wife cheater , and a liar , he was still a fairly effective president .
His personal difficulties of keeping his privates in his pants did n't make him a bad president .
There is the democrat quandry .
There is nothing weird about it .
It 's the good old double standard .
Clinton was n't just a philanderer , he was a world class sexual pervert enabled by his wife who is now the secretary of state .
And Clinton had a string of women going all the way back to Paula Jones , when he was governor and then a long relationship with Gennifer Flowers and others and all before he was president , I think .
The public knew of these women and so did Hillary , and Bill Clinton still became president , and continued with his follies until he was impeached .
I do n't feel that any of his infideliities made him a lesser president .
In fact , I think they helped .
He was a good looking man with power and lust for young beautiful women , and it all worked well for him , until it did n't .
Newt is a changed man and I do n't believe he would ever be a serial womanizer .
He has been married since 2000 to Calista , and had a relationship with her for 6 years prior .
It will be interesting to see how it all plays out .
But Newt knew this would come up , before he tossed his hat in the ring , and I am sure he will be a better man regardless of how it ends .
I do n't think Newt 's sex life is relevant , and I do n't care about Bill Clinton 's blow job either .
Say what you want but the only reason he was even put into the position for lying is that the puritanical neo @-@ cons were chasing down sex rumors ( and spending millions of taxpayer dollars in the process ) .
And Newt was one of them leading the charge .
So when someone says , "@ It was n't about the blowjob , it was about lying @" , it was about the blowjob .
Actually , I think your instance on it being the blow job is the it was all about states rights rather than slavery deal .
And hypocrisy in politics is not that big a deal either .
All the efforts and bribes etc. etc. were to avoid the loss of the civil rights case .
It was n't just the issue of he got a blow job from a dim intern .
It was that you got your job by going down .
do we really want government officials appointed on the casting couch ?
And if you said no , then you were out of a job .
Blow job or no job .
And the man was a feminist icon .
What kind of feminism is that that promotes that kind of employment '@ opportunity .
If you can swallow that it was '@ just a blow job @' than you swallow everything .
Now , fellatio aside , did Clinton 's tomcatting gett in the way of his job ?
By all accounts , he was good at multitasking .
Is this really all that relavent to his job performance ?
Now if you could find proof that he was sleeping with someone from the Mafia or the KGB , that would be interesting sexual exchanges .
Or that he was sleeping with lobbyist as payment for legislation , that would be interesting and worthwhile to discuss .
The Cons can say what they want but yes , it was about the blowjob .
And now they want to turn a blind eye to Newt 's philandering and desire for an open marriage ?
Pure hypocrisy .
Telling yourself that it was about the blow job allows you to howl hypocrisy .
Facing the truth of the matter , that he treated women like dirt and that if a woman had the courage to say no to him she had better shop the resume is beyond you .
But we still face the question of what is more important to us as citizens .
Voting for incompetent and uxorious like Carter and Obama , or voting for comptent slime like Clinton and Gringrich .
I 'm in a bit of a quandary on this one .
Fundamentally , everyone is entitled to a private life and - no matter who they are - they have a right not to have their personal life dragged through the mud for political point scoring or for the general consumption of the public .
Having said that , I do feel that @...
if one is capable of treating one 's own family so badly , or one breaks the vows of marriage @...
then why should I trust that person to take their oath of office seriously ?
If people cheat on their life partner , they are unlikely to treat anyone else any better .
And for me is that I could not care less if a man has a girlfriend on the side or 100 girlfriends ( or even boyfriends ) on the side .
I never did care .
None of that , to me , translates into his ability to do the right things in office and it never has .
But for years all we ever heard about was Clinton 's morals and now it seems that all of the sudden morals do n't matter .
There 's a lot of inconsistency on this one and I have no problem pointing it out .
Obviously to the voters it did n't matter .
Fully aware of Gennifer flowers millions voted for him anyway .
If you want to play this game , if it did n't matter than , it does n't matter now .
You can n't play the game of "@ I did n't think it mattered then , but now I do . @"
So you think everyone just lies to you or that we are all just so confused we can n't fathom what our reasons are for wanting Clinton impeached ?
lol
Yeah , its a classic libtard dodge , is n't it ?
Make up what you think your opponents *@ really @* mean and then slam them for it .
We critisize Clinton for being a philanderer who used his power to get sex and the libtards just assume that we really do n't have a problem with that but it *@ must @* be something else .
Wonder why that is ?
The fact is that some of the best leaders throughout history have been philandering drunkards .
When you need a leader , you can be forgiven for over @-@ looking a few things .
Rape is n't one of them .
So , i guess the population of divorced people should n't qualify for office .
After all , they could n't keep their vows for life .
This is the type of politics Newt , himself , founded .
He 's got a huge set of balls to complain about it now .
Seriously .
Well said @.......
You must spread some Reputation around before giving it to Sallow again .
Soooooo @..........
First of all it was about the blowjob .
Then it was about the lying .
Now what is it ?
Lying about the blowjob .
Denying that is like a redneck denying the Civil War was about slavery .
Not to change the subject ; but the Civil War was about "@ States Rights @" and not slavery .
The States @' right to have slaves .
It 's in each and every one of the Confederate states @' constitutions .
Problem is clinton did something no other president did , he violated the oval office by having sex thaere and then lying about it .
You did not mention that why ?
Problem no. 2 , people want to hang Newt out to dry but still kiss old mr. monicas behind .
Ok @.....
now we 're back to the blowjob again .
I wish you bastards would make up your mind .
Actually it was about states rights to have slavery .
Slavery was the reason the states wanted to have states rights .
"@ founded @" ?
You really think he pioneered this kind of politics ?
History as taught and learned by the left wing propagandists will likely be kind to President Obama .
But if they were honest and objective , they would n't be .
This is part of why stooges like you can not see even a glimmer of reality .
So you agree that if only 10 % of what hacks like you say were true then our wonderful country would have folded in 1777 ?
Or did I confuse you with someone with a different critical thinking skill set ?
No , moron .
Unlike idiots like you , I do n't subscribe to the positively retarded notion that those who disagree with chumps like you are "@ hacks . @"
I read the drivel bullshit spew you posted .
Ergo , it is clear that it is you who are the hack .
And no .
The Country did well in terms of setting the foundation for what has lasted so far almost 240 years BECAUSE they subscribed to the things I believe and those whom morons like YOU consider "@ hacks @" believe .
You would n't RECOGNIZE a critical thinking skill set , ya dickweed .
You 'd have to be able to think on your own .
Clearly , you can n't .
My , my . This is a positive thread about the Prez as some here said never happens and bam , the idiots show up and try and make it about themselves and how they view their perceived terribleness of '@ Murica .
For shame , for shame .
Like I said earlier , if only 10 % of the horseshit you rightwing bitches said were true then our wonderful country would have folded like a cheap suit in or about 1777 .
I sometimes wonder if when Pelosi and Reid took over Congress and spent most of their time investigating and undermining Bush that they also purposefully took their eye 's off the ball and the growing economic problems of the country .
How could they miss the inevitable housing bubble that most Americans suspected all along , given that they were directly responsible and had the inside scoop for instance ?
Bush warned them several times but they refused to act @...
mmm
If Reid and Pelosi had actually investigated gwb as you claim and I wished then he and many of his administration and other war criminals would now be in prison .
Another oddity with Pelosi & Reid is the unemployment figures , after 1 year of Democrat control and the last of the Republican budgets past away , the unemployment figures started growing precipitously .
I suppose it 's against the rules for Democrats to question these things @...
I understand just blaming Bush is the simplest of answers , no thought required @...
ergo the Obama / Democrat / liberal press excuses @...
Had it been any one of those other palookas , say , Cain 'n' Palin the country would have been in shambles .
Obama has pulled the country back from the brink of disaster that Bush 'n' Cheney had left it in .
He 's created ObamaCare , because , as we all know , Obama cares .
He 's brought dignity back to the Office .
The economy has been steadily ticking up .
He saved GM @...
a WHOPPING success .
He got Bin Laden from a place that Bush did n't dare to go into .
Khaddaffi 's gone .
Pirates of the seas know they can n't '@ EFF around with Americans or any of their properties .
He helped to liberate a country from a tyrant w/o spending too much time , money and with no casualties .
The rest of the world knows the same .
Although he 's not going around screaming about how big 'n' tuff '@ Murrka is .
He 's pulling us out of war .
And , once again , the economy continues to tick up , despite his opponents in the GOP 's efforts to undermine him at every .
single .
turn .
Yeah @...
I 'd say Obama 's a shoe @-@ in for the next election .
Not to mention , History is going to be VERY kind to Obama @...
unlike the last guy .
So your standards are still pretty low ?
Next chance you get , look in the mirror and repeat this 100 times @...
"@ I need to stop getting my info from Lawrence , Rachel , Ed & Keith @" @...
They did a lot , too .
Reid and Pelosi , but right now this thread is about the tremendous attributes of the current POTUS Barack Hussein Obama .
Take your whine to another thread that might offer more cheese to your mousey mouth .
and oh by the way @..
over Bush 's 8 years of the Presidency he saved well over 200 million jobs .
I figure my guess is at least as reputable as the Obama 's toadies @..
The idiots , dope , are the obamawannablowhim tube steaks , like you , who see no wrong in that imbecile .
As President , he sucks .
It is because of leftwing goobers like you that we are in danger of losing our Republic .
Adherents of the system crafted for us by the Framers and the Founders -- that is , the conservatives -- are the bulwark AGAINST the idiocy of schmucks , like you , who would have cost us the Republic by now if you had been given your desires .
I have a history of giving due credit to President Obama for the few things he has done right .
Assholes such as you are utterly unable to admit how bad he is , however , in light of all he has done so terribly .
You are laughable .
And you smell like a sock .
I think of you , nowadays , as a brother , Marc !
But you 're kinda like the crazy uncle .
President Obama is doing a bang up job .
You funny !
Hehehe @...
come on @...
you know I 'm right .
Say it .
The Worst Economic Recovery Since The Great Depression
The record of President Obama ’s first three years in office is in , and nothing that happens now can go back and change that .
What that record shows is that President Obama , with his throwback , old @-@ fashioned , 1970 s Keynesian economics , has put America through the worst recovery from a recession since the Great Depression .
The recession started in December , 2007 .
Go to the website of the National Bureau of Economic Research ( <a href="http://www.nber.org"> The National Bureau of Economic Research </a> ) to see the complete history of America ’s recessions .
What that history reveals is that before this last recession , since the Great Depression recessions in America have lasted an average of 10 months , with the longest previously lasting 16 months .
When President Obama entered office in January , 2009 , the recession was already in its 13 th month .
His responsibility was to manage a timely , robust recovery to get America back on track again .
Based on the historical record , that recovery was imminent , within a couple of months or so .
Despite widespread fear , nothing fundamental had changed to deprive America of the long term , world @-@ leading prosperity it had enjoyed going back 300 years .
Supposedly a forward looking progressive , Obama proved to be America ’s first backward looking regressive .
His first act was to increase federal borrowing , the national debt and the deficit by nearly a trillion dollars to finance a supposed “@ stimulus @” package , based on the discredited Keynesian theory left for dead 30 years ago holding that increased government spending , deficits and debt are what promote economic growth and recovery .
That theory arose in the 1930 s as the answer to the Great Depression , which , of course , never worked .
That was the beginning of President Obama ’s Rip Van Winkle act , pretending not to know anything that happened over the previous 30 years proving the dramatic , historic success of the new , more modern , supply side economics , which holds that incentives for increased production are what promote economic growth and recovery .
Indeed , that Rip Van Winklism pretended not to remember the 1970 s either , when double digit inflation and double digit unemployment proved Keynesian economics grievously wrong .
As should have been long expected , Obama ’s trillion dollar Keynesian stimulus did nothing to promote recovery and growth , and almost surely delayed it .
That is because borrowing a trillion dollars out of the economy to spend a trillion back into it does nothing to promote the economy on net .
Indeed , it is probably a net drag on the economy , because the private sector spends the money more productively and efficiently than the public sector .
The National Bureau of Economic Research scored the recession as ending in June , 2009 .
Yet , today , in the 49 th month since the recession started , there has still been no real recovery , like recoveries from previous recessions in America .
Unemployment actually rose after June , 2009 , and did not fall back down below that level until 18 months later in December , 2010 .
Instead of a recovery , America has suffered the longest period of unemployment near 9 % or above since the Great Depression , under President Obama ’s public policy malpractice .
Even today , 49 months after the recession started , the U6 unemployment rate counting the unemployed , underemployed and discouraged workers is still 15.2 % .
And that does n’t include all the workers who have fled the workforce under Obama ’s economic oppression .
The unemployment rate with the full measure of discouraged workers is reported at <a href="http://www.shadowstats.com"> Shadow Government Statistics : Home Page </a> as about 23 % , which is depression level unemployment .
Today , over 4 years since the recession started , there are still almost 25 million Americans unemployed or underemployed .
That includes 5.6 million who are long-term unemployed for 27 weeks , or more than 6 months .
Under President Obama , America has suffered the longest period with so many in such long-term unemployment since the Great Depression .
Notably , blacks have been suffering another depression under Obama , with unemployment today , 49 months after the recession started , still at 15.8 % .
Black unemployment has been over 15 % for 2 ½ years under Obama .
Black teenage unemployment today is over 40 % , where it has persisted for over 2 years as well .

Well @..
I 'm crushed @....
but hardly surprised @...
Sorry , liar , but the case that was brought and won against the NBP was DISMISSED by the direct orders of the RACIST Eric Holder .
The Bush administration ’s Justice Department — not the Obama administration — made the decision not to pursue criminal charges against members of the New Black Panther Party for alleged voter intimidation at a polling center in Philadelphia in 2008
You mad ?
Nope , sorry , liar @...
You a dumbass @...
The U.S. Department of Justice seal bears a Latin phrase @: "@ Qui Pro Domina Justitia Sequitur . @"
The motto refers to the attorney general , "@ who prosecutes on behalf of Lady Justice . @"
But under President Barack Obama 's politically corrupt DOJ , Lady Justice is getting the shaft .
To wit @: Let 's examine the uproar over Attorney General Eric Holder 's decision to protect hate @-@ mongering thugs who harassed and bullied precinct workers and voters on Election Day in Philadelphia .
Oh , wait .
There 's been no uproar .
Let me tell you why .
Two weeks ago , in a highly unusual move , Holder dismissed default judgments his department had won against two of three defendants charged with violating the Voting Rights Act .
On Nov. 4 , 2008 , a billy club @-@ wielding militant in military @-@ style boots and beret stood outside a Philly polling location with a similarly dressed partner .

Yeah .
You pretty much stunk up the place with that one , Dave .
You really take criticism of Dear Reader personally , do n't you ?
Another one that 's been around the internet several times .
Come on Dave , if you 've gotta be combative on message boards , at least be funny about it .
I must have missed the part in the TOS where I 'm supposed to entertain people whose idea of humor is a Hitler mustache on a picture of Bush .
It 's coolest to be submissive Dave , do n't question Democrat authority @..

Silly me .
I 'm kinda used to being a citizen .
Not real interested in being a subject .
No , no , hell no .
Democrats and other progressively oriented voters are CORRECT without question .
That is an observable , measurable and well documented fact .
Live with it or go find you a rightwing country where you might proliferate yourself a bit better .
This country was founded on tolerance , diversity , charity , education , the betterment of a desperate but faithful and patriotic society and all other considerations now referred to as liberal @-@ isms .
We are certainly a far better country and society than what I see mostly posting around here condemning everything from the President to the smell of their own farts .
You turnip green eating sonofabitches need to get some lessons on American history and foundational principles .
Interesting version of "@ tolerance @" @: "@ Immediately and unquestioningly agree with everything I say or get out !! @"

What do you expect from someone who has a picture of a big , dumb looking guy as an avatar ?

The Bush DoJ had already won their civil case against the NBP . The Obama DoJ dropped the suit .

Bang up ?
I guess you 're kinda right @....
the U.S. is basically imploding .
Does that mean we are supposed to swallow rotten tripe just because someone is using it to say something nice about the President / If I posted a thread talking about how wonderful it is that Bush got bin Laden would you let it go simply because it is positive , or would you call me for distorting facts ?
Do you actually have a brain ?
this one here gets me @...
lets see , Bush had 9 / 11 to deal with but yet it 's the Obama who history is going to bestow sainthood on @..
that what I 'm talking about Obamabots and Jonestown @..
You know why SteffyWeffie @...
because Bush CHOSE to squander it .
He had the ENTIRE country behind him right after 9 / 11 , the Right , the Left , and the Center .
Howevr , Bush CHOSE to dismantle The Constitution and institute his OWN demented far RW and totalitarian policies .
There were no weapons of mass destruction .
Iraq had NOTHING to do with 9 / 11 .
Neither did Saddam .
He CHOSE to KEEP the country in a CONSTANT state of fear to blunt their thinking .
He BULLIED the Press , for which I blame mostly the Press for for not pushing back .
He ERODED our freedoms .
All the things you guys CLAIM to be so pissed at Obama for @...
were INSTITUTED under Bush .
I did n't even mention tortured people .
Bush was and is an unmitigated .
royal .
disaster .
History WILL bare that out .
holy smoke , you should sit here and preach about Bush dismantling the Constitution @...
DO you say that about the Dear Leader today ?
Everyone else thinks so but you 40 % who still approve of him @...
so lets get real dear @..
Bush INSTITUTED it sweetheart @...
what did you , or do you think about that ?
He STARTED the dismantling of the Constitution .
What say you ?
And Obama 's continuing it .
But do n't you DARE criticize Dear Reader .
Where 's YOUR criticism of Shrub twinkle toes ?
I 've criticized him many times , for not wielding his veto pen nearly enough , for not fighting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan aggressively enough , and for spending money like a drunken Democrat .
Where 's your criticism of SCOAMF ?
If Bush started it how do you explain Clinton bombing Kosovo if Bush was the first president to ignore the constitution ?
I was pretty pissed he did n't put up Public Option , he did n't fight hard enough for Health Care Reform .
I think he gave and gives the Republicans too much leeway , in other words he does n't fight then nearly enough .
He agrees with them too much .
He did n't shut down gitmo .
However , I temper that with the realization that said Republicans are fighting him tooth and nail on everything .
awww poor poor Obama , those meanie Republicans are standing in your way of greatness @..
those in the 40 approval thinks so anyway

You just make sure you keep blaming Republicans .
Do n't hold Dear Reader accountable for anything .

Turned Clinton from a deficit spending President in a fortunate economy to a budget surplus and Democrat pro @-@ sexual harassment hero @..
Soo @..
what 's your beef with this Guy @...@ ?
I have no beef with him .
At least he told the truth and said that the budget was BALANCED during Bill Clinton 's presidency .
Clinton never balanced the budget .
The only thing he balanced was interns .
And who forced it ?
It was n't Clinton .
Yup @..
Clinton went along with it kicking and screaming but then experienced that typical Democratic long term / short term memory loss and took full credit @..
You know what I love about nutters ?
They are not hypocitical at all .
They are always consistent @....
always .
Yeah , I think Newt should win the primary .
No really .
Wait .
Where 's your copy paste on this issue ?
Indeed @...
and in his re @-@ election Bid ?
Clinton was forced to do the Potamic Two @-@ step Electric Slide to the center like a good politician .
Wha @....
You learned to read ????
My main beef is his hypocrisy going after Clinton for an affair .
I do n't trust him to put the nation before politics .
I have no rep left but I have 1 vote .
And Newt will get it .
Wut ?
Do you really believe that is what prompted the investigation ?
Do n't have one .
He 's already my choice , assuming he 's still in by the time my state 's primary rolls around .
In the primary my vote will go to Newt .
That is who I think that can kick Obama 's ass in a debate and an election
More importantly ( if not more urgently ) , I think his plans for getting our country out of the mess it 's in are really good .
I did n't realize Bill Clinton was impeached for adultery ?
I thought it was because he lied to a grand jury and used his office to influence others to lie ?
Amazing what you can learn on the internet
Technically , you are right .
Practically , nobody cared .
Because every MAN in this country would have told the exact same lie if asked .
People forgave Clinton for the lying because the question never should have been asked in the first place .
Just like they thought the "@ hi @-@ tech @" lynching of Clarance Thomas was wrong 7 years earlier .
Interrogating people about their sex lives is n't @' kosher to a lot of people .
Now , in the interest of complete fairness , Clinton brought most of his troubles down on himself .
He should have settled with Paula Jones years earlier .
And he got a whole lot of millage out of sexual harassment BS at the time of the Thomas hearings .
But all the real damage was done when Lewinsky 's name came out .
By pressing the issue , the Republicans made themselves look bad .
I find it interesting that you probscribe your personal values to "@ practically @" everybody .
I would suggest that a few more than "@ nobody @" cared .
Using executive privelege to lure women into sexual relationships is at best , sleazy @...
At worst , corrupt .
Maybe a few of the problems in this country are caused by people who give a pass to the sleazy and corrupt ?
If a BJ was the biggest concern of the nation with the president right now @-@ the whole country would be a lot better .
I mean seriously Clinton was 100 X better than W. Bush and Obama .
You 're also VERY naive if you think any modern president is n't / was n't corrupt .
They all are / were on some level .
PS @-@ Nice icon !
\m/
Back to my boy , Newt .
I LOVE hearing him talk in these debates .
He makes the other candidates sound like a bunch of kids squabbling over the last Popsicle .
Check out the way Newt discussed Herman Cain 's 999 plan .
He started by commending and complimenting Cain , and then raised objections to the plan without ONCE denigrating Cain , or even sounding like he was denigrating the plan .
He sounds so statesmanlike .
I 've been following his website postings about the legislation he would propose as President .
It 's really good , and quite innovative in places .
And I like his plan for his first Executive Order as President to be abolishing all "@ czars @" in the federal government .
You like intelligence and a President who speaks in full sentences ?
We agree .
But @.....
then you say you like the plan to abolish czars .
Do n't you know that this is just a piece of grandstanding nonsense ?
You like intelligence and good speaking ?
I had n't noticed , given your election of Barack Oteleprompter .
What I know about abolishing the czars is that they 're Unconstitutional and have no business having power in our federal government , and thus , I know that it 's an excellent idea to return that power to the people duly elected or appointed in accordance with law .
But as I mentioned earlier , I realize that laws are just suggestions to be ignored at will to leftists , so I do n't expect you to understand why they 're so important to the rest of us .
Newt Gingrich @: 2012 Campaign Staff Exodus Makes Me '@ Feel Liberated @' · 06 / 15 / 11
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said during an appearance on Fox News on Tuesday night that he feels "@ liberated @" by the mass exodus of staffers from his presidential campaign .
Last week , news of aides jumping ship from the Gingrich 2012 political operation sent shockwaves across the political spectrum .
Campaign manager Rob Johnson and spokesman Rick Tyler were just two of numerous members of the presidential candidate 's team to resign .

When "@ the best debater @" and "@ most informed candidate @" can n't even convince his own campaign manager and spokesman to stay with his campaign at this early date - then something is definitely wrong !
When a mass exodus of staffers makes a presidential candidate feel "@ liberated @" - then someone is out of touch with reality and my money is on the Newt !
Huffington Post ?
Puhleeze .
I would have explained what happened to you if you had n't proven yourself to be a braindead twink who 's incapable of finding the truth , let alone comprehending it .
Dismissed .
Move along .
In addition to the adultery ?
Newt is one of those guys who says he loves America but seems to hate Americans .
In the 1990 's there was a news story about a woman whose baby was cut out of her belly .
The rest of us were recoiling at the horror of people , individuals , who could do that .
Newt was pontificating about the seething underbelly of the welfare society .
Newt has no heart .
He has a brain and a weenie .
And the weenie obviously overrules the brain more often than it should .
At least that 's how he comes across often , and that 's baggage .
I 'm not his wife , and I 'm not looking to date him , so I really do n't consider his marital relationships , past or present , to be any of my business .
And I really do n't think now is the time to be quibbling about trivial bullshit .
Our nation is in trouble , and to be blunt , I think anyone who 's worried about "@ he 's not a very nice or likable guy @" at a time like this deserves to have their nation fall apart around them .
Now , show me evidence that Mr. Gingrich violated the law , a la former President Horndog , and we 'll talk .
You 're pointing at the marital infidelity side of the equation and poopooing us holding that against him .
Republicans do n't get to poopoo that .
We 've let the religious right carry the torch for us for so long that we are the preacher party .
Democrats can cheat and not destroy their party .
But if we cheat , we 're hypocrites .
You might not think it 's fair or smart , but that 's how it is .
Newt burned his morality card and that 's baggage .
But for me it 's way more than the adultery .
It 's his hatefulness and lack of empathy .
That 's more than not being "@ likable @" .
When a woman is murdered in a heinous way , you give condolences to her family .
You do n't start hurling around bullshit about the welfare state .
Back during the ground zero mosque upheaval he said something else which showed me that he had n't learned his lesson , and which can be held against him in soundbites and on a deeper level .
I do n't remember the details and am not going to look it up at this time .
I do n't need to now because he 's not a contender so I do n't have to worry about him .
Newt burnt his bridges with me long ago and I 'm glad he 's not a contender now .
What makes you think I 'm a Republican ?
Furthermore , please refer back to what I said earlier @: if you 're worried about his personality at a time like this , you deserve to have your country fall apart around you .
You asked about baggage .
You do n't get to define the terms about what should or should not be baggage and say "@ we 'll talk @" as if your terms make the baggage no more .
Baggage IS , whether you think it is logical or not .
And Gingrich has it .
Yes , because there are a lot of shallow halfwits in this country who 've been weaned on The National Inquirer and now do n't seem to know how to differentiate between politicians and celebrities and set priorities when it comes to elections .
I do n't get to tell you what inane bullshit you can or can n't value over little things like issues , positions , and plans , but I sure as hell DO get to tell you that your "@ baggage @" is a load of crap if that 's what I think .
And I do .
So again , feel free to vote for the person who seems warm and fuzzy to you , but do n't even consider coming in here and bitching about the problems in this country afterward .
Your response is going to be , "@ But I 'm sure he sends his condolences for your suffering , and that 's all you cared about , is n't it ? @"
Myself , I 'd rather have a coldhearted bastard who can fix our problems than a nice , likable person who sympathizes with them .
You asked about the baggage .
I noted some of it .
You can deny it all you want , but it exists .
Newt is not a viable candidate .
That 's the bottom line .
I can n't believe that the truth is so new to you , Cecille .
Newt 's behaviors have been documented for decades .

Of course , they were n’t .
In April 1980 , only one day after Jackie ’s surgery , Newt went to her room to present her with the terms of the divorce .
That summer , he introduced Marianne to his parents , according to Esquire .
By October , he was already refusing to pay alimony or child support .
Marianne admits she knew little of that at first .

His campaign staff has stated that Newt carried out multiple affairs during this time .
After a successful 1978 campaign , Congressman Gingrich moved to D.C.
In 1980 , Newt began a relationship with a woman he met at a political fundraiser , Marianne .
Newt divorced Jackie in February of 1981 and married Marianne in August .
Congressman Gingrich was accused of negotiating divorce details while his wife was recovering from surgery , and then refusing to pay child support and alimony to speed up the divorce process .

Do n't bother .
They live in an alternate reality that can not be changed by the real world .
She acts like she had no idea who she was praising .
If they want to run Newt , I think that would be great .
For them , and for the country .
The Week ?
Muckraker ?
His ex @-@ wife ? !
Thanks for proving my point about you being an ignorant shitstain too lazy to think and separate rumor from reality .
Because EVERY intelligent person looks to a man 's EX @-@ WIFE for "@ the truth @" about him .
Sure they do .
Sit down and shut the fuck up before you humiliate yourself further , fucktard .
Well , I 'm sure he would n't get the ignorant shitstain vote .
On the other hand , I do n't think he wants it .
Denial is not just a river in Egypt .
That 's not just from the ex @-@ wife .
It 's from people who worked with him .
Newt has admitted to most of what you would deny .
And he came up with a wacky excuse for it .
He just loved the country too much .
Newt is not stable .
His personal life aside @--@ that is only fair since apparently only Republicans are fair game to have their personal lives closely scrutinized and criticized @--@ Newt is by far the best educated , has the highest IQ , and the most impressive knowledge , recall ability , and vision of any of the candidates running this year .
In his professional life he has pulled two major blunders .
One was in taking on the dishonest and corrupt James Wright and forcing his resignation over a book deal in the Reagan Administration and then writing his own book which of course triggered the same kinds of accusations .
Hypocrisy is allowed on the left , but is not to be tolerated on the right .
The second was the same sort of thing when he imprudently forced the impeachment of President Clinton on grounds that most of us did n't think rose the the level of high crimes and misdemeanors .
Those grounds had nothing to do with Monica Lewinsky , but the left , having a less sophisticated constituency , was able to make it look like it did and then could trash Newt from engaging in his own infidelity .
More hypocrisy that is allowed on the left , but is not to be tolerated on the right .
Can Newt live down that kind of baggage in a head to head contest with Barack Obama ?
Given that the MSM will play up all of Newt 's baggage while continuing to ignore Obama 's , I do n't know .
Newt right now is not my favorite of the candidates , but I would n't have to hold my nose to vote for him a year from November , and he would be heads and shoulders above the current occupant of the White House .
He 's also just about as big a bigot and racist as Pat Buchanan .
Who 's also very smart and savvy .
You really believe that the impeachment was on solid ground ?
No .
As I said Clinton was absolutely guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice to the detriment of a private citizen and that is indefensible and was enough to get him suspended from the bar in the Supreme Court , in Arkansas , and charged with contempt of court in New York .
But it did not , in my opinion , rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors that justified impeachment .
The Senate seemed to be of that same opinion as , even though Republican controlled , chose not to convict him and force him out of office .
Yeah @..
like you guys really care about that shit .
Both Reagan and Bush II "@ perjured @" themselves in much bigger ways @..
people got killed .
I 'm sure in your mind he is Sallow .
Most leftists buy into all the hate stuff put out there on somebody like Newt .
I have not seen any bigotry or racism in Gingrich however , nor in Buchanan for that matter @--@ Buchanan has been right on the edge of anti @-@ semitism a time or two however @--@ but both have focused mostly on the truth of the human condition which , to the left , is not allowed in our politically correct world .
Clintons transgressions appear to be forgiven by the left .
Aw whats a little obstruction of justice and perjury .
Jeeze the guy was only a sitting POTUS .
As for Newt well lets get out the tar and feathers .
Newt the smartest guy in the room and is way more competant that the joker sitting in the oval office right now .
Of course I would be very surprised if the got the nomination even though he is way more than able .
PB is not on the edge , he 's a white supremacist .
Newt 's just an opportunistic asshole .
Oh gosh , really ?
And you write for a newspaper or something like that ?
Bigotry is holding that one 's culture or religion is superior to others and racism is holding that one 's race is superior to others .
Both Newt and Pat have commented and wrote about the superiority of the west , Christainity and the white race .
Google is your friend .
What "@ transgressions @" ?
Clinton got a blowjob .
That 's it .
Reagan made a deal with Iran to get elected and funded terrorists that raped and killed American nuns .
Bush II lied about Iraq .
And completely lied about it .
Killed thousands .
Those are REAL transgression .
Nothing will happen to either man .
I am aware of the slant that people like you put on it .
I have also read what both have written on the subject .
And your take is mean spirited and based on the leftist political correct notion that the white race or the American / European culture is NEVER to be recognized for any accomplishments and anyone who presumes to do so shall be branded white supremacist and / or racist .
Ability to analyze content critically , reading comprehension , and honest critique would be your friend if you would allow it to be .
There 's nothing wrong with regonizing the accomplishments of cultures .
Absolutely nothing .
But when you start saying they are superior to others @..
you get into some really dodgy terroritory .
Please take your own advice .
I 'm not viewing PB with any slant .
I 'm reading what he says .
He 's a racist and anti @-@ Semite .
He says we should have sided with Hitler .
He questions the Holocaust .
He says that we need white people in power or the culture will fall .
As for PC , you 're setting up a straw man .
Your claim is not even close to mainstream liberal , left , or Democratic rhetoric .
I challenge you to prove that with ANY quotation IN CONTEXT from either of them .
MAY @: Trump is gonna kick Obama 's ass !
JULY @: Bachmann is gonna kick Obama 's ass !
SEPTEMBER @: Perry is gonna kick Obama 's ass !
OCTOBER @: Cain is gonna kick Obama 's ass !

If Santorum can just hold out a while longer , he 'll be kicking Obama 's ass , too !

PHEAR THE PHRED !!!!!!
Do n't ya just love the chest thumpers ?
Yup !
And I love saving their posts and rubbing them in their face down the road .
The transgressions I was referring to were Obstruction of Justice and Perjury .
This guy was a sitting POTUS .
Do n't know about you but I expect a bit more from the supreme leader of America .
As for his blowjob ?
I could care if he blew every intern in DC .
Clintons morals or lack thereof do n't bother me one bit .
Just as Newts do n't .
Clintons not the first Prez nor will he be the last to chase skirts .
Or blowjobs .

Legally .
Yes .
Clinton broke several federal statues .
People have gone to prison and lost their jobs for a lot less .
Politically .
Not so much .
He was still popular and the country was willing to forgive him and frankly , his being acquitted was a forgone conclusion .
If he had Obama 's economic numbers , he 'd have been run out on a rail .
The millage that could have been gotten out of it was gotten when Ken Starr nailed down that he lied .
They should have censured him and left it at that .
Oh gosh .
But I agree with your conclusion .
no , YOU made the accusation that the quotes are racist or bigoted .
So YOU put them INTO CONTEXT and justify your opinion that they are racist or bigoted .
Sallow did not do that with the highly biased and bigoted links he posted .
They are in context .
[ · Exactly .
Sexual harassment lawsuits from malingerers cost $$$$ .
That 's part of the equation .
Glad you are finally getting it , I was beginning to think you were stupid .
Oh , give it up .
They go for very cheap labor .
Yeah , I 'm sure that includes getting sexual favors for free from workers , but that 's just a bonus .
You can go there and accuse all the women you like of putting pubic hairs on your coke can , and then carry on about how they should grow up .
But she got millions AFTER she stuck the knife in . Amazing .
Are you gifting her with psychic abilities ?
All she got at the time was trouble and humiliation , and the possible permanent loss of employment in her chosen field .
She took the risk because she had no choice .
And somehow , you put that on her .
Which is crazy .
Then they should stop whining about it .
Actually , no one believes them because they usually end up suing for bullshit .
Frankly , never saw a SH case brought that was n't complete BS , but good people got fired for petty BS because HR departments are running scared .
True , they later find ways of getting rid of the malingerers , because that 's just a bomb waiting to go off .
You poor thing .
Being that you were completely wrong on the last three , and wrong on Hill being a · Again , you ignored the issue .
Obama called his grandmother a racist on national TV because he could n't bring himself to denounce the nasty , anti @-@ American racist bile pouring out of the mouth of his pastor .
The woman who raised him when his parents could n't be bothered .
Seems a lot worse than getting divorces from marriages that are n't working to me .
Absolutely not .
Obama made a point that went way over your head .
The point that we all have racial bias that slips through at times .
All of us .
Every one of us .
To be a racist is a far more concentrated effort .
Joe , the links about Newt are in an earlier thread .
READ THEM .
You 'll find out about the child support , and the tendency to dump wives when they get sick , and the serial adultery .
But you 're right , the second wife was a lobbyist .
Now go read the rest .
Thanks .
Well , I did .
Far left kook websites letting an jilted ex @-@ wife break bad do n't count .
And you did get the facts wrong about so many other things @....
And you got one wrong AGAIN ( bolded ) > Callista is the THIRD wife , not the second @...
Again , do you bother to do ANY research before wasting my valuable time ?
Get your FACTS right before you shoot off your mouth .
no .
he did n't violate federal statues .
everyone lies about cheating when their wife is in the room .
kenny starr spent 70 million of our tax money for a blue dress .
And Republicans across the country are wasting millions upon millions enacting laws that they KNOW are not Constitutional and will get struck down , like drug testing in order to get assistance , and voter disenfranchisement .
Wingnuts love to waste taxpayer money .
Can n't blame Ken Starr .
He did exactly what the IC statue is designed to do .
Keep investigating until you get someone for something .
That 's why it was an awful law when designed , because it created guys like Starr , Lawrence Walsh , Patrick Fitzgerald , fanatics redoubling their efforts while losing sight of their goals .
And the federal perjury statues do not have a "@ you can lie if your wife is in the room and will brain you with an ashtray when you get home @" exception .
Which is exactly the beauty of Sexual Harassment lawsuits .
You can be totally innocent of whatever you are accused of , but they can drag in every ex @-@ girlfriend , co @-@ worker , casual acquaintance etc. , and who knows what you 'll have to answer for ?
Which is why most companies fire the accused without hearing and settle .
Then fire the accuser if she does n't have the good sense to move on .
So , Starr was a fanatic who lost sight of his goals , but we can n't blame him ?
Perhaps you 'd like to show me where Newt admitted to anything other than having an affair on his second wife .
See if you can do it using REAL news sources , rather than blogs .
Amazingly enough , just because someone says it on the Internet , that does n't make it true .
That 's cool .
I just hope every Republican feels that way .
Oh , I 'm pretty sure most Republicans do n't want the ignorant shitstain vote .
And , after all , we 're pretty used to you voting Democrat , anyway .
Of course , what you WILL N'T find is any sort of real source that anyone who is n't a three @-@ toothed , Art Bell @-@ listening moron would waste time reading , let alone believing and citing to other people as though it means something .
I 'm just waiting for this Deliverance reject to quote us The Weekly World News .
What you find contemptible about her is that she accused a conservative .
No , what I find contemptable is that she used this guy to advance herself , and then stabbed him in the back when that was advantageous .
It lacks honor and decency .
That goes beyond partisanship .
Ask some of the RW people about me .
Half of them think I 'm a liberal because I do n't toe the idealogical line .
I 'm just as critical of Republicans and Democrats @- when they deserve it .
No , and neither do you .
The comparison is stupid , and again , you 're crediting her with psychic abilities , along with the ability to make herself get subpoenaed .
Well , if she said , "@ Clarance , Great Guy @" like everyone else who was asked about Judge Thomas by the FBI , she would n't have gotten supeoned .
Instead she said , "@ Ummm , he said something bad once , what a bad guy @...
you are n't going to put my name to this , are you ?
I might need another letter of recommendation . @"

Then they get angry over being investigated so they investigate a land deal and a blow job for revenge .
Actually , going back to your psychic powers bullshit , how did those mean old Republcans actually make Clinton lie ?
Here 's how Clinton could have avoided problems .
"@ Did you get a blow job from Monica @" .
"@ Yeah . @"
Problem solved .
Now , Hillary might have brained him with an ashtray , but he would n't have been in legal trouble .
Or better yet , he could have settled with Jones when she was only asking for a third of what she eventually got and an apology .
Please be logical .
The CIA says that she was covert .
You are acting as if because no one could be convicted , she becomes non @-@ covert .
Valerie Plame was a covert agent at the time she was outed .
The CIA has verified this .
I always find it hysterically funny when a leftist suddenly develops a love for the CIA .
No , really .
After years of thinking the CIA is putting microchips in their butts , they suddenly loooooove the CIA when it has a problem with Bush .
Let 's be blunt .
This was intergency office politics @...
and it was bullshit .
The CIA told Bush , "@ It 's a slam dunk , Mr. President @" on WMD 's .
Then there were n't any WMD 's and the fingerpointing started .
Please .
She becomes "@ non @-@ covert @" because no one was actually charged with that .
Because her name was publicly out there where even Nancy Drew could have figured out who she was .
It is n't covert when half the reporters and politicians in Washington knows you work at the CIA and you sent your house husband off on a junket because he looked bored around the house .
Here 's the gag about Joe Wilson .
In Febuary of 2003 , he wrote an op @-@ ed where he not only said he believed Saddam had WMD 's , but we should n't invade because he might use them .
So much for him knowing the "@ truth @" .
<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/06/opinion/oe-wilson6"> A '@ Big Cat @' With Nothing to Lose - Los Angeles Times </a>
But after it all goes south and it looks like they might start firing people at the CIA , he goes public that he "@ knew @" there were no WMD 's , and people asked , "@ Who the heck is Joe Wilson ? @"
Yeah .
From what I 've read Plame was the best "@ unkept @" secret in DC . She was no more covert than I am .
Her last assignment in Russia was a bust .
They had to send her home because the Russkies knew who she was .
She was assigned desk duty thereafter .
Can n't be covert when the enemy has you pegged .
As for WMD 's Hell .
Every intelligence agency in the world thought Saddam had em and thats what the invasion was based on .
Incorrect intel from everyone .
Well , the reason why the intel agencies thought that was because that 's what Saddam wanted them to think .
Because he thought the reason why he did n't get ousted in 1991 was becasue the alliance did n't want to fight a chemical war in Iraq .
So as long as they thought he had them , he was safe , even as he gave most of them up and was unable to produce new ones .
How covert can you be when you and your husband are plastered all over his website along with where you work and what you do ?
That was one huge scam from the word go and designed to embarrass certain people , which as far as the MSM was concerned , did .
Even when the bogus '@ leak @' was revealed as an inside CIA thing , the MSM still tried to keep the illusion alive that it was Bush , Cheney & Co. who orchestrated the whole thing .
But we have a MSM that is considerably less than honest and ethical .
Yep .
To bad they did n't do as thorough a job on Barry as they did on Bush , Cheney and company .
Imagine sending 200 reporters to Alaska to try to dig up dirt on a woman running for the VP slot on the GOP ticket .
Those same 200 could have done some digging on Barry Boy when he was running for POTUS .
Honest and ethical ??
Our MSM ai n't even in the ballpark .
The Week ?
Does he have a "@ One Free Affair @" card ?
Plame was a covert agent .
This is a fact .
Let 's do n't argue about a simple fact .
You mean except no one was charged with outing an agent and her name was in the public domain and half of Washington knew who she was @....
I guess "@ covert @" is one of those words that does n't mean what it actually means .
NEXT @---
Here 's another fact @: the Reagan administration broke the law in aiding the Contras .
Congress forbade the aid , the Reagan administration went against the direct will of Congress .
1 ) So what ?
2 ) The Boland Amendment , which was what was broken here , had no criminal penalty or enforcement procedures .
3 ) Bonus cut @- The Boland Amendment only forbade budget funds from going to the contras .
It did not forbid the profits of other ventures from going to them .
Which is why no one was actually ever charged with sending arms to the Contras .
They were charged with things like "@ lying to Congress @" when Congress knew damned well what was going on .
I 'm shocked that there 's gambling going on here !
And another @: mining the harbors in Nicaragua was an act of war .
The harbor was secretly mined , no one was told , and when Barry Goldwater found out about it , he tore Reagan administration officials a new one .
Was n't this when Barry was also claiming he believed in UFO 's ?
Who cared what that senile old jerk thought at that point .
You can thump your chest and pretend that you like the President to break the law .
But you can n't pretend that what the Bush administration did , or what the Reagan administration did , was legal .
And if my dad was the guy who had a gun held to his head by a crazed Jihadi , I would n't care that Reagan did something "@ illegal @" to save his life .
Nor would you .
This is our system of government , under the USC .
Have you heard of it ?
And the Congress was free to impeach .
Oh , but wait , they did n't do that !
Because they were n't going to go out and impeach a president for not letting the commies win .
The judge accepted Fitzgerald 's evidence that Plame was covert .
But again , no one was charged with that .
Cute , but stupid .
The CIA is the authority on their agents .
If they say she 's covert , she 's covert .
So if they shoot you and say you were an enemy spy , you 'd take that on face value , too ?
Her name being in Who 's Who is irrelevant .
Deal with the reality here .
Her name was known .
That she was a covert agent was not .
Except half of Washington knew she worked at the CIA and she was pulled out of Russia because the Russians knew who she was .
Jackie Gingrich , Newt and his first wife 's daughter , however have refuted the story of him "@ divorcing his wife when she was battling cancer @" .
Jackie said @--@ I 'm thinking in a Larry King interview but can n't remember for sure @--@ that it was her mother who requested the divorce and the tumor was benign , not cancer .
He did start dating Marriane before the divorce was final and was cheating on Marianne when he confessed that infidelity .
However those who condemn Newt 's personal life , which was pretty scuzzy , do n't seem to have a problem with President Clinton 's affair with Gennifer Flowers , various other '@ bimbo eruptions , and getting blow jobs in the Oval Office and do n't seem to think that impaired his ability to preside .
So either there is a huge double standard at play here or Newt 's infidelities do n't matter either .
How about it ?
Republicans are the preacher party .
So Republicans have to live up to that .
Republicans are the bulk of the ones who claimed that Clinton 's infidelities mattered .
I know a few Democrats spoke out against him but they were few and far between .
I personally think that if Hyde had n't rushed the matter through the House there might have been more time for some of the more serious allegations to be substantiated and for other people who had been keeping silent to speak up .
There might even have been official rape charges to contend with , not just rumors .
But Hyde did rush it .
And basically the Republicans looked mean for it , so they justly have to carry extra baggage around with them when they transgress traditional mores .
Eneeeway @...
some people do object to both Gingrich and Clinton .
But it 's not necessarily an incorrect double standard to condemn one and not the other .
Republicans are the ones who said it mattered .
If you live by the sword , you die by the sword .
Democrats can have their Clintons and their Weiners and move on from it more quickly than we can .
It 's just plain not the indictment of their party which Republican cheaters are of ours .
I am one who said the infidelities did not affect Clinton 's ability to president any more than it affected FDR or JFK that we KNOW fooled around and some others for whom there are suspicions .
And while I do not condone anybody cheating on his / her spouse , and do think it calls their character into question , I am nevertheless fully qualified to comment on the reverse hypocrisy when Democrats did n't condemn their own but hold Republicans to a higher standard .
Most especially when they have repeatedly accused us of condemning Clinton for the '@ blow jobs @' instead of the actual offenses .
The famous sixteen words were taken out of the SOTU address Bush gave because the intell to back it up was not there .
The Bush administration put them back in .
The famous 16 words were correct .
The British did have evidence the Iraqis were trying to buy uranium .
MI-6 stood by that statement .
So it was an accurate statement .
they did n't get it , but they asked for it .
Look , guy , George Tenat went into Bush 's office and said "@ It 's a slam dunk , Mr. President ! @"
Joe Wilson wrote in the LA Times that no only did Saddam have WMD 's , but we needed to give him a graceful way out because he 'd use them .
This is a lot of people playing CYA when something goes wrong .
If you had a real job , you see it happens every day in the business world , who ends up holding the bag of dog poop .
Myself .
Saddam was a scumbag and I 'm glad he 's dead .
Are n't you ?
The fact that Gingrich said it matters makes his case different from Clinton 's .
A free country must have honest leaders if it is to remain free .
We are in deep trouble as a society @...
People are looking for a guidepost as to how they should live , how their institutions should behave , and who they should follow .
That was in connection with the page scandals of 1983 .
He stitched up his own baggage .
He has to carry it .
It 's good of you to try to be fairminded , but Gingrich made his Samsonite .
Deliberately and methodically .
Now he has to carry it .
Wow , you have totally drank the kool @-@ aid .
Next , you 're gonna tell us that Saddam was behind 9 / 11 .
Not at the cost of over $ 1 Trillion and over 5,000 U.S. military deaths .
HELL NO !!!!
Well then @-@ what is your opinion on us getting involved in Libya ?
I believe I have already stated that I think anyone who 's focusing on personal shit that 's between him and his ex @-@ wife is a dumbfuck who deserves to have the nation crumble around him while he pretends the President is just another celebrity to paparazzi to death .
Of course , I think you 're a dumbfuck no matter what happens , so feel free to carry on your inane drivel indefinitely .
You probably believe that anyone who makes you look foolish is a dumbfuck , so I 'm OK with it .
My opinion is that Bush spent $ 1 T rillion to get Saddam .
Obama spent $ 1 B illion to get Gaddafi .
Looks like Obama has plenty of CEO @-@ type executive experience to me .
I put the words they probably said @...
because they are the only ones that make sense .
Grow a fuckin @' sense of humor , for crying out loud .
When you have to make heroes out of under @-@ achieving affirmative action hires , you know you are really kind of weak in the hero department .
Yes , I know .
The words that made sense to you .
The dialogue from the movie in your head .
Meanwhile , we 've got a real world going on out here .
Everyone in the real world thought she was lying through her teeth @...
Two points .
1 ) The Democrats looked at the same evidence , and came to the same conclusions .
2 ) So you are saying that it was n't worth it if it went over a certain cost .
Good thing you werne't around during WWII .
"@ Wow , getting Hitler is too expensive .
Better just let him kill those people . @"
I believe we lost that many to the days leading to D-day and at D-day .
Back then it was a united country @..
today is weaker because of the self righteous press of Vietnam , Korea and relive a past
The only thing that was indefensible was Clinton 's total sloth on the Bin Laden problem .
If he did n't need a distraction , he did n't give a shit .
This is a baseless claim , to distract from my point about Clarke .
No , it 's a dead on claim .
He bombed the Aspirin factory in 1998 ( which turned out to have nothing to do with Bin Laden ) the week he revealed he had been lying to us for eight months about Lewinsky .
Then he never , ever mentioned it again .
Then Clarke , whom NON ONE EVER HEARD OF pops out of the woodwork and says , "@ I told Condi about Bin Laden , and she looked at me funny @" , when in fact , there are numerous taped interviews where it was clear Condi knew all about Bin Laden .
So Clarke did really nothing under Clinton , and whined that he did n't get a promotion after Bush took over .
Not even a good dodge .
Answer the question @- why did n't your side hold ONE Senator accountable for voting for the war on your own side ?
It 's a good response to a really ridiculous comment .
You seem to be holding me personally accountable for how all Democrats voted .
Are you crazy ?
Desperate ?
What ?
No , it 's not .
I was pointing out the hypocrisy of your party colletively , not you personally .
Collectively , your party nominated Kerry in 2004 because he voted for the war , and in 2006 , you did n't vote out one Senator who had voted for it .
Not one .
You did try to go after poor Joe Leiberman because he ignored the "@ War Bad Now @" memo .
But even managed to survive as an independent .
Okay , make it easy for you .
Explain why I should give a shit about any of it ?
Because you understand the basic nature of the nation that you live in .
I do understand it .
We have one party that does the bidding of the rich , and another one that is trying to make as many of us dependent on the government as humanly possible .
So it 's really a case of "@ choose your serfdom @" .
What nation do you think we live in ?
Okay , Lumpy , I 'm ready now .
I 'm ready to start listening to what people have to say good for the guy .
Has anyone been saying anything good about him ?
More specific than how smart he is ?
I have n't been paying attention to the whole thread .
Lotsa noise in it .
But if you have , could you summarize the high points ?
What does Newt plan for the nation starting in 2013 ?
I 'm ready to listen !
I was kinda asking for the beefs , there 's beefs a plenty @...
I have n't read the whole thread .
I did notice a theme of whining about his marital problems which seems odd to me coming from liberals .
They seem to want to keep Republicans on a moral pedestal so that they can simultaneously tear it down .
I think Democrats have been successful in down grading religious faith and morals down to a bigots paradise .
They use religion as a weapon @..
it just not appropriate @..
Sorry I can n't summarize the high points @...
Sharks & NY Islanders starts in 15 minutes @..
See what your thread has become my friend Lumpster ?
If I had more time I 'd figure it out but I suspect hypocrisy and liberal forked tongue desperation played a large part @...
ole Buddy @...
You never heard of Clarke , but that 's because you 're not particularly well informed .
There 's a record of Clarke attempting to get the Bushies to pay attention to bin Laden .
They held a meeting , FINALLY , shortly before 9 / 11 .
Bush received a memo shortly before 9 / 11 called
That would be the same memo that called a hijacking plot NOT credible .
In fact , Bush rightfully said after that breifing that gave him no new information , "@ Well , you 've covered your ass . @"
Clark was a non @-@ entity in an administration that just saw terrorism as a way to take attention away from bimbo eruptions .
This is mind blowingly stupid .
Do you remember 9 / 11 ?
Do you grasp that Clarke and Clinton were right about bin Laden , and Bush and Condi were wrong ?
We nominated Kerry because he voted for the war ?
Well , you could have nominated Howard Dean , who was against the war from the get @-@ go .
You did n't .
Because you did n't want to appear weak .
And you thought a manufactured war hero would give you credibility .
Oh , wait .
He got those purple hearts for minor injuries and then hung around with Jane Fonda after the war @....
OOOOOOOPS .
We nominated him because we thought he had the best shot .
I live in America .
A place with freedom of speech , and that freedom of speech has helped to secure your liberty .
The only thing that secures my liberty is that there are big , burley men with guns ready to do violence on my behalf @--- to paraphrase George Orwell .
The ability of liberal morons to say stupid things is just an annoyance .
Bullshit .
Reality is over your head .
I started my own thread for high points instead of beefs .
But it was royally hijacked .
Hope it 's a good game !
Without a doubt my friend .
False .
They looked at the evidence that Bush allowed them to see .
Oh , right .
Because clearly , none of these guys who had been around Washington longer than Bush had knew anyone over at the CIA or Pentagon .
Because they had n't been looking at the same intelligence in the 1990 's that said the same things .
So , because Bush withheld key intelligence that undermined his case for going to war with Iraq , Democrats should have just hit up '@ Deep Throat @" @-@ like sources in underground parking lots to learn the truth ?
We were n't allies with those countries .
Americans did n't want a second war .
They thought the first one was a pretty dumb idea .
Had the Japanese not bombed Pearl Harbor , we 'd have let Hilter win and not really cared .
We were n't allies with Britain and France ????
I 'm beginning to realize that I 've given you much too much credit .
A dictator who was n't a threat to us , had n't caused us any problems , and who was actually co @-@ operating with us at that point .
And all he had to do was let power go to some crazy Islamists who are already sizing everyone up for Burhkas @...
A dictator who killed hundreds of Americans by blowing up a plane over Scotland .
As opposed to a dictator in Iraq who never launched any terrorist attacks against the U.S.
So ?
Does that make those 5,000 deaths inconsequential ?
Well , no .
I 'm interested in facts , I 've posted facts and the links to back them up .
You attempt to rebut them by imagining conversations and motives that suit your bias .
In almost every post , you put words into people 's mouths , and have them act out scenes based on your suspicions and dislikes .
That is not anything resembling a debate .
That 's you in a fight with reality .
Quoting Cecille @:
First , calm down , and read what I 'm actually saying .
Newt spoke in speeches about his wife 's cancer .
Both she and Newt say that she had cancer .
This is not something you need to debate , because it 's been established that she had cancer .
She had surgery for uterine cancer , and then later went in to have a tumor removed .
The tumor removed in the second surgery was benign .
That does n't make her not have cancer earlier .
She still had uterine cancer .
I 'm not sure where the "@ verge of death @" comment comes from , but it is n't from me .
Perhaps your let your imagination , or your anger , get the best of you .
Newt 's wife said the divorce came as a surprise .
Newt said that it did n't .
We have both of them on the record making these statements .
They do not agree .
There 's no point in you and I trying to figure out which of them is right , because they are the two people in the discussion , and they are not in agreement .
Newt has admitted that he cheated on both of his wives .
This is not up for debate .
He admits it .
Newt 's second wife says that he dumped her a few months after she was diagnosed with MS .
PBS is a reputable source .
The other sources are reputable as well .
You can n't spend your life ignoring inconvenient facts and expect to get anywhere .
Take the car key out of your ear and listen to what I 'M saying .
YOU say that he says these things .
And then you cite ONLY quotes from him admitting to the one thing I 've never argued .
Furthermore , your sources for quotes are suspect , if not laughable .
So this basically amounts to YOUR WORD FOR IT , which I absolutely DO need to argue .
No , you do NOT get to state that something is so and tell me to just accept it and expect that to happen .
I pay every bit as much attention to your half @-@ assed declarations of reality as I do to your piece @-@ of @-@ shit sources .
PBS is a reputable source IN YOUR OPINION .
That means nothing .
Your other sources are as reputable as a conversation overheard in a high school girls @' bathroom .
You can n't spend your life declaring things to be facts with no substantiation and expect to get anything but laughed at .
That 's where we are now .
When you are ready to SHOW rather than TELL , come find me .
Until then , you no longer deserve even the marginal respect of having me read your posts , let alone respond .
Begone .
Who do you consider a reputable source ?
Give me five examples .
This should be entertaining .
Where did that crazy bitch run off to ?
I can n't understand how anyone could be so lacking in common sense as to believe that Newt Gingrich could ever be elected president .
I sense fear from your lash out rant .
Obama , "@ the manchild @" , would lose big in a one on one debate with ol @' Newtie .
No contest .
He can n't hide his gaffes , his hypocrisy on issues , his scandals on fast and furious , cronie capitalism on solyndra / sunpower / and his failed Keynesian approach to our economy .
That alinsky / cloward @-@ piven crap is running out of time .
I think michele should make a trip to target and stock on crybaby blankets and kleenix .
Is Newtie still in favor of Cap & Trade ?
I 'd be in favor of capping you , and trading you in for someone with a brain .
I would say everyone was wrong about Bin Laden .
But Clinton had eight years to do something substanive about the guy , from when the first WTC attack happened , to the bombing of USS Cole .
And he did nothing .
He let the guy walk out of the Sudan ( after the Sudan had offered to turn him over ) and into Afghanistan .
Bush on the other hand , wiped out most of his network , toppled the two regimes that Clinton said was aiding him ( Iraq and Afghanistan ) froze his assets , captured or killed most of his key subordinates .
To the point that all he had left at the end was a house and his porn stash where he lived cowering in fear .
No .
Everyone was n't wrong about bin Laden .
Clarke was right .
Bill Clinton was right .
George Bush was wrong before 9 / 11 .
The people you 're citing who attacked Clarke were wrong .
They complained that Clarke kept coming in with his hair on fire @---@ which means that he grasped the reality of the problem BEFORE 9 / 11 .
But in order to defend Bush , the right has been forced to attack Clarke for being overzealous @...
instead of having some degree of honesty and admitting that when Clarke 's hair was on fire , Clarke was right .
Clinton was obsessed with bin Laden to the point that he was criticized for it .
<a href="http://www.snopes.com/rumors/clinton.asp"> snopes.com @: Clinton Administration and Terrorists </a>
As for Clinton passing on bin Laden , are you determined to bring up every right wing myth in existence in this thread ?
<a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2008/01/clinton-passed-on-killing-bin-laden/"> FactCheck.org : Clinton Passed on Killing bin Laden ? </a>
Really ?
Does n't that say something about you guys , then ?
You do n't stand by your principles , you comprimise them because you want to win .
Which is , of course , why you lost .
Yes , it says that we are not rigid ideologues .
As for '@ why we lost @' , that 's pretty funny .
Look at the crop of candidates that the Pubs have this go round @....
please , do n't compromise your principles .
Nominate Newt , and let him go down in flames .
Clarkes story changed depending upon the audience .
That was clearly proven .
Alright back to your rant .
Actually , the only person who supported the "@ Clarke was a prophet @" BS is clarke .
A guy who we already caught lying when he said Condi Rice did n't know what Al Qaeda was when she talked about it during several interviews in 1999 and 2000 .
Therefore , nothing he said was believable .
You have a problem with attacking the person with hyperbole rather than with facts .
Thus , you feel you can dismiss Clarke by personally attacking him , dismiss Hill by claiming her students were bored , for example .
That 's an illogical way to approach what we 're talking about .
Clarke 's story is backed up by the record .
He asked for meetings on al Qaeda , repeatedly .
We know that no meeting occurred , in spite of his asking for months , until shortly before 9 / 11 .
We know that the people who dismissed Clarke as having his "@ hair on fire @" were wrong .
We know that Clarke was right .
Condi was wrong .
Give the man credit .
Clinton did nothing about Bin Laden .
Come to think of it , that was pretty much his whole presidency , he just talked and talked and talked .
And took credit for the work of others .
Kind of like the Affirmative Action President .
You 're denying the reality of the record with more personal attacks on the person we 're discussing .
Why , Newt does n't represent where most of the party is right now .
If we nominated a guy who was closest to where the rank and file is on the issues , we 'd nominate Perry or Cain .
Not that it matters , though .
The Affirmative Action President is going down .
So you 're saying that you 're not going to nominate Perry or Cain ?
As a prediction , I mean .
Who 's going to be the nominee ?
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bQQldsKJDU"> Bush @: "@ I 'm not that concerned with bin Laden @" - YouTube </a>
LOL Obama said pretty much the same thing hack .
Not to mention both presidents still pursued .
The biggest difference is Obama sat on it for months afraid to pull the trigger .
No , he absolutely did n't .
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKHsjRzUTLQ"> Obama in 2008 @: '@ We Will Kill Bin Laden , We Will Crush Al Qaeda @' - YouTube </a>
Proof is in the puddin @' .
Obama waited until the mission had the best chance of success .
He was right .
Booyah !
That 's not completely true either .
What he did was the build up a relationship with elements in the Pakistan ISI and military while rebuilding units that were completely devoted to taking out Bin Laden .
This was a tricky and complicated set of operations that took a good amount of time to get to a point where it would have some level of achieving success .
I am really quite surprised he gave the Bush administration any credit at all .
But he did .
Then is n't that waiting until there was the best chance of success ?
So , is Newtie still in favor of Cap & Trade ?
Liar .
"@ Waiting @" implies that there was an infrastructure already set up for the operation .
As in , all the dots were connected and Obama just simply had to wait on the "@ right time @" .
That was not the case .
Again , you 're a liar .
Back up your bullshit .
I suspect they are awaiting instructions on how to counter facts with an alternative .
Facts ?
"@ more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history . @"
- Newt Gingrich
More were added to food stamps under Bush than under Obama , <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-01-18/fact-check-gingrich-obama-food-stamps/52645882/1"> reports </a> Brooks Jackson @: "@ Newt Gingrich claims that '@ more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history .
' He 's wrong .
More were added under Bush than under Obama , according to the most recent figures @...
Gingrich would have been correct to say the number now on food aid is historically high .
The number stood at 46,224,722 persons as of October , the most recent month on record .
And it 's also true that the number has risen sharply since Obama took office .
But Gingrich goes too far to say Obama has put more on the rolls than other presidents .
We asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Food and Nutrition service for month @-@ by @-@ month figures going back to January 2001 .
And they show that under President George W. Bush the number of recipients rose by nearly 14.7 million .
Nothing before comes close to that . @"
Of course , you would n't know a fact if it pushed your customer out of the way and bit you on the ass .
Did you even read this ? @...
what a spin @..
it 's Bush 's fault for the recipients added during his admin , but somehow not so for Obama because he inherited a mess ?
Not to mention in a mere 3 years , Obama has added only a few hundred thousand less than under Bush 's 8 ?
Priceless .
By what criteria does anyone justify blaming a President for how many people were added to the food stamp rolls ?
Specifically .
Reporting facts that Republicans may not like is liberal .
Doing things that Republicans may not like is Presidential .
How dare the news report facts and @...
stuff !
Liberals !
Diversion @...
and not accurately addressing the real issue we have .
Here is the issue @..
Obama was reported this way @...
Obama , showing America how he , too , is human , referred to the 57 satates today offering his overworked campaign staff reason to enjoy a much needed laugh .
Perry was reported this way @...
Perry , again showed reason to question his knowledge of the three branches of government when he seemed to believe there are only 8 supreme court justices .
His campaign staff is running around trying to put out the fires this has created for Perry 's campaign .
Enough said .
So you want the news to do an in depth fact finding mission to determine if Obama has been to 57 states and that would be fair since Newt said he never lobbied ?
Immature diversion from the point I was making .
Guess you just did n't have anything better to respond with .
Is the media in the bag for Newt ?
Murdoch is .
Just saying Diversion does n't work anymore .
You mean how to counter Newt hurt Feelings right ?
Everytime hes asked something he clutches his pearls and says "@ well , I never @"
um @...
newt played this up because SC is a very right leaning state who already thinks the media is far left .
Newt basically jerked over all their faces and the people wanted more of it .
You can see it in this thread as well .
In the end the story is this .
Newt played it up to the base , they loved it , but he still dodged the question .
You can n't take one debate in a primary and use it for the rest of the race .
If he were to win it would be a different ballgame , so his answer would have to be different .
Or
He could answer it the same and risk loosing the middle more moderate Indies and GOP @...
Another one who decided to deabte something he knows nothing about .
Obviously , you did n't watch the debate .
It 's a bit more than that .
He gets a standing ovation evey time he bitch slaps them !
He gets a standing O from an extreme wingnut crowd .
Why should n't they let it be general admission , where Democrats and Independents could sit in the audience ?
curious @...
Do you see the audiences at a democratic debate as an audience of extreme wingnuts ?
Those would be '@ moonbats @' .
And no , I do n't see an exclusively Liberal audience at Democratic debates .
Definitely Lefties , though !
The media is biased in favor of a prolonged battle for the nomination because it 's better for ratings .
They will inevitably slant towards propping up the underdog and leaning on the favorite week by week day by day .
i watched the clip of it , he did n't answer it .
he whined about the media and how disgusting it was for them to ask such a question .
nice try @.....
Like i said its rather meaningless anyways .
Newt is a hypocrite when it comes to marriage so his opinions on it are meaningless .
Hey folks @...
HERE IT IS @....
PLASMABALL THINKS IT IS OK TO DEBATE SOMETHING BASED ON A SNIPPET @...
A CLIP OF WHAT HIS MEDIA DEEMED WAS WORTHY OF HIS KNOWING .
I mean @...
you actually said he never answered the question .
That is completely false @.....
he answered it completely .
We do it all the time here @...
I watched the whole clip of him not really answering it , and giving King shit for it .
If there was more , feel free to provide said evidence and we can go from thier .
He did n't answer the question , he just blasted King and the media ( which was his answer ) .
Im not sure where you are going with this and how you are reading my " he did n't answer the question @" .
He answered it with a dodge .
When ?
Where ?
You want to be the next one bitch @-@ slapped by Newt - ?
When he made his food stamp comment .
Are you retarded ?
Facts are sometimes difficult to accept are n't they ?
Yeah , when they are not factual .
If the media is in the bag for Newt , then it is possible that CNN set up the question so Newt can answer in a forcible way .
Forcible enough to send undecided republicans into his corner for the South Carolina primary .
I have called Newt a sabotuer for the Dem 's , and the '@ handling @' of the debate by Newt appeared staged to me .
If the liberal media was against Newt , they would have taken into account how Newt performed against the moderator in past debates .
The moderators normally would not ask the question right off the bat ( which King has done ) but knife Newt through his opponents like in previous debates so that Newt could not answer directly .
All Newt did was verbally body @-@ slam a liberal .
That is how a Newt won S.C. In that case , Hannity should run for President !
What makes you think John King is a Liberal ?
Or were you not thinking ?
Oh my fault .
It is better to say that Newt verbally body @-@ slammed CNN , a media outlet held to be liberally biased by many republicans .
Now is there a problem ?
My was not a diversion .
Mine was a response to something someone had said that was inaccurate .
No one is saying the media does not report the facts equally @.....
they do .
But it is HOW they report them that makies it appear there is media bias .
With the GOP candidates @...
we hear the media say "@ Rommeys critics feel he has something to hide in regard to his tax returns @"
With Obama @....
we heard @...
"@ It is not unusual for a candiate to not want to release his college transcripts @...
some do , some do n't . @"
Why did n't they say "@ Obamas critrics feel he may have something to hide regarding his college transcripts @...
afterall @...
it is true @..
his critics felt that
Oh SHIT !
Well , shit , why did n't you present that evidence earlier .
"@ Why did n't they say @...@ @"
is n't proof of anything other than you thought up a question they did n't answer .
Why did n't they ask Bush what happened to the millions that was lost in Iraq ?
Bias or they did n't ask ?
Because I can think of questions they asked Obama and not Bush but what the fuck does that mean ?
Nothing .
hey @..
They intervvciewed Newts X right before a primary .
Did they interview any of Obamas former class mates ?
Did they interview any of Obamas parishoners at Wrights church ?
Did they interview anyne part of the Resko company ?
Heck @...
I got a question @....
who did they interview to dig up any dirt that may be out there about Obama ?
Who from his past did they intertview ?
Yo @...
he reacted to the question @....
and then he answered the question .
Yet the media that deemed it appropriate for the question to be asked did not feel the public warranted knowing his answer .
I will not provide you a clip .
I do n't need to .
You want to assume you are correct @....
go for it @....
live in your ignorance .
I love it .
The media is on Romney 's side @....
Newt stings them back .
Actually , the media is on Obama 's side .
yes that is right -- which also compels them to favor Newt over romney .
most Democrats in DC feel he will be one of the easiest opponents for obama to defeat in the general election .
right or wrong they think of romney as more electable
Who would think that ?
The guy wreakes of Conservatism @...
Ah cute spin @.....
And lovely punt @.....
You claimed he answered it , so it falls on you to provide proof .
You will n't , i win .
Hey ,
They asked Obama about Bill Aires but never asked Bush about his relationship with the Bin Ladens @...
You know what that means @...
Yep , Media Bias .
We can do this all day but at the end of it all , it 's just you laying out bullshit to claim you are the victim of the liberal media , liberal education , liberal historians , liberal scientists , liberal brainwashers , liberal washing machines that will n't get that stain out etc.
It must be tough always being under attack @...
Thats when you let your conservadaddy hold you tight and tell you what a big bad world is out there and he 'll protect you
ahh @...
Perhaps @....
from debate standpoint @...
sure @...
I will n't produce the evinidence @...
so you win .
Congratulations .
You won a debate with an anonymous poster on the internet .
Yet you are please as punch that you have no idea that he answered the question .
An example of someone who prefers to be labelled a winner over knowing the truth .
I 'm waiting for them to interview obama 's drug dealer .
you did not answer my question @....
They interviewed Newts ex wife right before a primary .
They interviewed people that worked for companies once owned by Bain .
Who from Obamas past did they interview ?
Exactlyu @...
he admittted to using drugs .
Do we know he did not have a bigger iussue ?
Who did they interview to find out ?
He admitted to having some marxists semtiments while in college @...
who did they interview to discuss his "@ enthusiasm @" or "@ lack of it @" from back then ?
But they interviewed an x wife who had already told her story to the press several years earlier @...
and then made that the first question of a debate .
Reverend Wright @...
any other assumptions ?
I 'm STILL waiting for them to interview GWB 's drug dealer and AA sponsors .
Exactly GWB admitted to being a coke user @...
I 'm sure youre all broken up about them not interviewing GWB drug dealer .
Or does you curiosity lose steam when you see the ( R ) ?
WOOOO I Rule , i won a debate on the internets @....@ !!!!!
Well my day is complete !
Have a good day
Hey ,
See how that works ?
Exactly @...
Reverend Wright .
Obama claimed to know nothing about his sentiments .
Then he claimed he did but paid no mind .
So one answer was a lie @...
so we know he , like all politicians , will lie for political expediency @.....
So exactly who did they interview to find out the truth ?
You seem content with the truth @....
you know @....
"@ I did n't know of them @....
oh yeah @...
he was my mentor @...
so yes @...
I knew of them @....
but I never really paid attention @...@ @"
And you were just fine with that .
And to you ?
The media did a great job .
FYI @...
a simple google search will give you dozens of links to his COMPLETE answer .
But , of course , you prefer only knowing what your media wants you to know @....
so you will n't conduct that search .
Live in ignorance @.....
enjoy .
First you complain they did n't interview anyone from his past .
Since you are wrong Now you are going back to the "@ they did n't ask the question I wanted them too sooo that means @...@ @"
Moving those goalposts pretty fast there skippy
But in order to be a victim you have to see attacks from everywhere .
READ @...
do n't scan @..
Never said they did interview .
Continually claimed they did n't @...
So tell me @.....
show me who they interviewed @.....
anyone ?
No way the "@ media @" is bag for ANY republican .
Whatever they do in the primaries for or against a republican is what they think will be best for the democrats .
are you saying no one interviewed Rev Wright ?
However you spin it , Newt lied .
When ?
I 've found a new avie for you .
<a href="http://www.usmessageboard.com/attachments/politics/17189d1327346960-is-the-media-in-the-bag-for-newt-head_up.jpg"> head_up.jpg </a>
ahh @...
what is google ?
Of COURSE the media is in the bag for Gingrich .
They would LOVE to see him represent the GOP .
Easy target , lots of baggage , a verbal gaffe just waiting to happen .
The only thing better than Gingrich would be Gingrich / Palin .
Holy crap , they 'd think they had died and gone to heaven .
He answered the question , numbnuts .
The answer was her allegation was false .
He offered evidence and the networks ignored it .
Or did you miss that part ?
It was a "@ when did you stop beating your wife @" question .
He handled it very well .
You are aware that the Obama team are afraid of Newt getting the nomination are n't you .
In debates , Newt will kick Obama 's pseudo @-@ intellectual butt up one side of the stage and down the other .
After all , all Obama has to run on is his dismal record and that alone has him pissing his pants .
Still reheating that old food ?
I thought Obama was afraid of Trump , Pailin , Perry and Cain ?
What happened ?
Perry
Perry was n't at the debate .
Or did you miss that too ?
Yes , they are , but they are wanting a Romney , Obama ticket , for the very reason that many conservatives despise Romney
I pay the media no mind when I am voting anyways .
Sarah Palin is held to be a moron by many Democrats .
Does that make it true ?
Rightwingers are Professional Victims ™ .
Leftwing nuts are perpetual liars
Uh @...
I do n't think so .
perry
Right , because those corporate owned media outlets ALWAYS favor the party that does n't favor them .
When ?

We already know that you are retarded .
Until Romney gets the Nomination @...
Then the "@ Free Press @" will make you Question Mormonism .
peace @...
You need the press in order to question Mormonism ?
Hey ,
Victim cries Victim
Nope , never heard it and never said it .
Newt will kick ass in a debate with Obama .
But at least I 'm smart enough not to stick my head up my ass like you .
What 's your excuse ?
What I want to see is a presidential debate where obama brings up Gingrich 's past affairs and Gingrich says "@ In both of your books you describe your cocaine addiction .
How about you give us the name of your dealer and how much you bought . @"
ROFLMAO @...
The media is in bed with Obama and any other Democrat .
You 're just being silly .
Yeah , just ask President Gore !
I do n't think Murdoch is .
He wants to win .
why does n't the op post the link where he got this hair brained idea from @..@ ?
I read this from a article somewhere in the last couple days .
can n't remember where or I 'd post it .
I think his goofy rhetoric just gets eyeballs pointing at some screen be it a TV , tablet , smartphone , etc. @..
Better to quote him / opine on him and get the attention as a result than not .
At it 's heart , I think the members of the media from all outlets are just as worried about how a Gingrich presidency would hold @....
kids scrubbing toilets , orphanages , etc. @..
Its about as far away from the ideal of America as one can get .
But when Obama suggested the same exact thing , it was labelled by the media and the left as a "@ wonderful @" idea .
Or did you forget abouyt Obama saying that all our younger generation should get involved at the community level @....
helping senior citizens , working in community centers , etc. @..
Did you think he wanted them to do things like tax reporting and community planning @...
you know @...
things that require advanced educattions ??
You can provide a quote he wanted kids to do janitorial duties ?
I can for Newt .
Your move .
Not every thread is borne from some online story , bimbo .
Some of us actually can think for ourselves .
I hope you are n't including yourself in that "@ we @" , carpet puppet .
Well , I 'm definitely not including you .
From the onset .
It was clear he was n't serious about being president .
Serious meaning that he did n't take the time to prepare for the race .
He was a little busy recovering from back surgery , geaux , and he went into the race too soon after surgery .
He simply was n't himself .
Coaches make their athletes take off a year sometimes , depending on the surgery and the amount of time they can take a 16 @-@ year @-@ old high school player to a 35 @-@ year @-@ old professional ballhandler back on the field .
Campaigns are rigorous , and Perry is I think at least 50 .
I 'm sure he had the best of care , but I think I 've heard some surgery anesthetics become residual and might slow people down mentally and physically .
He had to have the surgery , and it was at the worst time .
He 's usually not one to get mixed up mid @-@ sentence and has always been a good speaker .
Even so , it will be good to have our governor Rick Perry back .
The Perrys are real nice people .
Oh , so he was hopped up on Percocet ?
So he was , in fact , impaired while running for president ?
That 's a convincing argument @.....
I 've yet to hear about this "@ residual / permanent @" effects of anesthesia .
I suffered through about one million pre @-@ op consents and have yet to hear that listed as a possible adverse event .
Though , I 'd be happy to look at any material you have .
Are we going to blame anesthesia for Perry knowing jack and shit about foreign policy too ?
You guys can have him back .
I will n't even mention that The Rabbi & Missourian were his early cheerleaders before Perry even opened his mouth .
When Perry 's name first came up as a possible candidate my thoughts were "@ ANOTHER Texan after "@ W @" ?
You got to be kiddin me lol
Today , Rick Perry dropped out , and I had to dig down five pages on USMB to find a thread on it .
Not even a gloating thread by CandyCorn .
I 'm so disappointed .
Ahh , so sad , really .
I had high hopes that Perry would be the guy who could bridge the divide between the TEA Party and the GOP establishment .
But it never came to pass .
First , the Establishment has it 's heart set on Romney .
If they have to lie , cheat , steal or do whatever , that 's what they 'll do .
And they 'll blame us when Romney loses .
But Perry made mistakes .
Much like Fred Thompson four years ago , you simply can n't do these things on the fly . You have to build an organization , you have to get used to stumping , you have to get supporters lined up .
You have to participate in the early debates with the fringe characters to find your voice and your little corner to base yourself in .
I think that there will be people who will declare the TEA Party dead .
I do n't think so .
The thing is , the TEA Movement has n't really been around long enough to establish solid leaders .
It took 16 years between Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan for the modern conservative movement to take hold .
After Romney loses , Perry might well be able to take another shot at it .
But he should take his time and spend more time introducing himself to the American public .
1 · 2 · Uhmmm .
Ron Paul , some help please .
He stumbled badly in the first debate and never recovered .
It takes a lot more than slogans and platitudes to win over conservative s . They are smart and they research issues , they want substantive answers .
Perry could n't answer the questions in depth and it showed .
If Perry was a Democrat , he 'd be their candidate - liberals will buy anything @....
Hope and Change anyone ?
I believe several things hurt Rick Perry .
He did have surgery , and the effects of anaesthesia can last a long time .
Perry entered the race too late , he also just for whatever reason was not himself .
Unfortunately for Rick Perry , by the time he started doing really good in the debates , it was too late .
If Rick Perry had started the debates they way he did his last two debates , he would most likely have the nomination locked up .
It is sad that Perry started off as bad as he did , he was the only candidate that stood up for and defended the Marines who pissed on the bodies of the Taliban .
I am going to support the United States Marine corps and disagree with Mr. Perry and you .
It takes a lot more than slogans and platitudes to win over conservatives .
They are smart and they research issues , they want substantive answers .
Okay then @...
as a conservative you should be able to tell us what Mitt 's plans for the military are then , right ?
I do n't mean where he 's going to send them .
I mean , is he going to increase the size , decrease the size , close bases in Europe , Korea , Iraq , etc. @...@ ?
Surely as a "@ smart @" conservative , you 've "@ researched @" the issue and he 's provided substantive answers .
Total agreement about Perry .
He has never run in a race where the result was n't a foregone conclusion .
It showed on the National Stage and such non @-@ vetting of candidates by Texas has shown in their state 's dismal performance compared to other states .
Read his book sweetheart , it 's all there - with pictures too !!
Unfortunately he does n't have anything as catchy as "@ hope and change @" to hold your interest @.....
So essentially , for completely SUPERFICIAL reasons , we are rejecting the most qualified candidate and nominating a Ken Doll , hoping to God no one notices his religion is batshit crazy and he 's flip @-@ flopped on every issue out there .
Yup .
Makes sense to me .
Those are n't superficial reasons .
Gingrich is not a leader , at least not of the most important country on earth .
The people whom he led in the past do n't want him now , and his temperament is not suited to the Presidency .
Sorry .
Given those people were a large part of the problem , and could n't wait to get back to making deals with the other side , not seeing their objections as being the problem .
I look at the results @- Balanced budgets ( kind of ) , welfare reform and serious changes in the way Congress did business .
But , heck , no , we do n't want any real reform .
We want a guy who is going to cut more deals with the special interests , because that 's worked so well for the country .
Sure , I like Gingrich .
He 's a very smart man .
He did some good things in office so we have to give credit where credit is due .
I even considered supporting him .
But I will n't be .
Caroljo @......
has anyone ever told you that they admire your depth of thought ?

“@ As [ House ] speaker , I came back , working with President Bill Clinton .
We passed a very Reagan @-@ like program @: less regulation , lower taxes .
Unemployment dropped to 4.2 percent .

I 'm not a huge fan , but I have to give credit where credit is due and he 's wiping the floor with the republican field in these debates .
I wish Paul was a little bit more articulate and less frenetic in his responses .
He definitely offers the most substance in his replies , but a lot gets lost in translation .
Romney is a milquetoast douchewagon who can n't even give a straight answer to a simple question like '@ do the states have the right to ban contraception ?
Get used to the idea of 4 more years of the Oh @-@ Boy .
that was a stupid question and did n't deserve and answer @..
and that 's the truth .
ruth .
I do n't think that anyone has "@ killed it @" in the debates .
I think Newt has been the most accurate and forthright .
He has been married 3 times , currently for 13 years to Calista , and I respect the fact that , in spite of political consequences , he has been divorced 2 times , rather than having a sting of lovers , while married to one woman , as so many other politicians try to get away with .
I like Newt because I trust Newt .
He is the least PC of them all , thus far , and in my opinion .
Source @: Justin Quinn .
"@ A Profile of Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich . @"
USConservatives.about.com .
Newt has been neither forthright or accurate .
I think it was Paul Krugman who said that , and I like it .
Gingrich is also a pathological liar .
And he took an active part in destroying the economy by helping the GSEs defend themselves when some members of Congress were trying to unwind them .
He 's a gigantic hypocrite as well .
While he was excoriating Bill Clinton for cheating on Hillary , and made it a special point to say he was going to bring up Monica Lewinsky every chance he got , he himself was cheating on his own wife .
He was the first Speaker of the House in history to be fined .
He was caught lying to Congress .
Again , while he was trying to impeach Clinton for lying .
He left his job in disgrace .
And now @... <a href="http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-09/romney-s-bain-capital-leadership-attacked-as-exploiting-companies-for-cash"> he 's going the full Marxist </a> route of attacking creative destruction .
“@ Those of us who believe in free markets and those of us who believe that , in fact , the whole goals of investment is entrepreneurship and job creation , would find it pretty hard to justify rich people figuring out clever , legal ways to loot out a company , @” former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich told reporters in Manchester , New Hampshire , yesterday , ahead of the state ’s Jan. 10 presidential primary .
“@ Mitt Romney is not a capitalist , @” Tyler said .
“@ He is a predatory corporate mugger .
If you ever wonder why so many manufacturing jobs are overseas , you need to look no further than Mitt Romney .
He can claim thousands of jobs created , only those jobs were created in Mexico and Southeast Asia . @”
Neocons have been mistaking the elephant 's shit for the elephant .
It is time to sweep Newt into the dustbin .
You 're getting your position on other people 's intelligence from Paul Krugman .
'@ Nuff said .
He 's only a Nobel Prize winner .
Why do wingnuts hate intelligence ?
..... <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/romney-owes-his-boost-to-gingrich/2012/01/16/gIQAlrRC3P_story.html?hpid=z6"> can be the Republican @-@ candidate </a> !!!!
Please show the intelligence prerequisite for the Nobel Peace Prize
Did Manifold say Obama was wiping the field with the Republicans in the debates ?
Um @...
does he know that Obama is n't debating the Republicans ?
Krugman got the Nobel prize for economics , not peace .
However , he 's still an idiot .
I 've seen some debates where Krugman 's opponent had him practically in tears .
Sit him down with Walter Williams .
It would be priceless .
I think such an encounter actually occurred .
However , I 'm not certain of it .
The readers of this column know that I never make charges of racism .
Maybe Krugman and the Wall Street occupiers have the answer .
<a href="http://cnsnews.com/node/464826"> LINK </a>
Another dope who does n't believe in facts .
I do n't think he said that .
More likely , he said that the winner of these GOP debates is Obama .
Because he is .
No you have n't .
Krugman is a loon
<a href="http://cnsnews.com/node/464826"> LINK </a>
Wow , this guy is a moron .
No wonder you wingnuts like him .
It 's all deflection and misdirection .
This is an economist who does n't know about monopolies , cartels and collusion ?
Nobody has included LeBron as among '@ the few @' .
Everything you know about monopolies , cartels and collusion .
Cartels always fall apart .
Cable monopolies are all government enforced .
All you did is demonstrate your complete ignorance .
No wonder you 're a Krugman fan .
You left out oil companies , Braniac .
There are a few who control the entire market .
Are you saying that if a government does n't break up a monopoly ( cable ) , it is enforcing the monopoly ?
I nominate Gingrich at captain of the USA Debate Team for the 2013 International Debate Olympics .
Always knew Newt could tear it up in a debate .
I mentioned OPEC , dipstick .
I 'll repeat , despite having no legal hindrances , OPEC has been unable to enforce any of its production quotas or price limits .
Government created the cable monopoly .
Virtually every city in the country grants a monopoly to one cable company or another .
Every true monopoly that has ever existed has been government enforced .
OPEC are n't oil companies , Braniac .
I 'm talking Exxon , Shell , BP @...
You think the companies you listed have a monopoly , seriously ?
Since you can mention more than one , they obviously do n't have a monopoly .
Furthermore , oil is traded on the world market , so it 's nonsensical to talk about American companies having "@ control @" of the market .
Furthermore , there are at least 20 American oil companies .
That hardly paints a picture of a limited number of competitors .
Any way you look at it , you 're wrong .
Or Thomas Sowell .
God , I would pay money to see that .
Dr. Paul won the S.C. debate @:
He won that debate @:
Ron Paul ’s crotchety meter was turned to 11 , with the scrappy Texan refusing to give an inch no matter how hard the moderators tried to shame him or put words in his mouth .
“@ Clearly you do n’t understand my position , @” he pushed back when pestered about his position on military spending .
Take that , you hand @-@ wringing , comity @-@ obsessed wusses !
That would be like putting Krugman 's brain in a Cuisinart .
That 's exactly why I 'd be willing to pay BIG money to see it .
Once the GOP primaries are over , the election begins in earnest .
What will Republicans run on ?
America knows who wrecked the economy .
That Republicans hid the cost of the wars from the country .
That the bulk of the deficit comes from the Bush tax cuts , the "@ drugs for votes @" bill and the unnecessary war .
Bush and the Republicans held both houses and the presidency for six straight years .
They have nothing to be proud of during that entire time .
In fact , they even let Bin Laden go .
You can n't run on , "@ We have to get Obama out of office because he ( and then name Republican failure ) @" .
This is n't the "@ Reagan Legacy Project @" .
People remember who did what .
There is a strategy called , "@ Just that one fact alone @" .
Obama took us out of Iraq , just that one fact alone @.....
Obama saved the auto industry , just that one fact alone @.....
Obama got Bin Laden , just that one fact alone @.....
Obama made it possible for people to insure their collage age children , just that one fact alone @....
Obama helped extend unemployment for suffering Americans , just that one fact alone @....
Republicans can n't use that strategy .
It would backfire .
There were no WMD 's .
Just that one fact alone @....
Republicans helped the Chamber of Commerce to move millions of jobs to China .
A Republican apologized to BP . Just that one fact alone @....
Republicans did nothing for those Katrina survivors .
Just that one fact alone @.....
Republicans say disaster victims low priority .
See how this is a strategy that will work for Obama but not for Republicans .
So please , someone explain to me what they will run on .
Once you hit the general election , the truth will come out .
Wow .
Just wow .
Here it is years later and according to Democrats , it is still Bush 's fault .
Here it is years after voters turned over control of two branches of government to Democrat control and Democrats are still insisting that they still are n't responsible for a FUCKING THING !
Sorry -@ but you whackos are just that .
Really , really whacko .
Get a clue -@ it is hard to insist the fault even YEARS later lies with the out of power party honey .
Maybe that bullshit still sells in nutjob land but not among normal people .
I 'm not even going to address the stupid idiotic crap you wrote -@ there is no point .
I 'm still trying to grasp the mentality that will not only say but BELIEVE it when they say even when Democrats have super majorities and total control of two branches of government meaning they have no brakes at all , had no reason to compromise with Republicans over anything and did n't and even years later -@ they still are n't responsible for a FUCKING THING .
NOT EVER .
Oh sure .
And apparently this really works for some which speaks volumes about who are their natural constituents and base .
Sorry -@ I 'm truly just not stupid enough to be a Democrat .
I can n't read stupid shit like this because there is no intelligence behind it .
You are absolutely correct .
There is no point .
It 's not like it can be denied .
Democrats do n't seem to have a problem assigning all their fiascoes to Bush or the House of Reps.
Obamacare .
Just that one fact alone will be used against Obama .
Also , Obama said he should be held accountable if he did not get the economy going .
Well , unemployment is still in the crapper , and if it still is in November , that one fact alone will sink him .
Yea , because health care for Americans is so bad .
Ron Paul ’s Campaign Manager Died of Pneumonia , Penniless and Uninsured
And so , what started in February 2007 with one laptop in Snyder 's Arlington , Va. , apartment , quickly grew into a $ 35 million campaign employing 250 people .
In the fourth quarter of that year , Snyder raised a stunning $ 19.5 million for Paul — more than any other Republican candidate had raised at the time .
*@ The Kansas City Star quoted his sister at the time as saying that a "@ a pre @-@ existing condition made the premiums too expensive . @"
Despite Paul ’s insistence that charity is the appropriate response to America ’s uninsured crisis , Snyder ’s friends raised $ 34,870.53 , far short of the $ 400,000 necessary to pay his bills .

So that 's the Republican Plan ?
The tax payer should foot the bill .
Wow , how "@ FREE ! @"
I want to see Republicans run on this .
What fiascoes are you talking about ?
Make sure you can prove it .
Do n't just lie .
Says the OP that piled shit high enough to defy gravity
Obama has even assigned his failures to "@ bad luck @" .
I am so shocked that republicans can treat one of there own in such a way as they have regarding mitt .
i am a registered democrat .
i intend to vote for mitt .
I like obama but am not sure he can get things done .
I am also a member of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints .
i know that this is an issue for alot of americans but can not understand why ?
why should it matter ?
this is why we live in a free country .
mitt is the only candidate who can win .
stop all the negative ads ( Newt ) you are just giving amunition to obama .
I am sure he is just relaxing and lauphing while all of you are fighting .
get over it and think about what is at stake .
grow up .
and get behind him .
nixon was a quaker , kennady was a catholic .
remember separation of church and state !!!!!
mitt will not try to convert all of you .
he just wants what is best for the country .
OH and you evangelicals , if you are really christian then act like it .
stop spreading fear and hate !!!!
Good tell all your friends to vote for him too .
Bashing Romney does not have anything to do with his religion for most .
This is a primary , primaries get ugly , and it ’ll make the candidate stronger in the end if its Mitt most Republicans @’ will support him
Exactly .
If I were Mitt I 'd be embarrassed by McCain and Sununu out there calling Newt a big meany .
Makes Mitt look like a cupcake .
I 'm a Romney supporter .
I do n't think Newt has earned back any of his lost support with his attacks .
I think if his ads make people back away from Romney their votes will go to Santorum or Paul or maybe Huntsman , not Newt .
But for the most part I think it 's good that Romney is taking the heat now @...
so there are no surprises later and because I think it will prepare him for the showdown with Obama .
i agree with you but can n't understand why Newt is such a cry baby .
he is the one who wants to dish it out but can n't take it .
Oh and being a conservative ?
Throws Clinton under the bus while having an affair .
that just shows him to lack character when this is what we need most .
Romney threw down the gauntlet .
I 'm not watching Newt cry . I 'm watching Newt give Romney back a knuckle sandwich .
Mitt went heavy negative first .
It 's game on now .
And Newt by the way had to pursue Clinton for purgery .
It had nothing to do with an affair .
And actually , Newt defended Clinton 's bombings in retaliation for the attacks on the embassies when everyone else was running around saying President Clinton was just trying to deflect from having to testify .
Tens of Millions Spent to Target Newt Gingrich
By Gary Cohen
of the Iowa caucuses , well @-@ funded so-called super PACs are using the political clout given to them by the nation 's highest court in an unprecedented tour de financial force .
Data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics indicates 264 super PACs have raised more than $ 32 million and spent almost $ 16 million in the 2012 election cycle thus far , The Hill reports .
The lion 's share of the money those groups have spent has targeted former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , according to The Hill .
The impact in Iowa is clear @: Iowa voters are being reminded repeatedly about Gingrich 's ties to Freddie Mac , his divorces , and his lengthy Capitol Hill career .
"@ This is politics @" former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said last week when he reacted to calls for him to condemn attack ads run by the group Restore Our Future .
The Huffington Post points out that those were part of a $ 3.3 million negative ad campaign waged by the group against Gingrich .
Candidates with enough financial clout are able to lay their own groundwork to mobilize voters and remain positive while the super PACS continue to run negative ads , the Huffington Post reports .
Campaign finance observers have been concerned that empowered by the January 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing independent groups to raise and spend unlimited money , such groups would change the balance of campaigns dramatically .
In the past the political battlefield has been overseen by political party organizations and candidate committees .
According to a Huffington Post analysis of independent expenditures thus far this election cycle , super PACs have combined to spend $ 11 million in the Republican primaries , including at least $ 5.8 million in Iowa alone .

I 've got no dog in this hunt Amelia and I 'm loving the battle .
If your man comes out as the candidate not one person can ever , ever say it was a coronation or he got it on a silver platter .
He will have come thru hell and high water to have earned it .
Serious question .
Do you ever actually work ?
Lol , fair question .
Short answer , yes .
I meet with my clients initially to discuss their needs and desires .
Usually that takes several hours .
Then if hired I accompany them to speciality showrooms to pick products .
Then after the products are chosen a design and layout is drawn up .
This can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days depending on the degree of difficulty .
Once physical work begins I help with deconstruction to ensure damage is not done to things that are n't being changed .
I personally do all the framing for any new construction .
I do all the cabinetry and plumbing and most of the electric .
BUT , the actual stone and finish work I do not do much of anymore .
I 've had surgery twice and after the last one I hired a permanent partner to handle the finish work .
While he oversees that I begin working with the next client .
An average job for us lasts anywhere from 2 weeks to a month and a half .
Sometimes we will take commercial jobs that last longer but its mostly high end residential .
I 've been doing this for nearly 25 years and the system I 'm currently using allows me substantial free time .
It 's worked for about the last decade .
I love my job .
Many remodeling jobs simply only allow for so many bodies to fit into the workspace .
Unless business is so slow that its eating into my savings in a major way I work my help first .
They have families and I have loyal help .
It 's a perfect fit for both of us .
Thanks for your curiosity , although I suspect your motives were dubious at best .
Thanks for the answer .
As for my motives @....
well you 're on this site pretty much all day every day , so I really wondered how you can possibly be busy at work .
He bought companies that were in trouble and made sure they failed in a way that made him money .
Still no good way to spin this to seem as if he had an honorable profession that was a credit to good capitalism .
you are showing how naive you are as it pertains to what Bain Capital does .
They seek out failing businesses and do their best to turn them around .
Under Romeny 's watch , they achevied a success rate of 70 % @...
an excellent record .
Without Bain Capital , that 70 % of businesses would have failed @....
LMFAO @.....
made sure they failed in a way to make him lots of money .
You are pathetic .
Serious aye @...
no wonder you come across as an idiot .
Tell me more about Socialist Russia .
Oh wise one .
lol @...
and Greece .
FYI RDD @...
I have decided to retire @...
Ill tell you all about it if you want to know @....
Retire ??
From this site ?
Or from your job ?
PM me .
I follow your logic .
Even today I was out .
A lot of times I post while waiting on clients or simply when I 'm overseeing work underway .
Honestly , most of my work happens in evenings and weekends .
Gotta work around the customers schedule .
You will get a break from me tomorrow as I have cabinets and plumbing to work on all day .
PM sent @.....
from my career @.....
lol @...
Congrats , I hope ?
The poor Obama / OWS supporters , they must be so damn confused on what their Talking @-@ Points should be .
Some come here everyday boasting about how well Wall Street is doing , not realizing they 're supposed to hate Wall Street .
Clearly their Talking @-@ Point signals have been severely crossed up .
Do they love Wall Street ?
Do they hate Wall Street ?
Who knows ?
They do n't even know .
I guess all that HuffPoop and MSLSD stuff is n't helping them much .
Stick around a bit longer and you 're sure to see an Obama / OWS supporter here crowing about how great Wall Street is doing .
It 's pretty bizarre but very funny too .
Boasting about it as Obama demonizes them on one hand and garners campaign funds from them all in the same breath @...
Astounding .
The sheep are confused by the actions of thier herders .
Yeah , there are a few rabid loyal Obama / OWS supporters who routinely come here crowing about how well Wall Street is doing .
It 's hilarious everytime i see them doing that .
They do n't have a clue as to what their Talking @-@ Points should be anymore .
Should they love Wall Street ?
Should they hate Wall Street ?
They 're just so confused .
I guess they see Wall Street doing well as somehow a benefit to their guy in the White House .
So they they 're torn between cheerleading for Wall Street and hating Wall Street .
They just do n't know which Talking @-@ Point to embrace .
Stick around awhile longer and I 'm sure you 'll see a couple of them expressing this confusion .
It 's some fun entertainment .
Indeed .
You try to educate them and it is roundly rejected .
So why not laugh at thier foibles as a consolation prize ?
the OWS mission was the change the narrative from deficits to income inequity .
In that sense OWS was successful .
Actually , it changed the narrative from deficits to "@ hey , look at those trustafarians camping out in the middle of the city , smoking dope , raping each other and shitting all over the place , @" then it went back to deficits .
But at least those brats think they had their own little Woodstock moment , which counts for something , I suppose .
BOOYAH !
OWS changed the discussion .
That alone is a major victory .
If the Dems follow up , and use the real inequities that exist in our system , present remedies for those inequities , we may see some real progress this election .
You do know , do n't you , that your saintlike Dems are perpetuating and profiting from those inequities ?
They do n't give a shit about you , Roxy .
But you just keep blindly pulling that D lever .
No shit .
Voting for the people that are taking advantage @...
stuffin @' thier pockets @...
and '@ the other guys @' are responsible .
The sheep are indeed bleating @...
Useful idiots are useful .
It is slowly recovering on its own despite Obamas policies and business crunching regulations .
I am very glad it is coming around but I just wish we could vote Obama out now to expedite the process .
My prediction is that if Obama loses the election growth will double the current snails pace its growing at .
In fact I bet upon the news alone that he loses the election we will start seeing firms hire and invest exponentially .

<a href="http://www.decisionsonevidence.com/2011/10/do-regulations-curtail-job-growth/"> | Decisions Based on Evidence </a>
the number of layoffs nationwide caused by government regulation is minuscule and shows no evidence of getting worse during the Obama administration .
Lack of demand for business products and services is vastly more important .
Nice quote and all @...
But the concern was that regulations would curtail the hiring BACK of people already laid off @....
not result in further lay offs .
Companies had trimmed themselves down to the bare miunimum @....
no one was really looking at additional layoffs @....
with the exception of companies going out of business .
You quoted an article that does not at ALL address the issue of regulations costing employers money that they may otherwise invest back into the company so they can bring it back tot he size it was before the recession .
The quote does n't , but the article itself does .
It shows that it is a myth that regulations curtail job growth at any signficant level .
This is according to a CONSERVATIVE economist and the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
So sueing companies like Boeing because they want to build in a state his "@ friends @" do n't control is not hurting job growth ?
Or regulating farm dust or putting light bulb companies out of business or stopping oil drilling for so long all the platforms went to other countries instead of waiting or any other numerous stupid decision he has made .
The point is , any economic growth that Obama is inhibiting is miniscule in comparison to other factors .
Rather than blaming politicians , we need to blame the state of the market .
Maybe but he has had a hand in the demise of tens of thousands of jobs .
Minuscule as that may be , explain that to those who have lost out because of him or his administration .
Let me ask you this question @....
If you were about to open a lemon aid stand @...
and your business plan allowed for an 8 % NET profit by the end of your 3 rd year @...
but a large personal investment to start @.....
But there was word coming from Washington that the EPA , with the Presidents blessing , was going to pass new regulations on the purchasing and use of lemons @....
nothing concrete @....
nothing for sure @....
just word going around @....
Would you dive into the venture @...
or wait until you knew what the EPA was going to do ?
He also had a hand in creating close to 3 million jobs .
any given regulation @...
perhaps not @..
But knowing that there is a large influx of regulations @...
and many more to come ?
It is that "@ concern for the unknown @" that stymies economic growth .
Knowiung what the regulation is allows one to compensate @..
and move forward .
Not knowing what is to come and how much it will cost ?
That si what we are referring to @..
And we have a regulation happy administration right now @...
that you can n't deny .
Nonsense .
He has invested in mostly failed enterprises .
There are fewer jobs available now than there were before he took office .
He may have helped "@ a specific @" segment , mostly govt or unions but that 's it .
What regulations would those be ?
I just gave all my employees a 10 % raise and am looking seriously at renting another warehouse .
If you read the article , it also says that Republicans try to perpetuate the myth about the uncertainty businesses face due to regulations .
he took my money and gave it to joe so joe can hire tom to do work that gary and his employee Zach would have done but was n't allowed to do becuase Obama said he wanted Joe to do it with his new employee Tom .
So Gary and Zach lost their jobs and Tom got a job .
Thus why Obama "@ created @" millions of jobs @....
but there are 1.8 million less people working now .
Are you not aware of how that happened ?
oo can i come work for you ?
It is not a myth .
It is real .
It is basic business logic .
You do not make business moves if you can not accurately forecast .
Sort of business planning 101 .
This is what the democrats did to jobs since they took office in January 2007 .
There is no jobs recovery .
Just workers falling of the unemployment rolls .
No jobs have been created .
Just job loss as far as the eye can see .
Umm , okay , so why did n't Tom get the job if Joe wanted him ?
I do not understand what would be stopping him .
It affects small businesses , sure .
Untrue , he created 2.5 million private sector jobs under the stimulus .
OK @...
then you can relate @....
One of my clients was hit with a new local ordnance regarding loading bay width .
Apprarently , some worker at some other company did not follow loading bay rules and tried to walk around the far side of a truck that had little clearance from the wall to the side mirror @....
he nerly took his entire nose off @....
for the truck mirror was damaged and sharp .
So the local legislator pushed for a new regulation adding 6 inches to the width of a loading bay @.....
and it was instituted .
My client had 12 months to comply wioth the new regulation @.....
and as you know @.....
it is pretty expensive to have to widen a loading bay @.....
He did it at a cost of over 75 K @.....
during a year where his profits barely allowed him his basic s-corp salary of 1 K per week @...
and NO distributions @...
so he was forced toactually spend an extra 75 K in a year where he took home only 52 K @...
Ya think he wanted to hire new people ?
The thing people forget , American workers even without unions will never work for what someone in Indonesia will work for .
The one thing we need to do , is not cater to corporations who make their product overseas .
You want factory jobs back , that is the only way that will happen .
That 's where most jobs originate unless your flipping burgers .
you need to be a business owner to understand intitiatives and what is fluff and what is otherwise .
What so if a business needs to borrow , they just should fail , huh ?
if it needs to borrow to stay afloat @...
yes @...
it should fail for its business model is flawed or it would have the capital to stay afloat when times are lean .
It simply means it will ultimately fail with even MORE debt if it borrows to stay afloat · If it needs to borrow to expand @....
then yes @...
it should borrow .
I was against the GM bailout .
It was unfair to Ford who had a soloid business model .
GM blew it and it was rewarded .
Okay , so what should Obama have done for small businesses , in your opinion ?
Day one he should have told them thatthe Bush Tax Cuts woulkd be extended to all .
He should not have cherry picked who got stimulus money @.....
for any small business trying to compete with another small business that got money had no shot in hell .
The stimulus should never have been instituted .
He should have announced on day one that the whole cap and trade thing will not pass under his watch @....
He should have thanked all business owners for their perseverence and hard work @...
not viliified them .
He should have done one of two things @....
either wait until next term to pass healthcare @...
or allowed business owners to know exactly what it will cost them @...
something many of them still can n't figure out and will n't be able to figure out for 2 more years .
Thats a start .
He extended the Bush tax cuts
That is part of being a democrat .
Therefore , there are two sides to the issue .
The private sector saw an increase of 2.5 million jobs under the stimulus .
Villified them ?
That is complete hyperbole .
You may have a point about the healthcare bill .
Obama IS NOT helping the economy to recover , he is slowing its growth
Good luck with that one .
True , but Obama has done a lot for small businesses @:
1 ) He extended loan programs for small businesses .
2 ) He established an initiative for small businesses in rural areas .
3 ) He was half successful in trying to eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses .
4 ) Create a $ 3000 tax credit for businesses adding jobs
5 ) Raise the small business investment expensing limit to a quarter of a million .

The thing about biased sources is basically this @: "@ That may be true , but so is this @...@ @"
Therefore , I do n't take sources like that seriously .
Yes @...
he fianlly did @...
but did n't agree to do it for the business owners until the last minute @....
and low and behold @....
jobs are starting to be created .
Yet there are 1.8 million jobs less than when the stiumulus was passed .
I explained how that happened in an earlier post .
Many companies went OOB becuase they could not compete with companies that got stimulus money @...
and the companies that got that money hired some of those same people that lost jobs when the conmpetitor went under
yes @..
he villifed them .
Have you EVER heard him talk about the great financial risk one takes when they start a business @....
when they hire an employee @.....
did he EVER mention that the last TWO employers of record of an unemployed individual contribute to their unemployment benefits @....
But we have heard the words "@ greedy @" and "@ fat cats @" and "@ unethical @" come out of his mouth when referring to business owners .
And the same point holds true about cap and trade .
My sources are my clients .
I am their business planner / human resource solutions consultant .
I know what held them back for the first two years of Obama 's tenure @..
And I know why some are loosening up now and doing what they can to hire .
Many of them are n't against Obama @...
many like his social initiatives .
But NONE of them feel good about him as it pertains to their business .
Not a single one of them does .
Is he not right about the risk of starting a business ?
Local ordinances have nothing to do with Obama .
If he was renting he could have relocated and avoided the whole thing .
I did n't say it had anything to do with Obama .
I was talking about how regulations have an adverse affect on cpompanies desire to grow .
He owned .
If he had rented he was beholden to a legal contract known as a lease @....
and he could not have simply moved @...
and it wopuldnt have been his responsibility to expand the loading bay @...
such would be the responsibility of the property owner per conditions in the lease .
I am confused @...
you are an employer who just gave 10 % raises to all of your employees @...
but you are not aware of the legal obligations of a lease and who would be responsible for the adherence to local ordanances ?
How is that possible ?
Whether you own or lease , ANY business owner with a warehouse would know who is repsponsible for what as it pertains to physical property legally required alterations .
If he had twelve months to do it and he was leasing he could have easily relocated .
Starting a business has some risks @....
you can eliminate most of them with a sound business plan @....
but you can not control things like weather , natural disasters , and other factors that may affect you at the most critical time @...
your first year .
But even if you have a sound business plan @...
and one that allows for the survival of a slow time @.....
a business owner can not predict what congress and the President may decide @...
Thus why we ( bunsiness owners ) get really pissed off at inititaitves that are brought up in congress and addressed for years @...
for it does n't allow us to forecast properly @..
Like cap and trade .
Will it happen ?
Who knows .
Can it ?
Hell yeah @...
there is already an exchange ready to go to handle it @...
Will it affect cmpanies ?
Heck @...
hundreds iof not thousands will go under within a year @....
So as a result @....
many are assuming it will go through and thus are amassing as much capital as possible now to use to buy its carbon shares when it passes @......
and all at the expense of growing now .
And if it does n't pass ?
Then they wilkl grow when word comes out that it will not pass @...
Until then ?
Wait , see and hoard cash .
But you said your clients were loosening up and starting to hire again .
That means the economical outlook is good ?
Unemployment rates are a lagging economic indicator .
If your clients are starting to hire again , that means recovery has been happening for a number of months now .
how about the forced closing of all those automobile dealerships .
He actually stole people 's livelihood @..
So say those that ruined it .
Democrats took over after 2006 .
And yes they did a mighty fine job driving us into the ditch .
If Bush / Cheney were doing such outstanding employment numbers where did those jobs go ?
Was it a repeat performance of RINO REPUB bank fraud under Bush / Cheney that wrecked the economy then the job market ?
I thought congress was responsible like you guys claim they are now ?
Make up your minds .
Dealers for the most part are n't union employees hence he did n't care .
It would probably help if supposed business owners would actually work instead of posting on internet message boards .
But feel free to continue blaming Obama for your failures .
Useless dribble from a useless skank
You 're not a useless skank @...
you 're good for laughs .
I guess the whole "@ ignore @" thing did n't work out .
Gee , you can n't run your business @....

Oh please @...
Obama 's shut down of the gulf oil platforms cost the region well over 100,000 jobs and caused businesses to either slow their output dramatically or shut down .
Many of those jobs are NOT coming back .
The other issue is how Obama 's supporters can get beyond this tragic statement @.....
10 % unemployment is the new norm @" @...
BS @- and did you forget the crony oil disaster that Obama handled perfectly ?
Boom and bust , scandalous polluters @...
idiocy @...
First , I think I 'd learn how to spell "@ lemonade @" .
The entire uncertainty argument is bullshit .
Could you drop the pig Latin and try English ?
No it is n't @...
What the OP stated is 100 % true .
As a matter of fact , this is an example of precisely why many businesses refuse to expand and many others are not opening .
There is no denying this .
There is no factual rebuttal .
BS . 90 % of the uncertainty is caused by fear mongering and gov't disfunction from Pubs and their gigantic propaganda machine .
"@ No compromise un @-@ American GOP @" ( TIME mag ) No reward for those aholes @....
Yes America @...
If you would only return to electing more republicans we could return to the business environment of 2007 @-@ 2008 where we were LOSING 700,000 jobs a month .
That is how much confidence business had in republicans
Democrats had control then .
I prefer we do n't return to that scenario .
After all they were warned and just ignored it .
No thanks
my gawd , you have to be a real dummy to not think strangling regulations on a company does n't HURT @..
The new GOP / wingnut talking point , now that blaming the bad economy on Obama is n't going to work anymore @:
the economy is recovering in spite of Obama , not because of him .
This is about the 4 th time I 've heard this today already @...
Those goalposts must be pretty heavy , ya think ?
2007 @-@ 2009 is when Democrats were in charge .
They had all the power .
During that time they destroyed a lot of jobs .
Yep , because us Ron Paul supporters are just going to write him in anyway and the GOP establishment would rather put another spend @-@ whore liberal republican or warmonger against Obama .
Grats Obama .
That is all .
Ron Paul can always run third party if he wants to .
But Obama will probably win because you have to have a really compelling reason to vote out an incumbant , and the GOP has n't given one yet .
Try his economic disaster .
The first 2 1 / 2 years he had a democrat congress and he could have done anything he wanted to and he did .
Problem with that argument is
1 ) The economy is finally starting to improve .
2 ) The GOP could be held to blame just as much as he can .
Thats right .
The GOP had better get in line with the living breathing walking and talking human beings instead of the money sucking zero principal profit worshiping fake fucks .
So had the Democrats , in all honesty .
All the recent talk about Obama engaging in class warfare against the rich makes me laugh @...
and it makes me angry .
The rich in this country have n't had it so good since the gilded age .
I 'm not just talking about accumulated wealth .
I 'm talking about having special rights that the rest of us , whether liberal or conservative , do n't have .
Here 's a case in point @:
In July 2010 , Martin Joel Erzinger , a $ 1 Billion hedge fund manager working for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney , was driving his Mercedes near Vail , CO when he hit a bicyclist from behind , seriously injuring him .
Then he sped away without stopping , without calling the police OR calling for an ambulance .
He DID , however , stop some time later @...
to call the Mercedes auto assistance service to report damage to his vehicle and have it towed .
Erzinger committed TWO felonies but was only charged for 2 misdemeanors because DA Hulbert said charging him with felonies would negatively affect his career .
Is that right ?
Would n't that be the same for anyone ?
I mean , if you or I had committed the same crime , would it negatively affect our careers to be charged with 2 felonies .
After all , people DO go to jail for such things .
And people lose their jobs when they go to jail , right ?
You can read about the case below .
<a href="http://www.summitdaily.com/article/20101108/NEWS/101109802/1078&ParentProfile=1055"> DA Hurlbert will n't press felony charges against hit-and-run driver because it might affect his job | SummitDaily.com </a>
In 1970 , the prison population in the US was about 190,000 people .
In 2008 , the US had 2.2 million people in prison .
Today , The Economist estimates that number stands at around 2.4 million people .
That means that today , there are 12.5 TIMES as many people in prison then just 40 years ago .
From which class of people do you think our gov't is sending to prison ?
Ask yourself this question !
Has anyone involved in the financial meltdown of 2008 gone to prision ?
To trial ?
Has there even been any criminal investigation ?
How about when the Bush administration broke the law and engaged in warrantless wiretaps .
They broke the law ?
Any consequences ?
The telecom companies ALSO broke the law .
Congress gave them retroactive immunity .
Remember Iran Contra ?
Bush 41 pardoned 6 Reagan administration officials .
Ronald Reagan issued a pardon to Mark Felt , a former FBI agent , who had authorized the break @-@ ins of homes on 9 separate occasions in a search for evidence against suspected Weatherman Underground members .
They broke into their families homes , as well .
Of course , everyone remembers Ford 's pardon of Nixon .
It might interest everyone to know that France just convicted Jacques Chirac , the former president of France , for corruption .
What happened to America being a nation of laws and not men ?
Today , I guess the powerful do n't need pardons .
That 's because they 're not prosecuted .
There 's no plea bargain because they 're not even charged with a crime .
There 's not even an investigation .
There 's your class warfare .
Nowadays , the rich and powerful rarely get charged with serious crimes .
But if they do get charged , they get pardoned for their crimes .
Or maybe just a commutation of sentence like for Scooter Libby .
And what happens to the '@ lower classes @' who do n't have powerful friends or a lot of money ?
Our gov't throws the book at them , and they get longer and longer prision sentences for ever more minor offenses and victimless crimes .
That 's why the US has the largest prison population in the world , in both numbers , and as a percentage of the population .
For example , China , with a population of 1.3 Billion people only has a prison population of 1,600,000 .
The US , with less than 25 % of their population , has 700,000 more people in jail .
So , please stop trying to make everyone feel pity for the wealthy in this country who are richer than ever and are paying a lower tax rate than they have in decades .
That 's not where the class warfare problem exists .
It exists on the other end of the spectrum .
But if you do n't believe me , if you ever get in trouble with the law , try telling a DA that a criminal conviction would hurt your career .
See how far that gets you .
A very clear miscarriage of justice .
I wonder how much the DA cost to be bought off .
One million ?
Two ?
Ten ?
Whatever the amount was , I hope he sold his soul and his ethics for a high amount .
That case is only one example of a systemic problem that pervades the entire criminal justice system .
Hell , I did n't even mention the fact that rich people can afford better legal counsel .
After all , do you think O J Simpson would have gotten away with murder in the 90 's without his '@ dream team @' ?
I agree on the miscarriage of justice .
laws should be for everyone .
OJ was n't alone .
Robert Blake murdered his wife and walked .
Phil Specter walked the first time .
In California , we have a clause , "@ Not Guilty by reason of celebrity . @"
For the record @: there is no '@ class @' in the United States of America .
It is not a class based society .
'@ Class warfare @' is what politicians use to divide Americans from each other - because that makes it easier for them to rob us all .
Only fucking morons support Democrats or Republicans .
You people are the problem .
You 're confusing the word , "@ class , @" with the word , "@ caste , @"
We do n't have a caste system like India ( or England , to a lesser extent ) .
But we do have a class system .
Money and power are the usual determinants .
It is far more likely that a poor person committing a crime will be convicted , but there 's a lot more to the issue than just convictions .
A wealthy person is less likely to be charged .
If he is , then he will have better lawyers .
If convicted , he will get a lighter sentence .
Once in prison , he more likely to be paroled .
This is nothing new .
Yep , and in the worst case buy a presidential pardon .
California Girl is correct .
We do n't have a Class sytem yet .
That carries major implications within society .
If you are of the upper class in England ( whether you are rich or not ) there are doors open to you that no amount of money will buy entry into .
The same holds true for India as well .
Here in the States you can buy entry through any door you see .
I am sorry for this news to you but this has been the case since @...
well , mankind got '@ organized @' .
Who wrote "@ All animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others , @" and when did he write it ?
justice is sometimes a matter of simply , what you can afford .
It has always been so .
<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/martin-erzinger-morgan-stanley-hit-run-controversy/story?id=12088074"> Martin Erzinger @: Morgan Stanley Manager 's Hit-and-Run Controversy - ABC News </a>
here is another link to the story .
According to this the 2 misdemeanors are due to a plea deal , and the guy is pleading guilty to it .
Furthermore it is his first offense , and no drugs or alcohol were involved .
In most juristictions if it is your first offense you can usually get anything below attempted murder or rape plead down to a lesser charge .
Also , now that he has plead guilty the victim can sue the living shit out of him .
THAT is where the more well off can get slammed by the system .
There will be 100 lawyers willing to take this case , and a deal will n't come cheap for the driver .
If you also read down , the whole thing about not affecting his livelyhood is explained as making sure he can still afford resitution .
Not when someone is seriously injured .
That places it into a whole new level .
My assumption is the scumbag paid a huge anmount to the victim so that he would be OK with the reduced charges , then said scumbag paid a large amount to the DA 's re @-@ election campaign and there you have it .
Justice is served @...
or sauteed if you prefer .
This thread is devolving into the usual "@ Rape the Rich @" bullshit from the mindless left .
That 's too bad , because Mustang touched upon an interesting subject in the OP .
We do have a disparity of "@ justice @" in this nation , a severe one .
The well connected are virtually immune to our laws , Marc Rich was as bad or worse that Bernie Madoff , but a quick bribe to Bill Clinton ensured that he was immune from prosecution for his crimes .
<a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,99302,00.html"> The Marc Rich Case @: A Primer - TIME </a>
Ted Kennedy murdered a girl who was pregnant , assumable with his child , but then , paternity tests were never run , due to his "@ status @" he was never prosecuted .
Bill Clinton openly threatened Betty Currie that if she did not perjure herself he would fire her and ensure she lost her pension .
But since he is a powerful democrat , he got away with it .
Time and again we see that there is one set of laws for the well connected , and a vastly different set for the commoners .
And it is n't just being able to afford high end attorneys .
Clinton was never Criminally CHARGED with witness tampering and racketeering , though absolutely proven guilty , it 's on tape .
Kennedy was never CHARGED with murder , though it 's irrefutable that he did murder Mary Jo .
Back room deals are cut to keep the well connected from even facing a court room .
No need for lawyers because the strings are pulled so that they are n't ever charged in the first place .
This nation was founded on the principle of law , yet we see that this is n't what we have .
Partisans cheer the subversion of the law because "@ their team @" got away with it , and they care only about their party , not justice .
The justice system is a farce and we all know it .
Corruption is the rule , not the exception .
Even at the municipal level the very concept of justice is perverted .
We have traffic laws that exist for no reason other than to fine motorists .
If a man with a gun targets a person purely for revenue , what can we call this other than armed robbery ?
All the way up the chain this goes , judges handing out long sentences to ensure that the prison guard union has plenty of work , in return for donations to keep the judge in office .
In California a woman got a ticket for talking on her cell phone .
The law said it was a $ 20 fine .
So she was fined $ 20 , then assessed a $ 250 processing fee , then an $ 80 court fee .
So was this upholding the law , or just armed robbery ?
Our justice system is rotten to the core , so what are we going to do about it ?
Play "@ Rape the Rich @" games because that 's what Obama wants ?
Should we be occupied with envy and greed like the Shitters , demanding more for Unions and Illegals , or should we really look at the shambles our injustice system is in ?
Come on .
If you guys were riding with us up here in First Class rather than back there in steerage , you 'd take advantage of your status too .
[quote=Mustang;4545988]
I think you 're missing the entire point .
The founding fathers understood that there would be inequality .
And as is often said , they were n't trying to make everyone equal .
However , they DID strive to make everyone equal under the law .
they also understood that equal opportunity was paramount , and , equal outcome would not and should not ever be assured .
The purpose of this thread is two @-@ fold .
First , it 's to dismiss the orchestrated idea that the wealthy in this country are somehow '@ victims @' of class warfare when talk is floated of raising their taxes to help tackle the deficit and debt at the very same time that massive cuts are on the horizon to tackle the same deficit and debt .
Secondly , it 's to show that the REAL class warfare that exists in this country in the criminal justice system actually works in FAVOR of the wealthy and well @-@ connected at the expense of the poor and the middle class .
Our country is supposed to be a nation of laws and not men , right ?
Then why is it that our political and financial elites get pardons for their crimes or their crimes are n't even investigated when a country like France does n't have a problem putting THEIR former president on trial for corruption ?
If our collective ideals are to have any real meaning at all , then we have to practice what we preach to others , and it 's clear that we as a nation are not doing that .
When Ford pardoned Nixon , I think everyone believed ( or at least hoped ) that Nixon 's pardon was a one time exception .
Unfortunately , all it seemed to do is set a precedent for future pardons .
What is ALSO unfortunate , is that while our justice system has become ever more lenient toward the rich and powerful , it 's has also become increasingly merciless to the poor and the middle class because as I noted in the OP , the US has 12.5 times as many people in prison today as we had in prison 40 years ago .
And our population has n't increased by over a factor of 10 in the last two generations .
you can do a lot with numbers as presented the way you did .
You are assuming that becasue there is more people in jail now , than there was 40 years ago it is due to some mass scale of injustice .
can you relate to me how that is , exactly ?
That is the state of class warfare in our society .
The rich are n't victims ; they 're beneficiaries in every sense of the definition .
when a person makes an issue of the earning power and riches of another , absent particular crimes used to amass such , in a society that is upwardly mobile that provides the same playing field for all , what is it then ?
Who is stopping others from becoming the beneficiary of same ?
[quote=Trajan;4550118]
Do you know the great thing about numbers .
They do n't lie .
However , it 's the interpretation of the numbers that matters .
If crime had gone up by 1,250 % in 40 years , that could account for the higher prison numbers .
And if the population of the US had risen by the same percentage , that would also explain the increase in the number of people in prision .
Neithe of those things is true .
And no combination of a higher population and an increase of the crime rate can account for those numbers .
So , it 's something else , is n't it ?
Perhaps you would care to offer an alternate theory .
I still have n't heard any suggestions for a better system .
Unfortunately the corruption in government is so deeply imbedded it will take a revolution to rip it out .
But the new rulers are tactful enough at their game to maintain sufficient balance in wealth and privilege distribution within the lower class that the spark of revolution remains too cool to start the necesary fire .
There is at least one Tory for every four or five prospective revolutionaries .
And a lot of those Tories participate right here in this forum .
Also , the Indefinite Detention bill presently being floored will , if passed , effectively eliminate Due Process and Habeas Corpus .
And while Obama had promised to veto the bill he recently withdrew that promise .
( I am now totally disgusted with that phony sonofabitch . )
The bill will enable the military to detain for an indefinite period , without formal charges or an arraignment hearing , anyone suspected of "@ terrorism , @" whatever that means .
Based on what we 've already seen it 's not hard to foresee it being applied to something like publicly saying , "@ I 'm fed up with this goddam government and I think we need to do something to change it ! @"
"@ Terrorism . @"
Well , we can certainly guess what is not considered "@ terrorism @" by this administration @:

Pols get to walk all the time .
krist just look at the record of anyone in Congress .
I 'd bet at least 75 percent should be in jail .
As wrong as this is , please recall , Kennedy killed a woman and obama executed a citizen w/o a trial .
And no one said or will say shit about it .
Regarding the comment @: "@ Rape the Rich @" from the mindless left .
Let me see if I understand your point of view .
Wealth and power are in fact concentrated to a decreasing number of people ;
Not really .
The the population in the top 1 % , 5 % and 10 % of income earners has stayed pretty static relative to total population since 1990 .
Yes , I oppose corruption .
I have no issue with wealth .
The more wealth created , the better .
I support wealth and oppose corruption .
I 'm the opposite of the democrats , I suppose , who oppose wealth and favor corruption .
HOWEVER , you find it inanely absurd ( to the point that it is mindless ) to think that the same wealth / power is not used to manipulate the law making process , tax code , or financial institutions .
Is that accurate ?
Again , the issue is one of corruption .
Equal justice under the law is the foundation of this nation .
We have lost that , we have distinctly different laws for the well connected than we do for the common people .
Wealth and power often go hand in hand , in the case of the Clintons , the wealth is a by @-@ product of political power .
It is the connections that pervert the law though , not the wealth .
Simply put , I believe that Barack Obama should be held to the same law that Tyrone Jackson in San Bernardino is - and I do n't think you can argue that he is .
I take offense when you call people mindless who would take your very logic , and say "@ Has all wealth and power in this country been earned by the people who wield it . @"
The answer is no .
People love the Bill Gates of this country and have no problem with them .
Coincidentally , most wealthy people who earn their wealth ( like him ) claim that they do n't carry the public burden on a fair level .
The point of those "@ mindless @" people you accuse , is that much of that wealth and power has been accumulated through corruption and exploitation .
Two concepts that led our country to rebel in the first place ( see taxation without representation ) .
The same thing is happening now on a more convoluted level with lobbyists ( powerful ) writing our laws and tax code .
Your logic is somewhat confusing to me is all I 'm saying .
I do n't think Americans HATE rich .
They just do n't like being lied to , cheated , deceived , and exploited .
In the very same way that takes place in our justice system .
Who would n't want to be rich beyond their wildest dreams ?
The conservative misconception is that liberals hate money .
It 's not the money liberals hate @....
it 's the devious means in which some of the rich people obtain their wealth .
[quote=Mustang;4550209]
That 's easy - the asinine war on drugs .
A HUGE section of that prison populous was put there on drug charges .
A crime that is essentially hurting no one but yourself .
I do n't think that the wealthy are '@ victims @' of class warfare and I do n't think that was ever the intent on using that phrase .
It is the poor that are victimized by politicians that pit them against the rich .
The rich are not going to notice the 5 percent that is taken from them in the name of the poor but in reality , nether are the poor going to notice it given to them .
It creates a death spiral of take more and more without really noticing that they are getting nowhere and accomplishing nothing .
The rich are never going to be the victim but the poor are being exploited by the politicians to take the ire from them and move it to a source of income for them to spend .
As far as uneven legal representation , that is a big deal and I am not sure how to further mitigate the problem .
If people were really outraged by this it would change on its own but the fact is that people in general are apathetic morons and simply do not care .
Look at the pass people gave Polanski .
Even HERE people were making arguments for him .
Somehow , people see famous different than the normal guy .
A better jury set for starters and possibly a blind DA .
One that makes the decition to hear a case without names involved or any other information other than the facts uncovered so far .
That would be hard to do though .
Heh , they would have to serve a year in a closed bunker just to get away from the news reports but hey , the military already does that and they would not even be shot at

A wall between private wealth and the state is long overdue ; however , I doubt elected Republicans OR Democrats would agree .
<a href="http://robertreich.org/"> Robert Reich </a>
In the last three decades or so , income inequality has been growing .
While wages are being driven down for a number of reasons , corporate executives are taking ever larger pay and benefit packages , even when they drive their respective companies into the ditch .
Now , here 's a question that I would like someone to seriously try to answer @: Why is it that TALKING about income inequality qualifies as class warfare against the rich , but income inequality , itself , is n't considered class warfare against the poor and middle classes ?
Possibly because for thousands of years the richest members of any society , those who loan money at interest , have consolidated government 's power for their own selfish ends .
Even the American Revolution did n't change that dynamic very much ; central bankers do n't really have to worry about who 's elected to office as long as the private creation and allocation of credit remains safely in their hands .
OWS has already launched the class war into the consciousness of millions of Americans .
Events coming up next summer at the Democrat and Republican Conventions could provoke your question onto the public stage during the closing months of a US Presidential campaign .
If the US economy is swirling the same drain in 2012 as it was in 2008 millions of voters , whose ranks may be swelled by additional millions of eligible voters who do n't usually bother casting a ballot , might decide a "@ choice @" between Republican OR Democrat is really no choice at all when it comes to class war .

I find this fascinating .
Obama 's approval ratings are hovering below 50 % , yet he has made the list for the 4 th year in a row .
To me , this says that Americans are willing to give Obama the benefit of the doubt in 2012 .
Once his re @-@ election campaign is in full gear , his accomplishments will come into the light ( his failures have been made all too apparent by Fox News . )
Perhaps they are starting to realize that the president is n't a cure @-@ all for a damaged economy .
They understand that that there are many other factors to be considered ( i.e. the politics of Congress ) .
That , of course , is just my opinion .
And an opinion based on very little meaningful analysis it is .
The poll asked about 1000 people who they admired the most @: About 170 said "@ Obama . @"
That means 830 admired someone ELSE .
No kidding @...
You do understand the concept of representable samples , right ?
What I find fascinating is @..
Palin came in fourth , and George Bush came in second @..
so because Obama made most admired guy that means the people are going to give him the benefit of doubt @..
It was n't a poll on which President you admired the most @...

then you birds got nuttin to worry about @..
right ?
That 's right .
of course he is .
Hes a good family man and has been a below average President .
Hes a very likable guy and he has my vote .
Not one GOP member can come close to his family values , which is overly ironic at best .
the guy is easy to like and respect , except if you are not of an open mind .
It helps that the media has n't given him the same anal @-@ probing the GOP field has gotten .
Kim Jong Ill was extremely popular in his country .

Blame them not me for that .
See that dot way up there in the sky ?
It 's my point , sailing over your head .
Oh , I got your point .
Out of that list , they picked the best .
No , you missed / purposely ignored the point .
From that list 83 % said someone OTHER than Obama .
good @..
it 's nice to be surprised innit ?
You do realize this is nothing more than a popularity contest right ?
Just look at the names on the list .
There are far better people that should be on there , the Medal of Honor recipients for starters ) .

I would be willing to bet if the question was "@ Which politician is your least favorite @" Obama would be close to the top .
Hillary was polled as the most admired woman in America several years ago , around the same time 51 % of voters said they would never vote for her .
What does that prove ???
It mostly has to do with name recognition and media coverage .
If that were the case , I 'd also be willing to bet that Billy would be the one using my argument

Almost 40 % chose someone that did n't even accumulate 10 votes ( their dog , their cat , their dildo @....
whatever ) .
Most interesting to me was that the 2011 poll had the highest number or respondents say , "@ None @" during the past decade @...
32 % .
LOL , nothing like ignoring the REAL polls @...
so Obama is going to gain momentum ?
well , where did it go in the first place ?
I guess he has n't given enough t.v interviews or taken enough bus trips to campaign on our dime .
Where do you get this information from that Obama uses tax payer money to do interviews and bus trips ?
He has campaign money , you know .
That 's what it is used for .
Every time Obama goes anywhere it cost taxpayers money .
If his campaign tried to cover all the costs they would run out of money in a week .
Think about this .
It is n't hard .
Obama has topped the list 4 years in a row .
Each time they 've used about 1000 people .
Do you really think the same people have answered each year ?
No , they have not .
They make sure to use random samples each time .
No , but it does seem difficult for you to compare 2008 with today .
In 2008 , Obama won the poll with 32 %
Today he won the poll with 17 %
Based on the trend in random sampling , it does n't look good for Obama winning an election in November 2012 .
Next time do n't bring a butter knife to a gunfight .
It does look good actually .
He is even with Romney in most national polls and has a slight lead in some of them .
From here , he is only going to gain momentum .
I though we were talking about the astonishing drop in Obama 's popularity since he became president ?
Now you 're talking about someone named "@ Romney @" who is EVEN with Obama ?
Are you capable of staying on topic within your own threads ?
No , you are n't .
And quite frankly , I can not blame you for wanting to change the subject @: Even I am feeling embarrassed for you @....

Always ?
The Democrat party was also the party that fought for slavery .
Of course , they did n't think slaves were actually humans , so you may still be correct in your statement .
Actually , Medicare itself is the biggest contributor to our debt .
The wars certainly do n't help our financial situation but you do realize the your Democrat president has started a few wars of his own , all unfunded and undeclared by Congress ?
The Bush tax cuts should have been repealed to help pay and we would n't be in this mess
Actually , tax revenues as a percentage of GDP changes very little over time , even as marginal tax rates vary widely .
There is no evidence to suggest that if we had higher tax rates ( no "@ Bush tax cuts @" ) that we would have realized more actual revenue .
In fact , a strong case can be made that we have realized more revenue do to those cuts .
Either scenario is difficult to prove but we certainly know that your statement can not be proven .
And by the way , you do understand that Bush cut taxes for all Americans , not just the wealthy , right ?
The last two points are just flat wrong and we all know it but I have a question for all the pubs / bags -

Its all Bushs fault .
Youre a true idiot if you think Obama is for the working people while he is in a 4 million dollar house in HI
well , it 's partly the president 's fault for not kicking teatard butt so that the bush tax cuts were allowed to expire AS THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO .
but good you have your talking points !
you really need to change your nic @...
the word love in it is just hilarious
The last time tax receipts as a percentage of GDP were below 17 % was in 1959 when they dropped to 16.2 % .
The last time they were below 16 % was in 1950 and 1949 when they were 14.4 % and 14.5 % .
To claim "@ Since WWII , tax revenues have stayed within 15 to 20 percent of GDP @" is completely false and utterly dishonest .
It is more honest and accurate to say receipts average between 17 % @-@ 19 % , and in the 90 's were in the high 19 s and hit 20 by the end .
However you phrase it , we have not seen tax receipts this low as a percentage of GDP since the end of WWII .
That is a fact .
Additionally , you are utterly wrong about Laffer and Reagan .
From 1980 @-@ 82 , by no means economic boom years , receipts never dipped below 19 % of GDP . From 1983 @-@ 1986 , they never went above 18 % !
Just like with the Bush tax cuts , tax receipts went down not up .
Lastly , I am amazed by your spin on the fact that half of Americans do n't pay federal income tax .
If that is n't proof that taxes are their lowest in generations , I do n't know what else to tell you .
You 're simply ignoring reality and history .
I am not in any way amazed by your spin on facts @...
I 've come to expect it .
Nevertheless , let 's take 'em one at a time @:
1 ) Glad we agree that all Americans should pay an income tax .
Chalk one up for bipartisan support .
2 ) Regan 's tax rates included both increases and decreases and were not fully implemented until 1983 .
And what do you know , receipts stayed about the same .
Amazing , is n't it ? !
The people has less taken out of their pockets but the government still got its revenue .
And yes , we stayed within that traditional 15 @-@ 20 percent range .
3 ) So you 're saying I lied because since WWII , we saw 14.4 % in 1950 , which is n't technically 15 % .
You got me .
Mia culpa .
But hey , at the end of the day , I 'm sure your degree in economics and experience in the field outpaces that of Art Laffer @...
I 'm sure .
1 ) We do agree on this point .
However , I 'm sure we disagree on how to go about it .
For the record , I am in favour of raising wages before we raise taxes on the working class .
2 ) Again , no .
You are ignoring history .
After 1983 tax receipts dropped to below 19 % and did not rise above that level until 1997 !
In fact , in 1981 , receipts were 19.6 % and in 1984 they were 17.3 % .
That 's a substantial drop that you are choosing to ignore .
Why is that ?
Oh right , because @...
3 ) You are arbitrarily picking a range .
You 've decided to use 15 % @-@ 20 % , even though since WWII , there are only a couple instances of levels as low as 15 % or as high as 20 % .
If you were being honest , which you are n't , you would use the average and 1 standard deviation , which would get you a range of 16.4 % @-@ 19 % ( 17.7 % being the average ) .
Using that range , you would see we are currently way outside the norm .
As for your hero Art Laffer , you know he drew his famous curve on a napkin as a joke , right ?
It was never meant to be taken seriously .
But , since you are taking it seriously , the least you could do is be honest with yourself .
The Laffer Curve is a CURVE .
Which means on the left side as tax rates drop so do tax revenue levels .
That 's what Laffer was saying and that 's what you are choosing to ignore .
Whether you like it or not , we are on the left side of the Laffer Curve .

Raising wages ?
And who does that ?
Government or the guys that actually own the business ?
That is not a "@ substantial drop @" !
It is a fluctuation that can not be attributed to any one specific tax change @...
and there were changes in rates both up and down .
You 've not supported your point at all .
Bottom line , we took less in taxes and revenues stay about the same @...
which has been the case for 60 years now when rates go down or up .
Pick whatever range you want .
You have no evidence that marginal rate changes have a direct correlation to changes in revenue .
Sorry , you just do n't .
I understand the Laffer curve and yes , we are on the left side of that curve , exactly as Laffer would have predicted in an economic downturn .
You can bitch all you want about tax rates .
There are a hell of a lot of us that are done with the idea of tweaking rates for the benefit of some and the detriment of others .
We want a flat , fair and wide base and most importantly , for the government to live within it 's means .
Deal with it at the ballot box .
says a birther , shut up .
You clearly have no idea what you 're talking about .
17.7 % has been the average since WWII .
One standard deviation below that is 16.4 % .
TWO standard deviations below that is 15.1 % And we are even below that !
Yet , you think this is normal and fine ?
That this is within the acceptable range ?
A range you just made up ?
Apparently someone flunked his college stats class .
When we were over by two standard deviations , Bush went on TV crying over how the government was taking in too much money and had to give it back .
Now we 're on the other side the same way @...
and you do n't care .
You choose to ignore it like every other "@ conservative @" .
Way to go .
You do n't understand the Laffer Curve .
It does n't change based on the strength of the economy .
Do some reading .
Your ignorance is showing .
i know @...
one of the stupider , nastier rightwingnuts on the board @....
but she 's got loooooooooove .
lol @..
who gets her money through a socialistic structure @..
I hope you are right as my daughter hates her job and I would like to see her find another .
Companies have been holding cash for a while now and without demand , there is no need to hire .
They are making a profit without new employees .
Other bad signs for the economy are @:
-@ the downward adjusted housing numbers · -@ paltry GDP numbers · -@ real unemployment rate
Good news though include @:
-@ consumer confidence is up · -@ durable goods numbers up
What this great country needs now is the two sides to stop pushing agenda items and start making decisions that make economical sense .
Your daughter should start looking now .
Tell her to get a good resume together and start submitting them online .
Having a job is easier then not having one when looking .
Employers like hiring people away from other firms .
First @..
it 's almost a seamless transition and second , if it 's a rival then all the better .
And the "@ profits @" they are making are accounting tricks .
It does n't last forever .
And really , it 's them that started the loss of demand .
For two reasons .
They wanted to cut high labor costs by hiring overseas and creating a glut of people looking for work .
Initially layoffs had nothing to do with loss of demand .
It was "@ synergy @" .
Eventually @..
that 's what started to happen , because UE got so high .
But now @..
even the Chinese factories are in trouble because people are not buying their cheap crap .
Thus , people are starting to look for government solutions to the problem .
And quite frankly , alot of things need to be done .
Infrastructure , implementing new tech like cloud and IPv6 , and high speed rail .
However @..
that could tighten the high tech / engineer market again .
Which would be bad for alot of these companies .
Which is one reason I think a hiring boom will happen .
What better time to snap up well trained peeps who 've been out of work for awhile .
And they get them on the cheap , while looking like "@ heroes @" .
In other words - Sallow is hoping for another mass bailout and enormous government spending .
But no worries @...
Obama wants to cut 3 $ trillion out of the deficit in 10 years ( which will of course increase the deficit not decrease it )
Will do , thanks for the advice .
These are just musings @..
but lately there 's been alot of frenzied activity from recruiters .
And I just went to the office party of my old job and while talking to some of the guys there , many people who were looking for a year or more are getting snapped up .
What 's going on ?
Well aside from the economy getting better , the Bush tax cuts are set to expire .
And there 's not much evidence they did anything to help .
Employers are sitting on tons and tons of liquidity and playing "@ shell games @" to keep making money @..
without adding to the overall economy .
Given the present anger in the public at large , I have a feeling that to quell some of this @..
there will be a hiring boom .
Who knows @...
I do n't think you 'll see a "@ Hiring boom @" till after the 2012 elections and that would depend greatly on the outcome .
of course you think that willow .
Tell us when the last time you were right in a prediction ?
we 'll have to wait and see will n't we dog breath .
you have made them before , did you ever get one right ?
Actually @..
some states are doing what the Fed will n't @..
and adding Stimulus .
New York State just wrapped up a huge deal with Cornell @..
<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/cornell-wins-bloombergs-nyc-tech-campus-heres-what-the-2-million-square-foot-school-will-look-like-2011-12"> Pictures of proposed Cornell Technion NYC engineering school </a>
And Cuomo kiboshed the idea of killing the millionaire 's tax in favor of putting together a package of infrastructure projects .
And walking around the city you can see construction is booming .
I assume you have noticed that colleges have been in a massive growth boom for the past 7 @-@ 8 years .
School construction has never been better .
And who could be surprised ?
We are just now beyond the height of the education bubble created by the government .
And it will burst .
And it will be ugly when it does .
I would think you would not be in favor of this .
I would assume you do n't like how tuition has ballooned in the past decade ?
What exactly are you basing this on ?
On another blog several years ago I said corporations would n't be hiring for a while for a number of reasons .
-@ They wanted to cut benefits and wages .
-@ They wanted to make the President look bad to loosen regulations or get another guy in office .
That position got slammed @..
but it turned out to be pretty true .
They are n't hiring .
But not for the reasons you state .
You imaginarium is running along the paranoid lines .
I 've seen many small business owners interviewed and have listened to many who are members here on this board @..
A. Thousands of anti business regulations from obama
B . obama care and the associated costs .
c. Uncertainty in an anti business enviornment .
D. They 're not look forward to the expiration of the Bush tax cuts .
so , , we 'll wait and see who is right .
A. Which ones ?
B. Cost of Healthcare was rocketing up prior to ObamaCare .
Employers were asking for more of a contribution from Employees .
C. What "@ Anti @-@ Business @" environment ?
Did interest rates suddenly spike ?
Several rounds of QE were "@ anti @-@ business @" ?
D. Read my OP .
Outstanding point .
and why would an employer hire new employees that he may have to lay off later and then know he 's going to have to pay unemployment benefits for a lifetime ?
who in the hell would knowingly do that ?
Please .
Stop .
Talking .
bullshit and spin .
that all you got ?
No .
ewe stop talking .
Has the amount of millionaires and billionaires in this country gone up or down in the past 30 years ?
Seriously @..
come into the real world .
I hope you are right cause we need a hiring boom , alot of people are out of jobs and need the work .
With that kind of attitude why hire anyone ?
that business would be a one man shop .
Plus unemployment is hardly a life time , it varies depending on state but there is always an expiration date on that .
What spin ?
I address your points and asked some questions .
Point out the "@ falsehoods @" @...
if you like .
Try using some real world facts to buttress your position .
Personally , I am seeing some fairly significant movements in the Real Estate market .
It appears the stockpile of the foreclosures is finally beginning to disappear .
Plus , commercial investors are coming back to the table .
2012 may be a year of unexpected recovery .
that 's obama 's cross to bear .
poor him .
Like me .
The country producing more millionaires should be celebrated , but that 's jmo .
A company that hires through a temp service .
A temp service always has 2 customers , at least .
One to bring people in for the pay .
And one that just sucks that almost no one will take .
When the big payer ends , the temp co can offer the worker the shitty job , hoping they will n't take it , so it 's a voluntary quit and thus no UE >
What kind of work do you do ?
It 's no "@ bubble @" .
The world comes to the United States to educate it 's people .
The United States Colleges and Universities are top flight @..
bar none .
Great time to add another fee to those taking out mortgages then .
Why ?
I was application support for trading and market data systems .
I also helped build out NOCs , RNOCs , contigency floors and data centers .
I was the SME for a proprietary application that we sold to customers .
Before that I did consulting for application and hardware migrations .
I have admin level experience with HPUX , SUSE , and RHEL .
Applications and OS 's that I am familiar with include TIDAL / BIG BROTHER / HP Openview / TANDEM NonStop / Remedy / Service Now / Tripwire / Perforce .
I 've trained ITIL v1 , v2 and v3 .
I can write PERL / KSH scripts and use SQL . And I just completed a CCNA class @...
so I am studying to take the certification test .
That @..
and I make a really mean omlette !
Well @...
for starters @.....
If you look anything like your avatar , I think I may know what your problem is and why you can n't find a job .
I just copied and pasted your qulifications on a word doc .
I am going to make some calls to people I kow that do tech and see if your qualificatiuons are something they may be able to present to a client .
If I get any positive repsonse , I will PM you @...
and do something I am very much against doing @...
but would do iot for you @....
give you my personal / business information .
And if I do @...
just an fyi @...
I have a very vicious puggle guarding my house .
Hey thanks !
The offer to have you buy me a beer still stands .
Who said anything about unemployment for life ?
they keep extending it , , what do you think that means ?
soon there will never be a satisfactory cut off point .
OMG @....
there is no way you just denied that education is a bubble market right now .
You did n't .
Wow .
I suppose you can call anything a bubble if you like @..
and point to things to support your point .
My understanding of a "@ bubble @" is a sector that is artificial propped up @..
despite weak demand .
Like the "@ Housing @" bubble at the beginning of the Bush administration .
There is Strong demand for US education .
And that 's world wide .
Low cost loans , credit not a problem .
Try thinking beyond that .
Add state government increasing funding to buy votes .
One Result is higher tuition .
But those teachers deserve all that money and perks on the tax payer dime right ?
There is !
There is !!!
It 's called WW3 .
Here 's dougie downer to shoot to pieces another thread .
Why the heck are you so unhappy .
You 've got a real cute "@ rent-a-wife @" and live in the tropics .
Yep .
People are just standing in lines waitin @' to become teachers .
Hoo boy .
And cab drivers too !
Although I think cab drivers pay slightly better .
Actually , as an owner of a temporary placement agency ( we are a business planning and human resources solutions firm in the NYC area ) , it does not actually work that way .
We can not offer a temp a lower salary and then deny him / her unemployment if he / she rejects the assignment .
It willbe a valid rebuttle and we would lose .
Furthermore , we would never want to alienate a good tempoorary employee with such an act .
Maybe some of the smaller shops that try to maximize revenue at the cost of quality service do @...
but as someone in the industry for over two decades , 75 % of that time as an owner , that is only successful for the short term .
For your inventory ( temps ) is at a constant and constantly rotating in and out .
You need to grow inventory to grow revenue .
What many people do n't realize is we value our temps as much as we value our clients .
We must perform superior customer service for all of them .
I never had any luck with the temp agencies , one time I got a voice mail from one of them saying they had a job for me .
I called back , and the lady said sorry since you did n't answer we offered the job to the next person on the list who answered the phone , that did n't make any damn sense to me .
Part of our business is very time sensitive .
We may get a call from a client saying that they need something and called another service as well @..
and the one who performs the quickest gets the order .
We explain that to our tempos when they apply with us so they understand the importance of always being reachable @..
to the best oif their ability .
We have some temps that make great money with us .
Great relationships .
We give them bonuses this time a year .
Last few years they were n't overly impressive @...
but the appreciation was there @...
and returned with GREAT quality and a great representation of our firm .
I suggest you spread yourself out .
It is a matter of establishing yourself with one who sees your differential @...
whatever it may be .
Present yourself as confident , reliable , and willing to do whatever you can to represent them at the highest of levels @.....
do n't make it like "@ I need to make money @...
or @....
im desperate @...
Im doing this only so unemployemtn sees I am looking for a job .
Instead , make it like you are an asset to them @.....
not that they are an asset to you .
You will find you are treated with great respect with that typoe of approach .
lol .
If I help you find a job , it will be my pleasure to buy you a beer .
Just say , the topic is beyond your understanding and its all good .
Great move having government take over loans and reduce the payment .
You will be paying longer and more interest .
Then you are the only one , or the laws in PA are different .
I do n't know if the laws are different .
But the unemployment rep has the authority to apporve or denyt unemployment .
It is not black and white .
Conditions , circumstances , outside forces are considered @...
and there is always sympathy for the one making the claim .
The only people we deny unemployment to are ones that refuse to take an assignemnt at their rate three times in a row .
And we document every event .
Beyond my understanding ?
My mom just retired .
She was a teacher .
She started out with shit pay @..
long hours and lots of long nights .
She had to get her masters .
That and I 've had a few friends that were college professors .
One guy did it during his time searching for another radio producer gig .
He taught one class and was done .
Shit pay @..
So yeah @..
I have first hand experience with it .
they have in place in most companies cutters and slashers .
This only works for a few years .
They cut and slash their way in a bloated system to profits .
At some point there is no more fat to cut .
The corps will settle for profit any way its made .
When slash and burn is done you have to make profits some way .
At the point that they need to hire to make more profits they will hire .
No republican tricks like trashing the debt ceiling or refusing tax cuts to the middle ( EVEN while they claim they are all about tax cuts ) will stop the corps from finding profits .
Unfortunately for the right we have about hit the point where to make more profits the corps are going to have to hire .
While the republicans will do ANYTHING for corporations you see the corporations are not as devoted to the republicans .
They will not hold back jsut to help you get elected if there are profits to be made .
You serve a disloyal mistress cons .
Who would have thought that TM was a Captain of Industry ! ?
"@ we have about hit the point where to make more profits the corps are going to have to hire . @"
We have , "@ Hit the point ? @"
What "@ point @" would that be ?
I thought the only way to Save An Economy was to raise taxes .
and allow government to "@ create @" jobs using a Massive Stimulous Package ?
I 'm all good now I got a full time job with the feds .
No , you had SECOND Hand experience .
You never actually were a teacher @: This would have given you first hand experience .
Eventually we 'll all be good with "@ a full time job with the Feds . @"
Mr. Obama ?
Is that you ?
If it is , you 're going to be losing that job in about a year .
So you may want to consider my advice .
My tongue was planted firmly in my cheek , referring to the new fee in the payroll extension that dings folks getting or renewing mortgages .
Insignificant
My understanding of a "@ bubble @" is a sector that is artificially propped up @..
Um @...
what ?
Using your definition - there was no housing bubble .
A bubble is a market that is artificially propped up for any reason .
Including creating an ARTIFICIAL demand .
Education demand is false .
It is not reality .
We have eons of kids who could n't graduate high school getting 4 year loans including room and board .
No college in their right mind would accept these kids in the past , and not one bank would give them a loan prior to the government guaranteeing the loan .
Colleges are filled with kids who do n't belong there .
And the only reason they are there is because of insane student loan practices that are identical in everyway to the insane mortgage loan practices .
to you maybe .
20 bucks a week is n't ?
Especially when you give 1 week a month back if you ever get or renew another mortgage .
Yer gonna make every Liberal 's Head Explode with that kinda reality .
I did teach a Tae Kwon do class @..
and a Gymnastics class once @..
Does that count ?
Okay @..
I stand corrected .
So you helped little boys do back hand spings , back flips with full twists and @...
dare I say @.....
back bends ?
Mr. Sandusky ?
Is that you ?
Since I was a public school teacher , I 'll let you pass .
How do you figure that ?
How did I know that was coming ?
Again @...
I am not just talking about domestic demand .
And I am surprised by the "@ Kids who do n't belong there @" crapola .
Every American kid belongs in college .
In any case @..
Bush cut taxes @..
and lowered interest rates to zero .
That @..
and the deregulation brought about by the loss of Glass @-@ Steagall created a plethora of predatory loan companies .
That 's a real bubble .
Do you know something that I do n't know about the power of the president ???
The only way I see any president influencing the economy in a good way is by representing populist opinion that is based in sound economic theory .
Aside from the power to veto and the command of the military the president is not intended to have all that much actual power .
He is totally dependent on the congress .
I just want to see your thoughts behind your statement , if you have any .
I am also interested to know what candidate you think would best fill the role that you have in mind .
Ron Paul is the only one I see with any real plan that is within his power and is totally doable even with the '@ do nothing @' congress .
Returning all the troops home from any country that requests it would be one hell of a start .
Thats 200 @-@ 300 thousand people with good middle class jobs moving into every neighborhood in the country .
The border will be secured , which will cause the value of labor to rise .
Plundering of the treasury and destruction of the dollar will be halted through the power of the veto .
A competing currency will be introduced , although that must go through congress so there is little hope presently .
Inflation will continue for years however as the market finds equilibrium from the 97 % erosion of dollar values .
Most important is the reductions in spending .
Consider the 1 trillion in cuts a start .
1 trillion is kinda a magic number , its just enough to start seriously addressing the debt .
Overnight confidence the dollar will begin surge .
So this is going to effect the market hard and fast in three very good ways .
Purchasing power of the general public is going to rise , regulations that prevent competition and expansion of economy will be reduced , and lower taxes .
If we bring all the troops home with no bases overseas , I see a big cut in Military personnel so there will n't be that many people spending money here like you say , if we do n't maintain a presence overseas we will n't need a Military of this size .
"@ Every kid belongs in college @" - that is a huuuge pile of dog poo .
A kid who can n't ( for whatever reason ) hack high school in no way will be successful in higher education .
That is really dumb thinking Sallow .
And another thing @....
the housing bubble started in the Bush admin ?
Come on @...
I would expect better from you than that .
That is T-M and Rdean speak .
Started ?
No @..
not completely .
But it went into overdrive with Bush .
When Romney talked about letting some mortgages lapse to clear the market @..
that should have occurred at the beginning of 2001 .
And kids not "@ hacking @" high school @..
do so for any number of reasons @..
that need to be addressed .
Unless there is some physical deficiency @..
no one is born stupid .
Sigh @....
it is this kind of thinking that is destroying education .
Liberals not wanting to admit that not everyone is cut out for higher education .
Liberals modifying testing results because they do n't like the image it presents .
Liberals giving wholesale passes to minorities who are failing their class but refuse to give them failing grades , and do everything in their power to skew the grading curve so that you would practically have to rape a fellow student , in class - to fail .
BOOOOOSH !!
For Christssakes .
Barney Frank and the Dem Congress were on vacation for 8 years ???
I wish you Partisan shites would fucking pay attention .
Maybe if I made it Simple @:
Since 1945 , The Republicans only controlled BOTH the Presidency and the Senate and the HoR for FOUR ( 4 ) YEARS ; during the 108 th and 109 th congress .
Housing and construction are the backbones of this economy .
They are both showing improvement and the confidence level is improving .
I think many economist may be surprised at the amount of growth we will see by year 's end ( 2012 ) @....
or the world could come to an end .
From what I 've seen or read , most economists do not expect GDP to be much higher than 2.5 % , some think closer to 2 % or even lower .
That ai n't going to translate into a hiring boom .
Wish it would happen , a lotta people need a job , but I 'm not seeing it .
The interesting thing is , there are MANY job openings .
So why can n't they be filled ?
You show me a bunch of women that worked in a bank in Atlanta , GA , and ask them to drive 18 wheelers in North Dakota during January , then I 'll show you a bunch of unemployed people .
Some of the jobs are low paying manual labor that many people do n't want to do , especially if they 're getting a UE check .
Some jobs require a specific skill that most people do n't have , and again , those that do are collecting that UE check .
No doubt there are other reasons as well .
And they did n't have a filibusterproof Senate either .
I 'm sure you 're right .
However , most UE pays for JOB TRAINING .
So , if you do n't have the skill ( driving an 18 wheeler ) , you can be trained .
You are correct @: It 's easier to sit in a park in NYC and bitch @-@ and @-@ moan than to learn a skill that is marketable .
BTW if anyone IS interested in doing more than "@ protesting , @" Boulder County will pay for your $ 4000 , 3 week , truck driving class .
Of course you gotta have a clean UA , and a good driving record .
Starting pay is about $ 40 K / yr
Experience maxes out at about $ 80 k / yr.
Soon there will be no way to hide the bad economy .
No amount of fuzzy numbers will cover it up .
Some experts predict things will get worse at the beginning of 2012 .
People get lazy when they think the government can come and save them .
Thing is who 's going to save the government with the bottom falls out .
why ?
lets get back to the hiring boom .
please detail what you would consider a hiring boom , I am curious .
His over @-@ reliance on diplomacy with Republicans has been costly for critical progress .
That being said , I do think he is a good president Let me explain why I did n't choose the other options @:
1 ) I think Obama shares the blame a little on the slow recovery of the economy , but I think there are many factors to be considered ( i.e. , congress )
2 ) I think his foreign policy has been great
3 ) Despite Solyndra , his energy policy has been quite successful
4 ) It was Bush that supercharged the defict ( although some of the blame does go to Obama , too )
5 ) His taxation policy would have been great had it not been for what I chose out of this poll
6 ) National Security has undoubtedly been his best work ( even Fox News can admit that ) .
Please explain your choice .
His foreign policy has been abysmal .
Today , thanks to Obama , we 're leaving Iraq in shame .
The troops are just glad to be leaving , but everyone knows Obama intentionally screwed the pooch there .
Nobody likes us .
At one time everyone thought that Bush was hated , but Obama has taken hatred of America to a new level .
It 's time we got this childish OWS out of the White House and put somebody responsible back at the helm .
You have absolutely no perspective whatsoever .
For one thing , polls show most Americans ( including most Republicans ) agree that ending the war in Iraq was a good idea .
No he has n't .
He has never publicly supported the OWS .
He 's been a weak leader who has divided this country .
He is like a liberal Bush .
Who are you to talk ?
Can you come up with an objective approach ?
No , because you are too biased .
Meaning I should n't talk ?
Sorry , but you do n't skate on this one .
And I certainly do n't answer to you .
Any promise or objective can be set up correctly with measures .
As to weight , that depends on your point of view .
But , Politifact holds no sway if people do n't agree to the measures to begin with .
And this is n't about dissing Politifact .
They are simply reporting .
But they report raw numbers and to allow you to hold those up as being meaningful would be a mistake on our part .
Do you want to support your statement that I am too biased .
Or is this just a smokescreen because someone is calling you on your supposed "@ logical @" approach .
You calling it useless without giving good reason why or coming up with an alternate source of analysis on his promises , makes you biased .
The raw data speaks for itself .
Obama has succeeded on most of his campaign promises .
I do n't need an alternative to show you methodology to be flawed .
And for someone who has critical thinker in his / her avatar , it is obvious you do n't know what that means .
And attempting to use it to prove bias is almost laughable .
Well , actually it is laughable .
There may not be a way to actually meaningfully measure his promises kept .
Raw data , espcially in this case , would need to be processed .
Just looking at the numbers is meaningless .
Creating 5 million jobs huh ?
Want to cite that .
And investing in green tech .
He has not invested a dime in green tech .
What he has invested in is companies .
Companies that are going to go with the status quo as long as they can sell it and are going to resist all efforts to push green tech any further than immediate profits .
This is the problem that I have with government '@ investment @' in technology .
That investment should begin and end with straight out research grants that are awarded to people that are purely in it to push the technology .
Companies do not need incentive for R&D .
they will do so as long as they can make a profit .
In that regard , no matter how much you give them , it will not change their R&D goals .
On the other hand , the government must invest in technology because it is the ONLY entity that can invest billions pushing a tech to the next level and shrug the losses off .
This is even more true in cases where no benefits are actually realized .
See NASA for situations where government investment in technology has pushed the envelope .
Investing in companies in the tech industry is NOT the place of government and does not end well .
Establishing an energy policy with Brazil does some good .
Stopping American drilling does far more bad .
<a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/439/create-5-million-green-jobs/"> PolitiFact | The Obameter @: Create 5 million "@ green @" jobs </a>
1 . You dodged all but the first sentence of my post .
2 . Your link does not substantiate your claim .
Until the BLS completes these surveys , the exact number of newly created green jobs is open to debate .
The Council of Economic Advisers -- which advises the president on economic matters --@ claims that 225,000 green jobs have been saved or created through the first nine months of 2010 .
Claims .
Yes , THAT 'S convincing verbiage .
As of yet , there is simply not enough data to accurately gauge the progress in green job growth .
Because of this , we continue to rate this promise as In the Works .
225 K is nowhere near a million .
Even more so because it is essentially a guess .
We also need to include the fact that the goal posts were moved from creating those jobs to now created OR saved .
Heap that on top of the fact that the numbers of created or saved jobs has essentially been a farce through the economic downturn and you have nothing on that claim whatsoever .
True , I was quoting Obama .
However , I bet his estimate will come close .
We will have to wait and see .
We are running out of the fuels we have .
We need to invest in alternate forms of energy .
Is gov involvement the best way to go ?
No , but it 's a start .
Energy companies are n't going to do it .
I never said it was perfect .
I just challenged you to come up with something better .
For now , it is best source we have .
I picked the economy .
I picked it because instead of using his political capital at the beginning of his presidency to adress jobs , unemployment , the budget defecit , and the national debt he used up all that capital getting Obamacare passed .
The double whammy is Obamacare has actually , unlike it was intended to according to those who supported it , hurt the economy and the national debt along with cutting medicare .
If Obama had been even more antipathetic to Republicans than he already was , the backlash from the people would have been even stronger than the profound levels it reached in 2010 .
Obama 's version of bipartisanship is like an abusive parent offering their child candy while slapping them in the face .
It was a recipe for schizophrenic government , which is what we have now .
Obama is a failed leader .
The bias of your poll , Billy , was obvious .
When I saw your longest entry , I guessed what your choice was without you explaining it .
Anyone claiming obama has n't been partisan toward conservatives and republicans is either blind or a far left liberal .
I also picked the economy , for more or less those reasons .
If Obama had paid more attention to how the stimulus was used and to making HAMP work as he said it would , then the recovery could have been much more robust .
What would have happened if Obama had taken his supposed zeal for infrastructure and actually put some effort into backing that in 2009 ?
Instead he neutralized most of the positive effect the stimulus and his other programs could have had by spending all that time on Obamacare .
It has been a raincloud over the economy .
It 's not a failure so much as a deception .
Obama campaigned in 2008 as a progressive , and the people who voted him into office believed that 's what he was .
I remember being thrilled at how many small donations he was receiving , and thinking naively that maybe this was a way around corporate dominance of the government .
Boy , was I wrong .
Down the list , almost every "@ failure @" of the Obama administration can be seen instead to be deliberate policy .
For example , Obama is believed by some to have shown weak leadership on health @-@ care reform , letting Congress craft the bill for him .
But when it looked like no reform was going to pass , he demonstrated that he had the ability to twist arms and guide the process to what he wanted .
So what does that mean ?
It means that he let it go as long as it was going the way he wanted , and took an active role when it looked like it was n't .
He was n't "@ weak @" on this @: he was corrupt .
He got a health @-@ care reform bill that his campaign contributors , who included health @-@ insurance companies in large amounts , could be happy with .
Obama is the reason we do n't have a public option .
If he 'd intended there to be one , we would have one .
Look at who he appointed to key economic positions in his Cabinet @: Wall Street cronies and tools , architects of center @-@ right corporate @-@ friendly economic policy , Clinton @-@ era DLC retreads .
The Republicans did not pressure him into appointing Geithner as Treasury Secretary , nor did he need their approval to do so .
He did that on his own initiative .
Barack Obama is simply not the progressive friend of the people that he claimed to be in 2008 .
And THAT is his biggest failing .
Bingo .
As I said .
Running for POTUS is a whole hell of a lot easier that being POTUS.Especially when you do n't have the skills for it .
These same people did n't seem to have a problem when there was a campaign going on to pull ads from the Glen Beck show .
Go to Lowes and shop folks .
It 's still a free country and I do n't care what their reason are for pulling their ads .
It 's no ones business .
wow @...
I do n't remember a "@ campaign @" of any sort @...
I think Beck dug his own grave with his false version of Christianity and his outlandish nature .
There was a concentrated effort on the part of the left , led by Media Matters , to get advertisers to pull their ads from Beck 's show .
Which I personally have no problem with .
Beck is a horrible human being .
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/11/showbiz/all-american-muslim-lowes/index.html"> Lowe 's pulls advertising from TLC 's '@ All @-@ American Muslim @' - CNN.com </a>
Lowes pulled an ad they had placed on All @-@ American Muslim essentially claiming that the show was to controversial .
Now they are getting a lot of flack claiming that they are upholding an anti Muslim bigoted attitude .
As I understand it , the show is based around AMERICAN Muslims and the struggles they are facing in a post 9 / 11 America .
While I have no issues with how Lowes decides to advertise , this does seem like a bone headed move particularly considering that I would have never even known about the show in the first place until Lowes created this controversy .
Many people are now calling Lowes Bigoted for this move .
Your thoughts ?
They are free to do this .
And they should n't complain or ask for federal aid when they experience a backlash .
Elaborate , please .
huh @..
You 've turned into a regular little fascist
I completely agree with both points .
However , I personally would not have pulled the ad 's unless the ratings were lower than I wanted them to be for a time slot my commercial would air .
Why ??
I would have pulled the ads just because the show was horse shit and a mockery of our freedom , hence no one wanted to watch it @..
Quite frankly I would have never advertised with the program to begin with @...
The whole concept was an oxymoron from the start @..
Not that they will , but why should federal aid be linked to whether a company is "@ politically correct @" or not .
There 's only one good reason why a company should get a bailout , and that 's if the consequences of its sudden collapse would be more economically disasterous than just letting the market take its course , and if it has a reasonable change of viability after the bailout in order to pay the money back .
Federal backlash ???
What the fuck does that mean Stalin ??
Do you expect Obama to sue Lowes ???
hahahaha
You 're one dumb motherfucker @...
Thanks for showing how authoritarian progressives are @...
The show is just propiganda .
They want to show us how Muslims are misunderstood victims .
Next time i need to shop for some tools , fuck home depot , I 'm going to lowes .
IMO , Lowes is way better anyways , I appreciate their position but they have what I need all the time unlike Home Depot @...
Sometimes they both suck @...
lol .
I needed a spotlight fixture for my Christmas lights ( just the holder on a spike ) .
Lowes was out .
Home Depot was out .
Sears was out .
Target was out .
K-Mart was out .
The little mom & pop True Value a block from my house that I never shop at had about a hundred in stock .
Sure , they were $ 3.00 more than the others would have been @...
but they HAD them .
I 'm certain the entire hypocritical land of left wing lunatics will label Lowe 's bigoted and are even threatening a boycott .
This is a free country .
Lowe 's should be able to spend their advertising dollars when and where they want to without being accused of bigotry .
I 'll continue to make it my store of choice when I need home improvement .
Come on , how many of the progressives that are outraged over this do you think can even swing a hammer ?
Or have the ambition too ?
good point .
Very comical to watch .
Interesting to see how many conservatives think Lowes only carries hammers @...
( BTW , this progressive helped build the house I live in and the house my parents live in @...
but do n't let that keep you from making idiotic comments like the one above for Willow to froth over
However , I have already heard one radio ditto head ( Pete Dominick ) call for a boycot so they are already on that train @....
Hey , I 've met the odd progressive who does n't swing a hammer like the obama throws a baseball , just not too many .
There 's an "@ All American Muslim @" show ?
I did n't know that .
I 'm German - how about an "@ All American Kraut @" series for us ?
Did n't you watch "@ Hogan 's Heros @" as a kid ?
With almost 30 years in the business , there is much truth to his statement .
Every stereotype has exceptions .
They have a right to spend their money where they set fit .
They do .
If they pulled it because they did n't like the subject matter of the show , that 's kind of wrong .
I mean , this is the network that gave us the Jon and Kate and the shows about the midgets , which is a lot more obnoxious than a show about Muslims .
If they pulled the ads because no one was watching the show , then it 's a sensible business decision .
As far as I can tell , ratings had nothing to do with it .
It was centered solely on the fact that the subject matter was Muslims and they were getting a lot of feedback with strong opinions on the subject matter .
Go figure .
As I said , it was a dumb move on their part as no one would have ever found out about the ads other than those that watch the show .
They obviously do not care about the controversy .
Now many people are pissed .
Not sure if I care at all myself but I did want to see some opinions / discussions of the people here .
Many are calling it a racist move but I do n't think that a company of that scope makes decisions on this scale with a racist intent .
They have far too much money on the line .
It seems they did not think it through though .
What part of this are you having trouble understanding ?
"@ Lowe 's has received a significant amount of communication on this program , from every perspective possible .
Individuals and groups have strong political and societal views on this topic , and this program became a lightning rod for many of those views .
As a result we did pull our advertising on this program , @" the company said in a statement Saturday .
None .
Where have I stated anything that would lead you to believe I do not understand their statement ?
I do n't have a Lowe 's near me but Home Depot does suck .
I went in to buy some half inch by six lag bolts and they had none , I mean none at all .
Those lags are one of the staples of construction and are required by code and there were none .
I went in yesterday and they were out of 15 amp circuit breakers .
I am hoping a Lowe 's will be built nearby .
It appears Kayak.com also pulled their ads , but they cited the poor quality of the show .
Great point .
Especially since being a Muslim is a nationality just like being German .
LMAO !!
And I thought I had run into stupidity before .
Social security is so the elderly , poor and infirm will n't have to go to a county poor farm to die and end up in an unmarked grave .

<a href="http://www.koco.com/r/29979321/detail.html"> @- Oklahoma City News Story - KOCO Oklahoma City </a>
First , I think that the payroll tax cut is a bad idea .
I understand the desire to get more money into the hands of people that will circulate it in the economy .
However , a tax cut that means less money in the SS funds is hardly a wise move .
In fact , what we need to do , is immediately restore the tax structure we had under Clinton .
Then add another 5 % for those making over 1 million a year .
Cap the FICA taxes at $ 500,000 , and make is on all income .
Then start to rebuild our grid , to make it both a truly national grid , and to make it less vulneable to natural and manmade disasters .
Pay for it the same way we have paid for the Interstate Highway System .
Water systems in this nation are not only in major jeopardy for many our our metropolitan areas , but many of the existings systems lose nearly as much water as they deliver .
Water is one of the key three things needed for survival , we are already seeing the some cities reusing sewage water .
Time to go to work on that , also .
Kill the F-35 weopons systems , only spend as much on defense as the next 7 nations combined , and the infrastructure improvement become doable .
we 've had the payroll tax "@ holiday @" for a year now and it has not helped the economy in any significant way @....
another leftie failure to fix @....
when is the left going to agree to a pro @-@ growth tax structure to bring jobs back @..@ ?
taxing the rich is n't going to cut it @...

BO just stole from Peter to pay Paul @.....

Actually Obamacare , pushed by the democrats and obama himself , cuts half a trillion from medicare over the next 9 years ( the study will say ten years but a year has passed already
) <a href="http://www.cms.gov/ActuarialStudies/Downloads/2010TRAlternativeScenario.pdf"> http://www.cms.gov/ActuarialStudies/...veScenario.pdf </a>
Agreed .
In fact , one of my disappointments is that he has not been liberal enough !
Specifically , a larger stimulus was needed and a public option should not have been taken off the table .
He had no choice and he did n't give a fuck .
What makes me laugh is that you guys ( and by '@ you guys @' I mean all those who have n't worked the truth out yet ) @....
is that you keep falling for the bullshit .
heh heh cute .
But please , run along .
The adults are trying to have a conversation .
Really ?
Where ?
Cuz all I can see is a bunch of whiny assed children .
Christ some of you members have ZERO sense of humor .
Lighten up
I have a sense of humor .
I laugh at your stupidity quite often .
And somehow I am not offended
Good .
The truth should never offend .
my shovel was ready !
There 's a job going in DC for those who shovels .
There 's a lot of bullshit that needs removing .
You do n't go after banks corporations too much in a bad recession .
I have n't seen any plausible ways suggested to get them to stop hoarding .
Any public option would have lost us blue dogs and the whole ACA .
COULD N'T get anymore .
I believe he could have seized the major banks and nationalized them .
Then forced them to lend the money given them by Bush , and also force them to rewrite loans .
That certainly would have helped get the country going again and was being called for by some of the more far left liberals .
I did n't mean to suggest a Public Option would have made it all the way through , but Obama dropped it quicker than he dropped smoking .
That never made sense to me .
And to what extent ?
I think Obama has undeniably accomplished a lot in his first 3 years , but his over @-@ reliance on diplomacy with Republicans has impeded critical progress .
I 'm sure the cons / repubs on here are undoubtedly going to answer this question too , but at least try and be mature about it @...
*@ plays flute to summon the small band of lefties out of the woodwork @*
"@ diplomacy with the Republicans @" ?
you gotta be fucking on something @..
My biggest disappointment with Obama is that , in negotiations , he tends to give too much to the GOP in hopes that they 'll be fair and willing partners in governance .
I realize that he 's trying to appeal to the middle , but at some point he 's got to say enough is enough ( which he SEEMS to be doing now - we 'll see ) .
If he did n't already know it , he should know by now that the GOP is not the least bit interested in compromise .
I agree .
You got it .
That 's the only issue I had .
His willingness to compromise did n't fly because of their '@ make him a one term president @' agenda .
He then should have came out guns blazing .
You are on something , another planet .
how many Republicans should he have killed doyathink ?
Three .
Mitch McConnell .
Paul Ryan .
Eric Cantor .
Any other moronic questions ?
Are you as disappointed as I am with the violent rhetoric from the left ?
You mean like Obamacare ?
Give some examples of this .
It just shows how looney left you are .
Obama is the most divisive bitterly partisan President in my lifetime , and that 's up against some pretty stiff competition .
Really ?
How old are you ?
I 'd have to say Nixon was the most divisive one I 've ever lived through .
Do you have some examples of how bitterly divisive Obama has been ?
Actually , the fact that you think Obama , who is quite conservative in his governance as Democrats go , is some kind of extreme left @-@ wing ideologue , shows how looney right YOU are .
Nice diversion .
Try answering the question .
I agree .
Either Kaz thinks George W. Bush is a centrist , or Kaz is a child .
I wonder which it is .
I 'm a socialist .
He is a liar .
By backing down on the Public Option .
You talk like he could have passed a public option Bill .
He did n't have the votes from his own party for that .
He had to bribe to get the Bill passed that he has .
Obama should have invoked the 14 th Amendment during the made @-@ up debt crisis created by the Teapubs .
He should have kept the Public Option on the table too .
The Dems need to stop compromising when it 's clear the other side has no intention of doing so .
He 'd better not compromise and give in to the pipeline if the Repubs attach it to the payroll tax cuts .
I 've been pretty pleased with Obama on the whole but if he caves on that one too , damn I 'm gonna be pissed .
Yeah !
it would be a fucking shame to put 20 thousand Americans to work and to find a source that is n't Arab @..
we got it .
we fucking got it .
asswipe .
In this case , you mean Canada 's got it .
Yeah , it would be a shame to spend all that time and money investing in a filthy , polluting energy source instead of spending time and money on cleaner , cheaper alternatives .
Funny how the House Repubs are fired up all of sudden about jobs when they have n't given a shit about jobs since they took the majority .
Nice fairy tale , yours ?
I absolutely agree with you on the 14 th Amendment .
Of course , the TPers claim Obama took total control of all medical care in the country , so I 'm sure it does n't take much imagination to know what they would claim if he had gone the 14 th Amendment route .
Still , would have been nice to see .
I see him compromising on the pipeline just like he did with the tax cuts for the wealthy .
The GOP has proven they will destroy families in order to get what they want .
Obama really has no choice .
They sure have .
Reid declared the bill DOA anyway so hopefully he will n't give Obama a chance to cave .
If the payroll tax goes back up 2 % to it 's original amount , it would suck but it would n't be the end of the world to me .
Let the GOP Obstructionists play their game .
If it 's going to hit them in their wallets , they 'll eventually scramble and draw up a clean bill .
So you support the continued fleecing and bankrupting of SS .
The cut has been ineffective . , But as long as you get some welfare its good right ?
Ineffective ?
First off , I thought conservatives believed any and all tax cuts are good .
They always create jobs , always .
Second , we 've had private sector job growth every month since the cut was in place .
What world do you live in ?
There 's a switch , huh ?
A conservative in favor of letting taxes increase @....
to fund SS no less .
You thought ?
Damn , I missed it .
My bad .
What you already said @...
is the biggest reason for me .
He and his admin .
have also shown they 're not much better than the Repubs when it comes to the big banks .
Yes , and what I find so bizarre about it is that Repubs are constantly trying to paint him as this liberal extremist .
I mean that charge is just so patently false .
trillions of the stimulus was given to banks overseas !!!
yeah lets give em trillions more !!
libbs are idiots !!
heh heh you think the stimulus was trillions ?
I think you have some reading to do .
I think he 's got a few years of grammar school to make up first .
What makes you think that a US President has the right to seize banks and nationalize them ?
The reason that the US has always attracted foreign investment is that we are a nation of laws in which the owners of private companies are protected from arbitrary "@ seizures @" of their assets by the government .
Do you not grasp that this is what makes us different than so many other places in the world ?
As for "@ forcing @" banks to make loans ?
Have you so quickly forgotten that doing THAT was what got us into trouble with the housing bubble that just burst ?
It used to be that banks looked for 20 % down on a house and one had to PROVE credit worthiness .
That all changed when government intervened in the process and forced banks to make loans to people that did n't qualify under previous standards .
"@ Forcing @" banks into making bad loans was bad policy before and it remains so now .
That 's the really frightening part !
That they think that way .
They are nothing but a bunch of communists trying to "@ fundamentally change America @"
My biggest disappointment is that he seems to think he is above politics .
He thinks he can stay out of the infighting and come in at the last minute and resolve everything .
He has an idealistic view that if he is reasonable , the other side will be reasonable too .
The result is that he is the only person in the room compromising
The result was an unfocused Stimulus bill trying to please everyone .
He gave up the Government Option on healthcare .
He extended the Bush tax cuts and offered spending cuts without corresponding revenue increases
On the bright side , it seems he has learned his lesson and realizes the other side is not playing by the same rules
Yet another liberal circle jerk
Yeah , that 's how we got Obamacare rammed down our throats .
That 's not what 's rammed down your throat though , is it rw ?
Labeling it this way or that is n't going to hinder their attempts at preventing it next time .
And how would you prevent , apart from banning people from the Service based on Religion which is ludacrous in regard to the spirit of our Country @......
and being a good human being in general .
That is n't at all true .
Nidal Hasan was well KNOWN to be a nutcase .
He was n't hiding it .
People noticed that he was SAYING more and more radical things .
Because he was muslim , everyone was too afraid to say anything for fear they would be identified as being somehow anti muslim .
We should never be afraid to be intimidated by religion to say that a muslim is a dangerous lunatic .
Ok several things going on in thios post @:

It 's not "@ Pc crap @" that 's at fault , it 's your supreme lack of common sense and analytical thinking skills that are at fault .

You guys have fun though .
Usually , when people say "@ pc crap , @" what they 're referring to is "@ having respect for people . @"

If it makes you sleep better , I 'm all for it .
Seriously , I 'm genuinely astonished that anyone can agree with the official , carpet sweeping description of what happened at Ft. Hood .

Thanks so much for reinforcing what I wrote .

There is an AUTOMATIC inequality in income .
It is already unfair to the person who only walks off with $ 80.00 for a day 's work .

Sales tax is an equal treatment tax @....
progressive income tax is not @...
and that , whether you like it or not , is truth
For the same reason , Sales tax is not equal treatment .
The ore you earn , the more you spend , the more sales tax youy pay copmpared to someone who earns less and thus spends less .
Yes .
IMHO , the progressive tax scale is fair .
The problem is n't taxes , it spending .
We need to force Congress to balance the budget .
So you think people should be treated differently based on the money they make rather than being treated equal before the law @...
How is that at all consistant with the idea that all men are created equal ?
Everyone is treated the same under a progressive system .
We both get taxed the same on our 10,000 th dollar earned , we get taxed the same amount of our 100,000 dollar earned and we get taxed the same on our 1,000,000 dollar earned .
Seems equal to me .
Actually , that 's not true .
The tax code is full of deliberate carve outs and byzantine rules which lead to unintended results .
We do not get taxed the same based on income .
Even the rules of what constitutes income are complicated .
Our current tax code is the product of some social engineering , some legitimate means to fund the government , and a whole bunch of corruption in the process .
That has to be the ultimate in demagoguery .
The idea that you can tax someone 's income without taxing him is about as idiotic as you can get .
It 's hard to believe libturds have the nerve to spew such idiocies into a public forum
True .
Our system is not as simple and ideal as I may have made it sound .
There are plenty of loopholes , breaks and ways around the system that make it unfair .
We need to clean up those loopholes and correct the system so the richest in our country can n't continue to get richer and richer while the middle class get poorer and poorer .
Here comes the concrete thinker .
I would be surprised that someone can n't grasp what I meant , but it 's you , so @........
LOL .
It went completely over your head .
I 'll give this one more try @....
Our system taxes dollars in that @...
it does n't care who earns the money , but if anyone earns x dollars , they are paying a certain percentage .
If you earn more one year , and less the next year , the amount you pay will change because the rate is attached to the dollars , not the person .
If the rate was attached to the person , you could earn a million dollars this year , pay X percentage of taxes and next year lets say you lose your job , go broke and make nothing , you would still be paying the same amount because the rate is attached to you , not the dollars .
That 's not how our system is , thankfully .
All you 're saying is that an income tax is not a capitation tax .
No duh ?
Thanks for providing no useful information to the discussion .
You still have n't explained why it 's just for one person to pay a higher rate on his income than another .
I could conceive of a tax that was graduated according to the amount of melanin in your skin .
You might claim it discriminates against black people , but using your logic I would just say that it does n't tax black people , but the melanin in your skin .
Of course taxes come out of someones pocket , that 's not at all what I was referring to .
Whether you agree with this or not , I hope this makes sense now , but I 'm not holding my breath .
It only makes sense to people who have had a lobotomy .
I grasp exactly what you meant , that 's why I said it was idiotic .
There are no taxes that people do n't pay .
They all come out of someone 's pocket .
You said our system "@ taxes dollars , not people . @"
What part did n't I understand ?
Yet the left does n't talk about taxing the dollar .
They talk about taxing those evil , greedy , rich , 1 % bastards who are stealing wealth from the average American paying their "@ fair share @" .
You know , the 1 % who pay 43 % of federal taxes while 47 % of the remaining 99 % pay nothing .
Actually they do @...
the plans call for taxing incomes of over 1 million dollars , not specific people .
The legislation never says we want to tax , Bill Gates or Ruport Murdoch , etc. , specifically .
I 'm glad you understand now .
I expected you to insult me once you finally understood what I mean , so thanks for that .
I tried to discuss with you before about why a flat tax would hurt the lowest earners but you ignored my question .
Did you not understand that one either ?
I really can n't hold your hand through every post here .
At some point , you 're going to have to figure these things out on your own .
I agree on the clean up but I disagree on your reason .
The tax code ought to be used to properly fund government operations as determined by the voters in this country , not to regulate income .
You do n't like being insulted , but you never fail to use that condescending tone whenever you disagree with someone .
That 's why I seldom treat leftists with respect @: they are all such colossal hypocrites .
WE were discussing how it 's just for one person to pay a higher rate on his income than another , not whether a flat tax hurts low wage earners .
However , one consideration you continually ignore is that every flat tax proposal exempts income up to a certain point .
Normally that point is well above the poverty line , so none of that actual flat tax proposals would hurt low wage earners .
That would still not be paying any additional tax .
Tax shelters are a thing of the past .
Tax deductions for children help everyone · Write off of mortgage interest help the less wealthy afford homes @....
and are invariably offset by the real estate taxes they have to pay · Tax deferred investments are income that are ultimately taxed .
I am curious what loopholes exist that you are referring to .
The major one I was referring to is capital gains and the fact that its taxed at a lower rate than income .
Only at the personal level , not the corporate level .
Capital gains plus corporate income tax is actually quite high .
That 's not true .
The rate is attached to the activity , not the dollar .
Hence GE paid zero in corporate taxes but I paid taxes in years where I lost money .
That 's the problem with using the tax code to execute social engineering .
It underfunds the government and does nothing to help those worst off .
But that is not a loophole @...
it is a separate tax altogether and is really a tax on "@ unearned @" income in theory @..........
and it is available to anyone @...
whether they are incested in one share of IBM or a million shares of Microsoft .
It 's a loophole in that many of the wealthy derive their income in this manner , it 's why Warren Buffet is able to have a lower overall tax rate than his secretary .
Buffett pays a lower rate than his secretary because he can afford to manipulate his income .
If you removed the "@ loophole @" as you call it he would just use some other means to accomplish the same end .
Also , it 's not necessarily bad that he pays a 17 % rate on his personal income .
If that rate doubled would he continue the same economic activity ?
Would the government receive more funding as a result ?
The Alternative Minimum Tax started out as a "@ millionaires tax . @"
How has that worked out ?
Your buddy DiamondDave would n't have any exemption at all , even for people at or below poverty .
It was he who I was talking to originally , when you decided to butt in .
Yep I think people should be taxed based on their income level .
Who ever says taxes need to conform with the ideals of equality ?
I think men should be paid more based on having a dick .
See how that works ?
Well at least you 're not claiming that everyone is equal in that department .
So that means if you have a dick you pay more in taxes too .
asterism has explained it very well but I would add @...
People still seem to think this is about INCOME tax .
Its not .
Never has been .
Ultimate loophole of all time is that WEALTH is taxed at a much lower rate than income .
Ultra @-@ wealthy hide wealth and therefore pay no tax on it .
GET IT ?
I think you may not get it .
Wealth is not taxed at all .
Wealth is the net after taxes
Income is taxed .
The ultra wealthy do n't hide wealth .
They may hide income , and that is against the law @......
, but they do not gain anything if they hide wealth as one is not taxed on wealth .
And if I said I wanted to tax aerospace companies in Washington state that gross over $ 10 billion a year , that would n't be the same thing as creating a tax on Boeing Aerospace , would it ?
Not if Boeing opts to make pencil erasers instead @....
or have a bad year and gross less than 10 billion a year .
I believe THAT is the point RDD is making .
The tax would n't be on Boeing @...
it would be on any company that fits the criteria .
Do n't be stupid .
Of course it 's a tax on Beoing .
A federal court ruled exactly that when the state of Washington tried to impose exactly such a tax .
That 's like saying I do n't have to pay income tax if I want to starve in some cave .
That has to be one of the most idiotic arguments ever posted on this board .
NOT IF BOEING OPTS TO CHANGE THEIR BUSINESS MODEL and no longer be in the aerospace industry .
Regarding the proposed million dollar earner tax · A million dollar earner is taxed as a million dollar earner ONLY when he has an income of a million dollars or more .
The following year he makes only 900 K ?
He ios no longer being taxed as one earning a million bucks .
Now @...
I agree with your senmtiments about a tax on those earning a million bucks or more @...
But I can n't figure out why you can n't see the point RDD and I are making .
He does n't get it , he will n't ever get it .
Apparently it 's too tough of a concept .
You 're the one who does n't get it .
The fact that you use some criteria to identify people to tax other than identifying them by name does n't mean you are n't discriminating against them by name .
I already posted you an example that proves my point .
You 're mad , are n't you ?
So , the left wants to redistribute wealth with taxation and that is n't an attempt to legislate some equality in wealth , right ?
Not mad at all .
You 're just wrong .
No one wants to make us "@ all the same @" .
That 's just your typical brainwashed bullshit that I hear all the time from the right .
You ask ANY progressive on here that same question and I doubt you 'd even get a positive response from ONE of them .
No one said the rich can n't be so .
That 's just Rush Beckbaugh talking to your ignorant ass .
And that 's always the lefts excuse for denying what they really are .
Believe it or night most people on the right do n't get weekly marching orders from Beck or Limbaugh .
Do you see me accusing you of being a Michael Moore or Paul Krugman parrott ?
The left wants equal outcomes .
How do I know that ?
Look at the policies they push for .
Giving more and more to the poor and taking more and more from the rich .
Are you really trying to deny that ?
How can such policies result in anything but an equally mediocre society ?
Freedom and safety are opposites where government is concerned .
The more you you gain of one the more you lose of the other and the simple fact is liberals value security more than freedom .
We can all strive for risk free lives , but keep in mind that is going to curtail the ability of anyone person to succeed much beyond another and believe it or not there are benefits to members of society defining and achieving measures of success as defined by themselves rather than government .
3 % that was cut in the beginning of the Bush Presidency was paid for by loans from China .
Asking the Rich to return to that sustainable level is hardly asking for more and more is it ?
Tax policy should not be fair .
No one can agree on the definition of '@ fair @' .
The government should just tax those who can n't do anything about it .
That would be anyone with an addiction ( booze , gambling , sex , tobacco , reality TV audiences @...
etc. ) and all left handed people named '@ Doug @' .
Why do you hate left handed people ? !
You Righty !
Giving more and more for the poor and taking more and more from the rich .
No .

but you see an ever growing homeless situation happening ?

Finally @...
the left 's excuse for "@ denying what they are @" ?

that 's more of your brainwashed propaganda against the vast majority of our population @...
you know @...
the people who do the wealthy 's dirty work and get shit on at every turn ?
wow @...
an entire post of talking points .
They got ya hooked .
You are aware that "@ wealth @" as opposed to income has already been taxed when it WAS income , correct ?
The US can not operate a nice welfare / warfare state state with that attitude !!!!!!!!
I disagree .
Taxes can be entirely fair by assessing the same user fee to everybody who uses a service or product or government program .
If we go the income route , a tax can be entirely fair by assessing the same proportional percentage to ALL income regardless of socioeconomic standing .
The only way taxes will be '@ fair @' is when they are not used to control , discipline , or manipulate people and / or the economy .
Taxes should be collected to run the NECESSARY functions of government and for nothing else .
You even want MORE of the same @...
You applaud every time the jobs go overseas @....
You applaud the gross tax evasion that those same entities are allowed to commit because "@ they are just trying to keep what is theirs @" .

Really ?
Care to back up your "@ vast number @" ?
From where I sit , the vast number of people are n't holed up in some shanty eating shoe leather .
I 'm in a city with over a million people in the greater metro area .
The Occupy folks are camped out a block from my downtown office .
The most I 've ever seen at one time is about a dozen people .
You 'd think that if the "@ vast number @" are as poor off as you would have us believe , they 'd be swelling the ranks of the folks championing them , but they are n't .
Why ?
They are at work putting a roof over their family 's head and living life .
Look , you want to talk about fucked up , propaganda and indoctrination , you need to can that class warfare bullshit like , "@ the people who do the wealthy 's dirty work and get shit on at every turn @" if YOU want to be taken seriously .
Not some criteria @....
Income .
Nothing more , nothing less .
Does it really matter whether you name them by individual name or simply by demographic ?

and before you even start @...
there are a hell of a lot of people out there that will never be anything more than a menial labor kind of worker .
Your problem is @...
you seem to think that they do n't deserve a decent life in this country because they may not have the brains to get educated or the business savvy to run their own .
You are an elitist who only cares about the elite .
and the only reason you are so infatuated with such a SMALL number of employees ( unionized ) is that the idiots on the radio tell you to be .
You have not a fucking clue @...
not one .
oh I know @...
next you 'll be telling me how you either worked with , or was a Union member at one time and they were all jackoffs @...
that 's just message board fodder because no one can prove it @...
so I do n't believe it .
It does n't matter whether it 's income or the color of their skin , it 's still discrimination .
What if the government placed a tax on people who could n't speak English ?
All you leftist turds would be howling about that , would n't you ?
Yet , to avoid it , all you have to do is learn English .
How is that any different in nature than a graduated income tax ?
Because thats basing a tax on something arbitrary .
What I 'm talking about is basing tax solely on dollars earned .
Holy fuck you 're an idiot .
Serious question , whats the highest level of education you completed ?
And what do you do for a living ?
I hear a lot these days about asking people and companies to pay their “@ fair share @” in taxes .
While I ’m not sure what a “@ fair share @” is ( it seems that everyone believes they are paying a “@ fair share @” or more of their own income already ) , I wonder if that should be the deciding factor .
Should tax policy be “@ fair , @” or should it focus more on what is best for the country ?
We have a determinable tax base from which to draw these revenues , so let ’s assume that expected revenue , without difficult to support GDP changes based upon certain plans , remains the same .
How would you divide the taxpaying “@ pie @” between the various income levels ?
We could conclude that it was the most beneficial to reduce the levels paid by the lower income levels , in order to spur consumption .
Lower income households would tend to immediately spend those additional dollars on things they either want or need .
Of course , since many of the products that are purchased by this group are made in China , it may not spur our economy to the extent you would think , and it would most certainly reduce the country ’s saving rate and dollars available for investment , but there is a case to be made that it would increase economic activity , at least in the short term .
If instead you reduce the levels paid by the upper income levels , those additional dollars will likely not be immediately spent , but invested in ( hopefully ) some productive endeavor .
Again , some ( probably fairly sizeable ) percentage of those funds would also find their way to China as investments in plant or equipment , or in purchases of business assets .
However , the savings rate of the country and the total pool of private capital would increase , theoretically spurring business investment .
Setting aside what is “@ fair @” , which do you think provides the best chance for long-term growth and prosperity ?
Is there an optimum level where consumers have enough to spend and the pool of capital is adequate ?
Government has no business being anything other than Impartial .
Either it establishes and serves Justice or it is at war with Justice .
Can n't have it both ways .
LOL .
Yeah you 're tearing my argument to pieces .
A fellow conservative even tried to explain this to you and asked why you can n't grasp this .
Not every conservative has a firm grasp on every issue .
Conservatives in this forum post all kinds of stuff that is just plain wrong .
That 's because they were all educated by communist indoctrinators .
They mistakenly believe some of the swill they were spoon @-@ fed in government schools .
I ask about your schooling and job because I need to know if I 'm actually dealing with someone who has the capability enough to use his brain to hold a job or achieve some sort of degree .
I have serious doubts at this point .
No , you 're simply a leftwing jackass who is losing the argument .
You have n't really thought about the stuff you believe in , so it 's easy for someone who has to tear you apart .
You are n't fooling anyone by attacking my schooling or my mental capabilities .
Anyone with a brain can see who is losing this exchange .
I did n't attack your education or job .
I just inquired about it .
Learn the difference @...
oh thats right , you can n't .
I 'm going to cut my losses and learn that talking to you is like explaining things to someone with severe autism and a severe delusions .
I 'm sorry you 're embarrassed by your lack of education and job .
It does explain a lot about you though .
The Constitution seems to say it should .
BTW , your avatar just cracks me up .
Really nails Ron Paul .
He tries to be the real thing but he 's a fake .
And , his darling little boy proves that the crumbs do n't fall far from the fruitcake .
I 'd give a lot for a real Libertarian to run but Paul and his nasty little plutocrat son ai n't it .
I knew Dave Nolan back in the 70 s .
I had worked with Dick Lamm who was registered Dem but who was really a closet Libertarian .
I 'm afraid real Libertarians are long gone now .
Nah , you 're wrong about Dr. Paul .
You can insult me all you want .
Like i give a shit .
lol !
But you do n't know anything about Ron Paul .
He 's an educated & experienced physician who also served his nation honorably in our Military .
What have you ever done for this country ?
You just sound like another spoiled Entitlement brat .
You and Wall Street .
So why are you so angry with them ?
You really are n't any different .
You are on the same team .
First I was n't insulting you .
Anyone who would post THAT avatar does n't think much of Ron Paul and I was insulting him and his posing as a Libertarian .
Second , you do n't have a friggin clue about "@ entitlements @" v. Wall Street .
Did you even think this through before you said those two are the same or even related ?
Entitlements are earned by real people who work for many years for real companies .
The Wall Street mess was caused by just the opposite .
Why do n't you know that ?
do you have parents who get Social Security ?
Talk to them .
If you were a Libertarian , you would be very angry with Wall Street .
Now I see that you 're just a kid who thinks a president with a light saber would be cool or some such silliness .
Well , good luck with that and be sure to vote for Paul .
I bet you get told you 're not a very good listener all the time huh ?
Read and comprehend .
Try it .
Who knows , you may even like it .
I am very angry with Wall Street for always demanding their handouts from Taxpayers .
But I 'm also angry with many of you in the OWS Movement who do the same thing .
You both have an Entitlement attitude .
I think you both need to stop demanding handouts .
We 're broke for God 's sake .
Enough is enough .
Why do some of you keep saying that Wall Street fat cats are the same as the working class who pay into their entitlements and then want to draw on them when they retire ?
What makes you think Wall Street is "@ stealing @" from fellow citizens ?
Jeez .
You just make it up as you go along , do n't you .
I 'm not "@ IN @" the OWS movement .
I 've never demanded or gotten a handout .
I 've worked for everything I have , I 'm comfortable and no , you can n't have it to give to the 1 % .
And , if you think "@ we 're broke @" , you have n't been paying attention .
Educate yourself and stop thinking that Ron Paul is going to save you .
Then why are they protesting ?
They can still do that .
That has n't changed .
They just want their Taxpayer Freebies just like Wall Street does .
It is '@ Generation Gimme .
' But we just can n't afford them .
No it 's just that people like you can n't be honest .
It is all about demanding those Taxpayer Freebies .
Does n't matter to me you will n't admit that .
But it is reality .
Take a closer look at their signs and listen to what OWS is really saying .
It is all about the Entitlements .
They have their hands out and so does Wall Street .
And they 're not even occupying the right places anyway .
They should be in Washington because that 's where all the real problems are .
OWS and Wall Street are just in competition with each other for their handouts .
They stand for the same basic Entitlement philosophy .
Question .
You truly believe that the people who have lost their entire LIFE in this economic meltdown by @-@ way of foreclosure , as a direct result of the real sense of ENTITLEMENT and irresponsibility of investors , are in fact similarly motivated ?
I think there is a broader view of holding people accountable that your conveniently ignore with your argument .
AIG gets bailed out , then gives multi @-@ million dollar bonuses in the very same year .
That 's entitlement .
Average American has his house foreclosed on by the very banks he is paying to bail out , and wants answers and recompense .
Entitlement or accountability and justice ?
Common sense tells us that bankers that have to sell their third vacation home are the one 's with entitlement issues .
Not the people that want them to pay their share of the tax burden which they very much are responsible for .
Why did they lose their entire life ?
And why is that other Taxpayers @' fault .
You do n't get to demand stealing from fellow Citizens just because your life did n't turn out the way you wanted .
That 's the same exact mentality Wall Street has .
If your problem is with the Banks , then sue the banks and try to get some money out of them .
I have no problem with that .
But your real problem is still with Washington .
They gave Wall Street all that Taxpayer cash .
You guys are occupying the wrong places .
Get to Washington .
But do n't demand your fellow Citizens pay for your own mistakes or problems with Banks .
We 're broke .
The Entitlement Gravy Train is off the tracks and out of gravy .
So to clarify , bankers / investors / lobbyist take knowingly absurd risks and engage in frivolous and unwarranted spending with money people have entrusted them as their futures ( home , retirement , college , etc. ) .
Then , the bubble bursts and we have to assign accountability .
Ready , go @...
The lawmakers choice to bail out the banks is an entirely separate issue of accountability .
That legislation was headed by Republicans under the Bush administration but was very partisan in nature , however measures of spending accountability were absolutely mishandled .
But again totally different argument .
Responsibility for the event lies with @...@ ?
Well see , there 's your own Entitlement attitude slipping out .
Just sounds like you 're blaming everyone else for your own mistakes .
That 's just way too common in the OWS Movement .
I 'm not defending Big Banks that got Taxpayer Bailouts but Citizens have to be held accountable too .
They played a big part in the economic collapse .
Bad decisions and greed is what got a whole lot of Citizens in trouble too .
But anyway , if you want to blame Wall Street for all your problems then go for it .
Sue them and try to get some money out of them .
But do n't demand fellow Citizens / Taxpayers pay for your mistakes .
The Gravy Train really is all out of gravy .
For some reason you remind me of Dennis Leary ( Video has a few F-bombs if your at work )
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAVoQfoU0dQ"> STFU - Dennis Leary - YouTube </a>
Yea it does seem that most in the OWS Movement want to blame everyone but themselves for their own mistakes .
That 's why i can no longer support them .
They had it right in the beginning when it was about being angry at Wall Street .
I could get behind that .
But then it became all about the Entitlement attitude .
'@ Generation Gimme @' stepped in and hijacked the Movement .
Now i just see them as Entitlement Whiners .
And i think most Americans are now seeing them that way too .
Anyway , thanks for the hilarious vid .
It is classic .
It 's all about the Taxpayer @-@ funded Freebies in the end for both Wall Street and OWS .
They want to steal from fellow Taxpayers to better themselves .
They 're demanding their handouts .
What do we do now with this Self @-@ Entitlement Monster ?
The Well 's run dry . We 're broke .
Thats why I liked them at first too @...
but when the cries for a "@ guaranteed middle class job out of college @" and "@ I should n't have to pay off my loans @" amongst others started being more prevelant than anything else I became disgusted by them .
If the tea party stopped being about fiscal conservatism and the debt and transformed into a conservative social issues movement I would feel the same sense of disgust toward it .
Yea i think good honest people were there at the start of the Movement .
But they were quickly booted and replaced with '@ Generation Gimme @' whiners .
And I 'm sure George Soros had a hand in hijacking the Movement too .
It is sad but that 's where it stands currently .
I can no longer support them .
Uncle Ferd says its kinda like buyin @' a car from a used car lot - it ai n't as good as it looks @...
Half of Unemployment Rate Decline Due to People Giving Up Job Search , Labor Data Show · December 2 , 2011 – Half of the 0.4 percent decline in the nation ’s unemployment rate is due to people giving up hope of finding a job and leaving the labor force altogether in November , government data and CNSNews.com calculations show .
In the month of November , 315,000 people left the labor force altogether , the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) reported on Friday .
The unemployment rate , reported today , has declined by 0.4 percent – from 9.0 in October to 8.6 percent in November .
However , had those 315,000 people not left the labor force , the unemployment rate would have been 8.8 percent – 0.2 percent higher than the officially @-@ reported 8.6 percent rate for November .
The unemployment rate went down for two reasons @: the economy created 120,000 jobs and 315,000 people left the labor force in November .
If those who had left the labor force are added back into it and added to the ranks of the unemployed – because they do not have jobs – the small decline in the unemployment rate is cut in half – to 0.2 percent .
In October , the size of the labor force was 154 million people and 13.9 million were unemployed .
In November , the labor force was 153.9 million people and 13.3 million were unemployed .
Other BLS data show the true jobless nature of the current economy .
Despite the 120,000 jobs added in November , the overall population grew by 172,000 , meaning that there are not enough jobs being created to keep up with population growth .
Those 172,000 people went right into the ranks of those who are not in the labor force at all , a figure which rose to 86.6 million in November , up 487,000 during the month .
Secondly , the number of those who “@ want a job now , @” according to the BLS , rose 192,000 in November , going from 6.4 to 6.55 million people in November .

So we 've heard 2 years worth of Obama whining like his OWS peasants , Him mostly whining about a "@ do nothing Congress @" and the "@ GOP obstruction @" stopping him from doing anything .
Now unemployment is down to 8.6 % .
And libtards are dropping to their knees to PRAISE HIM !!!!
Why ?
CEO 's approved this hiring .
Corporations funded it .
Barack Hussein Obama has been hampered by a "@ do nothing Congress @" and "@ GOP obstructionists @" @......
right ?
So when shit goes bad , Obama is immune from blame , because a do @-@ nothing Congress and the GOP are preventing Him from dong anything .
But when things go well , He gets immediate credit , despite the fact that all that new hiring is being done by the very CEO 's and corporations He and his ilk spew verbal venom at every chance they get .
Thanks to all the CEO 's and corporations for taking the chance to go ahead and hire .
We know , with Obama in office the future is very unknown and shaky , but you guys hired anyway .
Keep up the good work .
And Mr. President @...
try not to fuck it up .
Of course , you can n't @'@ t do much with a do @-@ nothing Congress , so not sure why you got credit for it anyway .
CEO 's were hiring @--
"@ I 'm saying it bluntly , that this administration is the greatest wet blanket to business , progress and job creation in my lifetime .
A lot of people do n't want to say that .
They 'll say , '@ Oh God , do n't be attacking Obama .
' Well , this is Obama 's deal , and it 's Obama that 's responsible for this fear in America . @"
"@ The guy [ Obama ] keeps making speeches about redistribution , and maybe '@ we ought to do something to businesses that do n't invest or hold too much money .
' We have n't heard that kind of talk except from pure socialists . @"
"@ Business is being hammered .
The business community in this country is frightened to death of the weird political philosophy of the president of the United States .
Until he 's gone , everybody 's going to be sitting on their thumbs . @"
Steve Wynn @--@ DEMOCRAT @--@ CEO

I can n't blame a corporation for not hiring .
Of course progressives believe its a companies job to hire because money grows on trees @...
If I was a CEO i 'd piss out my office window @...
hahahaha
"@ look its raining over me but not over anyone else thats weird Karl Marx must have been resurrected -@ ts a sign from Marx "
Well Steve Wynn @--@ a DEMOCRAT home boy @--@ and CEO says screw Obama they are n't @' going to hire until Obama is GONE .
I do n't know how much clearer than you can be than that ?
If I was in charge of hiring I would do whats in my companies best interests @...
Hiring redundant workers would n't be one of my priorities @..
I 'm sure democrats expect companies to hire for no reason @...
If they do n't they 're rich snobs @...
Democrats see companies the same way they see government @: An entity that exists solely to support a person without holding that person any way accountable or expecting anything in return .
It 's Microsoft 's moral responsibility to hire , pay and care for hordes of left wingers .
Pay them just to @...
well , show up and blog and drink coffee .
This is what I 've been trying to say all day .
Despite how much the dems have warned that cutting govt would derail the recovery - govt continues to shed jobs and yet the private sector continues to pick up .
This is a slap in the fact for big govt dems who cry out at even the littlest cut to govt.
Which CEOs , specially , do we thank ?
Wow
A right @-@ winger admitting unemployment is actually down .
I guess Obama only gets credit when unemployment goes up
I think it is a safe and secure answer to the question ; "@ Why are you a liberal ? @"
Because I do n't want to be associated with Bucs90 .
Start with the one that pays you .
Because , unless you are a government employee , a CEO is in charge of you being employed and paid .
That "@ CEO @" might be Mom or Pop and their community grocery store .
It might be the CEO of Boeing or WalMart .
It might be the CEO who owns wealthy , but local , food chains , like Charleston 's Sticky Fingers , or the South 's Chic Fil A .
But if you work , and you are n't a gov't employee , then somewhere out there is a person who enables your continued employment .
Not saying we must kiss anyones ass .
Not saying we "@ owe @" them anything .
They ask for a job to be done , we ask for payment .
So long as both keep doing their part , the deal is going .
So , I thank the CEO who decided to keep my position funded , and the manager who hired me .
We are supposed to thank the President everyday @....
because he makes all this possible .
There has got to be a way that we can all hook up to a service like "@ Go To Meeting @" annonymously next November 6 th .
I would pay a fair sum to be able to see the looks on the faces of these crazy people .
Well it would be a change from the foul abuse he 's had so far , but if Obama walked on water , a hypocrite like YOU would report "@ OBAMA CAN N'T SWIM @"
You are a drone compared to President Obama @.....
a true American
Actually , there 's nothing to thank CEO 's or Obama for in these numbers .
You drill down into them , they are pretty awful .
First , the economy only produced 120,000 jobs in November .
150,000 is considered baseline growth .
The reason the number dropped was that the "@ Household Survey @" only counts those who are employed or looking for work , not those who have given up because unemployment benefits have run out or they find they can get buy without working .
375,000 people dropped out of the workforce altogether .
Also , most of these jobs that were created were low paying ones .
Hospitality and retail jobs that were created for the holiday rush .
A lot of these jobs will be eliminated when demand goes down after the holidays .
Looming on the horizon , the Euro @-@ Crash and state and local governments having to slash payrolls to meet budget shortfalls .
Private sector payrolls were up 140,000 .
But as has been happening month after month ,
government payrolls were down .
Down 20,000 last month .
The size of government has been shrinking dramatically @...
just as conservatives claim they want and just as conservatives claim is good for jobs and the economy .
So why are n't you happy ?
Instead of trying to blame Obama for tepid job growth @...
The tepid growth is because of policy dufus .
So how many threads do we need to show how really , really stupid we can be ??
If anyone actually thinks the employment market is better , why do n't you go see how many of your neighbors have recently found a job .
Well other than part time , seasonal work which will n't even qualify them for UE benefits .
8.6 % unemployment is an accomplishment ?
It is !!
democrats are celebrating the manipulation of numbers .
“@ I helped Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp develop supply side economics .
I helped lead the effort to defeat communism in the Congress . @”

Do you even pay attention to current events ?
Or is Fox News your only source of information ?
Are you just in denial ?
Does it make it easier for you to dislike him by deluding yourself into thinking he 's done nothing at all ?
Here is a partial list @:
- The stimulus has created millions of jobs in the PRIVATE SECTOR .
Even in light of this recent information , repubs still say it was a waste .
Not true .
- The unemployment rate dropped from 12 % to 8 % .
( Yes , it 's now at 9 % , but obviously we are better off than we could have been ) .
- Obama has made good on most of his campaign promises ( as reported by PolitiFact ) .
- He has killed / captured 5 X as many Al @-@ Queda terrorists in his first 3 years than Bush did in all his 8 year presidency .
( Do n't believe me ?
Look it up .
In fact , I first learned of this fact on Fox News of all sources ) .
Much has changed in America since Barack Obama was sworn into office as the 44 th president of the United States on January 20 , 2009 .
In less than 1,000 days as chief executive of the U.S. , President Obama 's failed policies and initiatives have resulted in a dizzying array of dismal economic statistics .
As it stands now , Obama appears headed toward an economic legacy that may very well surpass Jimmy Carter in its level of failure .
We have seen under this president an expanding number of citizens who are partially or wholly dependent on the government for their very livelihood , as the data show that the U.S. has become an ever @-@ growing welfare state under Obama .
Government dependence , which is defined as the percentage of persons receiving one or more federal benefit payments , is at a staggering 47 % , its highest level in American history , while 21 million households are reliant on food stamps .
In fact , government spending on food stamps in 2010 ( $ 68 billion ) was double what it was in 2007 , with the 2011 figure likely to be even higher .
According to the August employment report from the Department of Labor , the nation 's unemployment rate remained at 9.1 % with a total of zero jobs added to the economy during the month .
Among demographic groups , Latinos had an unemployment rate of 11.3 % , while African @-@ Americans posted a rate of 16.7 % .
For blacks , that represents the highest unemployment rate for this group since 1984 and a rate more than double that of whites ( 8 % ) .
When Obama took office in January 2009 , the nation 's unemployment rate stood at 7.8 % , a rate higher than the historic norm , yet far below the current rate , and above any rate during the Bush administration .
Since June 2009 , six months into Obama 's term , the nation 's unemployment rate has been at or above 9 % during 25 of 27 consecutive months .
Those are the official unemployment rates .
The real unemployment rate , as it is sometimes referred to , rose to a seasonally adjusted 16.2 % in August .
That rate , as defined by the U.S. Department of Labor ,

He got our credit downgraded
He racked up deficits bigger than any Reagan budget
Are you just in denial ?
Ya @....
No other president has ever accomplished getting our credit rating downgraded even once , and this one may even get it downgraded TWICE !
Wow !
What a man !
False @....
I think it not only saved millions of jobs it actually created hundreds of millions if not close to 3 billion jobs @....
Why is it that every time a lefty posts numbers as to what the Stimulus did the numbers get better and better in Obama 's favor .
The unemployment numbers suck after three years so do n't even go there .
And Obama did n't kill one single terrorist .
The military did .
-@ there is always churn in the jobs market , even during the depression , I assume you will provide proof that these jobs hes crated in the private sector are @- net jobs ?
Because labor participation rates and the forgotten unemployed do n't seem to do it for me @....
-@ not all promises are equal , are they ?
and those ones he did n't deliver on ?
- hummm , so killing T 's etc. is a good thing now ?
I see .
US adds 103,000 new jobs but unemployment rate unchanged
Great news is n't it ?
But wait there 's more
The increase in employment partially reflected the return to payrolls of about 45,000 Verizon telecoms workers who had been on strike in August .
The number of unemployed people , at 14 million , remained essentially unchanged in September .
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/oct/07/us-new-jobs-unemployment-rate"> US adds 103,000 new jobs as unemployment rate unchanged | Business | guardian.co.uk </a>
So there were n't 103,000 jobs added to the economy .
Someone is cooking the numbers .
I wonder who ?
Reach Much ?
We were promised Unemployment would never go above 8 % if we passed the Stimulus .
If you think 250,000 Plus per "@ Job @" Created was a good thing , then by all means it was a stunning success .
Unemployment was never 12 % , and was lower than it has been under Obama , under Bush .
Made good on his Campaign Promises which ones ?
Closing Gitmo ?
Uniting the World ?
Not Letting Unemployment go above 8 % ?
Being Transparent ?
Being Bipartisan ?
WTF are you talking about ?
Your Claim that he has killed 3 times as Many Al Qeada is completely False .
We killed Thousands under Bush .
Besides Obama is continuing Bush Polices that He ( Ran Against ) in order to kill those Terrorists .
Osama would still be alive if not for Programs Bush Started that Obama called wrong , and Illegal , and then Continued .
You are about as clueless as they come dude .
Obama has been a Massive and Utter Failure .
Worst Leadership I have ever seen from any president ever .
The Current Debt Crisis illustrates his Lack of Leadership For all to see .
He thinks he can just come up with a Number and order Congress to figure out how to reach it .
He does not have the balls to put his own Numbers on the Table , and suggest how they pay for it .
Because he is n't a leader , he is a perpetual Campaigner and chief .
I am wrong about the unemployment rate , but every other point I made about Obama is true .
You can claim it 's false all you want , but facts are facts .
That is the denial that I referred to .
Thank you for demonstrating my point .
When I have more time ( tomorrow ) , I will provide the sources for all of this information .
But really , if you were actually informed on current events , I would n't have to .

It 's your opinion .

Your side uses the excuse for the high number as " it would have been far worse @" @....
You nor anyone else does not know that .
There are no facts to support any of the numbers of "@ saved jobs @" @..
The only number that matters is the official unemployment number which is 9 % @...
A number which the Obama admin attempts to pass off as " the new normal @" @..
Spin .
This is such hypocrisy .
IN one instance your side states that businesses are not hiring .
They are sitting on over a trillion dollars in cash .
On the other hand your side states that MILLIONS of private sector jobs have been created @...
SO which is it ?
Which is the LIE ?
Obama has killed ?
Ummm , not quite .
For that matter , NO WAY .
Obama is coat tailing the operations set up by the previous admin .
The peopel serving in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve ALL of the credit .
Obama gets NONE .
So cut the bullshit .
No politician conservative or liberal gets the credit for military successes .
The fighting men and women get the credit because THEY did it .
You spew here what you claim to be facts .
In the absence of proof using links with facts , your post is opinion .
That 's that .
Obama 's policies are the most anti -@ business anti freedom and anti capitalist of ANY presidential admin in recent memory @...
Except those of Jimmy Carter .
Now get to work and provide those links .
And be very careful from where you get your information .
It will be scrutinized .
We ask questions .
And question answers .
If you are an Obama sycophant , just be a stand up guy / gal and admit it .
This would save everyone a lot of time .
"@ You must spread some rep around etc. @"
You 're giving Obama credit for that ?
Do you watch Fox News ?
I am .
And yet there are fewer jobs now than there were when he took office .
And yet to make this happen , the Feds have reduced the jobs available number by about 2.5 million and that is why the unemployment rate has dropped .
Without that change in the formula , the UE Rate is still above 12 % .
Close Gitmo , fix the worst economy since the Great Depression , Out of Iraq , out of Afghanistan , open and transparent government , end of crony capitalism , bi @-@ partisan cooperation and honesty .
0 for whatever in most of what he promised .
I suppose this beats trying them in courts .
Eliminates the need to read rights if the suspects is lying around in several pieces .
The legal and humane way to arrest suspects .
Everyone but Foxbots realize he got a lot done before Pubs started blocking everything 2 / 2010 @- now assume the position @...
Care to list what he did that was beneficial ?
Sure you can but let 's really give obama credit for helping Americas enemy in Libya .
Al qudea
Obama has done more than that .
And , he was an incredible state senator and US Senator .
Republicans can n't get passed the black .
You get them calling Obama "@ man @-@ child @" at 50 years old ( code for boy ) and "@ magic negro @" and so on .
The list is endless .
They constantly try a lame attempt that Bush was made fun of so it 's OK if they do it too .
When you point out that Bush , at one time , was the most popular president in history , they make up even more lame excuses that Democrats were "@ afraid @" of not supporting him .
OK , then they did support him .
Which was it , they did or did n't .
The Republican Party is 90 % white , old and based in the Confederate South .
They are acting the way conservatives have for over a hundred years .
It 's who they are .
They just hate Obama .
Many of the things they say are so fantastic , they would never say those things about anyone else .
Anti Christ ?
Really ?
I guess it 's just different @...
somehow @...
when leftists do it .
Dave are you shocked that two idiots agreeing about obama ?
Then he certainly deserves credit for what 's happening now .
Where 's your links for all of these "@ accomplishments ?
I believe that is the procedure here .
it does n't matter how many times you say it , the stimulus failed .
the economy is worse than ever .
obama accomplished nothing , nothing good anyway ,
he DID manage to take a bad situation and make it WORSE
i knew that card was gonna get played by SOMEONE @....
Care to list what he did that was beneficial ?
Key word .
Good grief , why ?
Never .
They do n't want to hear about that or what 's happening in Egypt .
Is this what obama supported in Egypt ?
Torture
So you are claiming 3 Hugely Unpopular Pieces of Legislation as Victory ?
Ramming through Health Care , Stimulus , and Dodd / Frank against the will of the people is all you have to hold on to ?
Sucks to be you .
Republicans were given the power to Block Obama 's Agenda after only 2 years for a reason .
People do n't like Obama 's Agenda .
Idiot .

This has been going on for decades .
Charts and graphs @....
anyone can create those .
Especially one which owes it 's existence to the present presidential administration .

Please .
Look Chrissie , at the end of the day , the economy is crawling along at about 1.7 % annual growth .
The US has had it 's credit rating lowered TWICE .
Spending is at historic highs with this admin spending more than all others combined .
Unemployment is still at 9 % plus .
Our Southern border is still a pipeline for illegal immigration and drug trafficking .
Gitmo is STILL open .
We 're having to endure news stories of our troops being killed by roadside bombs in Afghanistan .
We still have a president that has NO energy policy other than to kowtow to environmental lobbyists .
The housing market is still being manipulated by a meddling and intrusive federal government .
We still have a federal government that goes around suing states for trying to do within the law what the White House will not regarding illegal immigration .
We have a federal government acting in deference to unions and union activists , attempting to stop a major aircraft firm from doing business where it sees fit @....
You can post all the charts and graphs you wish .
It does n't matter .
Until Capitol Hill and Pennsylvania Ave gets out of the way of Main Street , nothing will change .
Good Grief Chris , pull your head out of those dark places and read some facts .
Your posts are ridiculous .
That 's not my post .
Gettin worried , are n't ya ?
You should be .

It figures .
"@ national liberal @" @..
The CBO @...
Now there 's two entities that have zero interest in keeping Obama in the White House .
Politifact is a liberal blog .
ah the this cite is bias and the CBO does n't jive with my opinion right now so i will n't use it .
Here 's the problem , you walking obscenity , it is NOT opinion .
It 's fact .
There is no possible way the CBO 's or any of the various blogs cited numbers here can work .
The federal government 's own unemployment figures and the current condition of the housing and other consumer markets belie any published numbers handed out by the Left , the White House or CBO .
So go ahead and process that for a while .
I for one would be thrilled to see unemployment lowered , more people making money .
That increases economic activity which stimulates business activity which translates to prosperity .
The current presidential administration will not let that happen .
I think my favorite question for President Obama was , "@ Who is you favorite White Sox player ? @"
Not because of the question , but because of the answer .
"@ I , uh @...

um @...

you know @...

has been missing in action through this whole thing .

you know , like the ones he CLAIMS he wants to close @...
only this one is so magnanimous that he thinks we will n't call it what it is .
See , it 's a TAX BREAK to companies and corporations that hire vets .
Take THAT occupy wall street !
Ai n't that wonderful of the man ?
Set up a system to fail so that it cuts the defense budget in half , puts thousands of soldiers in harm 's way without the equipment they need and then give corporations tax breaks to hire them when they come back in wheel chairs and on crutches .
Wonderful man ai n't he ?
This is EXACTLY what Obummer and the democrats WANTED to happen with that stupid super committee crap in exchange for raising the debt ceiling in the first place .
If you doubt it , just look at the ideologues they put on the thing .
The only mistake the republicans made was in voting to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for anything short of repealing Obamacare and passing the Ryan budget that actually would have cut 4 TRILLION out of the budget .
This president and the democrat party has not only not passed , but has not even OFFERED A BUDGET since Obama took office @...
little on offered some grand deficit reduction scheme .
Something that I might add has NEVER HAPPENED before in the history of this country and they damn well could have done since they controlled BOTH HOUSES of Congress for the first 2 years Obama has been in office .
900 @+ days with out a budget and in contempt of the Constitution .
By the way , the TRUTH of the super committee negotiations is that the democrats did n't off ONE SINGLE PLAN .
The republicans offered several and the last one that the democrats rejected out of hand actually included closing the tax loop holds you mistakenly seem to think the democrats want .
However , as I said , they rejected it out of hand .
They really only want to SAY they want to close the loop holes .
They do n't want to get caught actually doing it by their corporate masters and fat cat donors !
What put the troops in "@ harm 's way @" was invading Iraq for oil @..
and nation building in Afghanistan .
Done right @..
there would have been no or little loss of life and the whole war on terror would have been over in several weeks @..
with Osama Bin Laden dead and buried .
Instead what we got was a big fucking mess .
Thanks to bozos like Bush and Rumsfeld .
True .
Wow , you Republicans are really into denial .
Okay here it is .
Proof !
Obama @:
"@ The Budget Control Act that I signed into law last month will cut annual Government spending by about $ 1 trillion over the next 10 years .
It also charges the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction with finding an additional $ 1.5 trillion in savings .
As part of this jobs bill , I am asking the Congress to increase that amount so that it covers the full cost of the American Jobs Act .
In addition , I believe that the Congress should seize the opportunity that this new Committee presents and do much more so that we can put the country on a sustainable fiscal path , which is critical for our long-term economic growth and competitiveness .
For this reason , I am sending to the Congress this detailed plan to pay for this jobs bill and realize more than $ 3 trillion in net deficit reduction over the next 10 years .
Combined with the approximately $ 1 trillion in savings from the first part of the Budget Control Act , this would generate more than $ 4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade .
This would bring the Nation to the point where current spending is no longer adding to our debt and where our debt is no longer increasing as a share of our economy @--@ an important milestone on the way to restoring fiscal discipline and moving us toward balance . @"
[ Living Within Our Means and Investing in the Future @: The President 's Plan for Economic Growth and Deficit Reduction , WhiteHouse.gov , September 2011 ]
There you go .
Can n't argue with facts .
However , it should be noted that many democrats did n't support the bill either .
I never said democrats should n't be to blame for impeding Obama .
Contrary to what Fox News will tell you , Obama is on the center of the political spectrum .
He has been criticized by Democrats for being too diplomatic .
In other words , do n't blame Obama .
Blame ALL of congress .
parroting a bunch of comments on the the White House website is not '@ proof @' of anything other than it was '@ promised @' .
Do you have the actual bill he proposed , showing the savings mentioned above ?
I did not "@ parrot @" a bunch of comments together .
That is an exact quote taken directly from whitehouse.gov .
Come on , is it really that hard to believe ?
It 's right there in front of you .
I did not say '@ parrot a bunch of comments together @' , implying you 'd mixed a bunch of stuff together @...
you read my comment incorrectly .
I said .
parroting something from the White House website does n't count as proof that Obama ever actually submitted what the comments promised .
I want a link to the bill , House or Senate , that Obama introduced , which '@ would @' be considered proof .
Is that so hard for you to understand ?
What exactly would stop Obama from sending it to the Congress ?
He did n't say he was in the process of making the bill .
The bill was already finalized .
He sent the bill and it was rejected .
I guess will look for the proof that he sent the bill to congress , but I do n't understand why you need that level of proof .
Where do I even look for something like that ?
Okay , here is the next best thing .
An outside news article confirming it .
It 's amazing how easy it is to find this stuff with a simple google search .
You should try it sometime .
<a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-04-13/politics/obama.deficits_1_spending-cuts-deficit-reduction-tax-hikes?_s=PM:POLITICS"> Obama seeks $ 4 trillion in cuts ; GOP assails call for tax hikes - CNN </a>
Same ole same ole , the obummer just says something and these clowns eat it up without question .
No scrutiny needed , the messiah said it , it 's true .
There you go , believing the liar in chief and calling it proof .
And billy goes wa wa wa all the way home .
still tore up the deal .
Why ?
Because it included taxing the wealthy .
It 's absolutely ridiculous .
Fox News / Republicans are always touting that taxing the wealthy would n't make a big dent in the deficit , which is true .
However , just because it 's a small dent , it does n't mean that it should n't be included in the proposal .
The tax hikes on the rich that Obama proposed would have reduced the deficit by 300 billion dollars .
As small as that amount is toward reducing the deficit , is n't it a good compromise on the issue of taxes considering that the proposal totalled 4 trillion all together in cuts ?
Can the rich really not handle being slightly less rich than they could be for the sake of getting the country back on track ?
Now , all we have to show for it is 1.2 trillion in automatic cuts .
You are liar .
BUT YOU THINK A CUT TEN YEARS OUT IS A CUT PROVING YOUR STUPIDITY .
It 's a cut over 10 years .
You obviously do n't know how these things work @....
" The Budget Control Act that I signed into law last month will cut annual Government spending by about $ 1 trillion over the next 10 years .
As part of this jobs bill ( LIE ONE .
It was the "@ The Budget Control Act @" but he tried to claim it was a jobs bill when in fact it was a deal to INCREASE THE DEBT CEILING .
Just more political posturing with no real intent ) , I am asking the Congress to increase that amount so that it covers the full cost of the American Jobs Act .
( BULL SHIT call number 2 . He and the demwhits negotiated a deal to INCREASE THE DEBT CEILING and before the ink on it had dried , reneged on the deal and attempted to tie it to his "@ Stimulus II @" wish list which would add another 1.6 TRILLION dollars to the deficit NOW ! ) In addition @...
( on and on he drones with no intent of acting . )
There you go .
Can n't argue with facts @....
First , let me address this "@ Budget Control Act @" crap .
The ONLY fact in that is that he signed the bill @...
UNDER PROTEST I might add .
Just WHEN was that little bit of legislation signed into law ?
Oh yeah , 2011 !
This law WAS the bill passed in exchange for raising the debt ceiling .
Obama had to be dragged kicking and screaming to accept even this TINY little bit of fiscal reform in order to avoid the US defaulting on its debt .
So that is BULL SHIT !
As to the rest of that lunatic ranting and political positioning on whitehouse.gov , There WAS NO BILL INTRODUCED EVER !
Why @...
because democrats did n't want to get attached to a stand alone piece of legislation that raised taxes on ANYONE while adding 1.6 TRILLION dollars in deficit spending .
They , just like anyone who actually understands this stuff and the mood of America KNOW that 70 % of Americans do NOT favor tax hikes or increased deficits .
Just about as many did NOT favor extending unemployment benefits .
AND nearly 80 % do n't believe there will be ANY benefit from the "@ American Jobs Act @" or "@ Stimulus II @" after his moronic , "@ @...
shovel ready were n't so shovel ready @" slip of the tongue .
Next , the bill he signed had to be passed by a REPUBLICAN House to even GET to Obummer 's desk .
So to portray republicans as obstructionist is disingenuous to say the least and a flat out LIE in the fact of it !
He and the democrats got damn near everything they wanted and they STILL reneged on it before the ink was dry .
This thing has gone just EXACTLY as the democrats hoped .
However , they have misunderestimated the American people once again .
"@ We the People @" ai n't buying the crap he 's shoveling .
And when 2012 rolls around @...
THAT will be made clear !
Oh , nearly forgot to mention .
If you actually DO read the links Conservative posted , you will find that the republican controlled House of Representatives has passed some 22 pieces of budget and deficit reduction legislation in the last year and a half and NOT ONE has been brought to the floor of the US Senate by Dirty Harry .
Just WHO is the obstructionist ?
You are really tap @-@ dancing around this issue .
The entire point I am trying to make was that Obama did in fact introduce legislation while you claimed ( and apparently are still claiming ) never happened .
Are you just ignoring the CNN link I posted ?
Also , what you think about the democrats and Obama is irrelevant .
Mostly because I am not defending the democrats in congress .
And you are wrong about Americans @' attitudes towards tax hikes .
Most Americans agree that there should be tax hikes on the WEALTHY , which has been Obama 's position since the beginning .
This radical , one @-@ sided believe you have toward politics is laughable .
To put all of the blame on Obama / democrats for America 's troubles shows that you really do not know much about these American issues .
Is Fox News all you watch ?
That is sad .
Great quote .
I think it speaks volumes coming from an independent rather than a democrat sounding like a broken record .
The president 's "@ offer @" included $ 500 billion in new spending .
That 's a non @-@ starter .
No Republican is going to vote to give the president another slush fund to pay off union supporters with , especially since a portion of that money will end up in Democrat campaign coffers in the form of union dues .
Also , as always , his proposal consisted of tax increases immediately and all the cuts back loaded over a 10 year period .
In other words , the "@ cuts @" were purely imaginary .
Do you turds actually believe no one is wise to your scams ?
Exactly .
I can n't believe that any wingnuts would have the balls to bring up anything to do with "@ putting troops in harms way @" after their support of the Iraq invasion and occupation .
I have and do support going into Afghanistan after Bin Laden however and so did Bush at first .
But then later he said "@ I do n't know where bin Laden is .
I have no idea and really do n't care .
It 's not that important .
It 's not our priority . @"
Sure you did , and I 'm the Queen of England .
Getting the country on track would be removing obama from office .
That is all .
like Libya ?
Can you post this "@ torn @-@ up bill @" for us to see ?
Obummer .
I really am fascinated by all these whimsical nicknames thrown out by individuals such as this .
I really should catalogue them , just so I can provide at a moment 's notice a reference to all the '@ sage @' things they come up with .
I notice it just as much on these forums as I do anywhere else on the internet .
It 's in the DNA .
Childish name calling appeals to children .
actions by some of the protestors ?
What Fox News / Republicans do n't seem to understand is that the bigger a movement gets , the more trouble @-@ makers it is going to attract .
In other words , the trouble @-@ makers at the OWS protests do not represent the movement itself .
The OWS from the very beginning had a message of peaceful protesting .
That is what the founders of the movement intended .
Unfortunately , because the movement is leaderless and has become so wide @-@ spread , some of them have gotten chaotic .
That is a human @-@ driven consequence ; it is not because of the ideology .
I think it is reasonable to criticize the OWS movement as lacking clear goals and leadership .
If it did have these qualities , I think more people would take their message more seriously .
However , by that same rationale , it is unfair to criticize the movement itself for a few of the trouble @-@ makers .
Let me put it this way @: if the Tea Party had become as popular movement as the OWS has ( not even close ) , would the movement have attracted the same kind of law @-@ breakers we see at these OWS protests ?
The answer is absolutely .
the tea party elected representatives , have a Congressional caucus and impacted the legislative process so much it prevented the dem agenda
ows has only broken laws
Stop making sense .
The right @-@ wing neocon whackjobs on this board only care about the small percentage that seemingly cause trouble .
They love Wall St 's unfettered love of greed and capitalism .
Accountability is something that happens in a CPA 's office , not on Wall St. Do n't you know that Wall St is responsible for creating all those jobs out there .
Even when they create nothing , but just take massive fees for doing nothing , or , in the case of some CEO 's get their '@ rightful @' hands on those multi @-@ million dollar bonuses even if the stock tanks and the company makes a loss .
You know why ?
Because most of them are like John Gotti - only in the sense they should have the moniker Teflon in front of their names - because nothing is ever their fault and nothing ever sticks .
Stock tanked ?
"@ Not my fault that the economy 's going under .
Did n't @' see that coming .
You want me to involve my lawyers if you do n't pay me my bonus ?
Think of the bad publicity .
NOT MY FAULT @"
That 's how they think .
And the biggest irony here is , that all these neocon loons on this board that support them harp on about personal responsibility ALL the time - except when it comes to Wall St apparently .
'Cause it seems that because they create "@ all these jobs @" , they are somehow entitled to a free pass .
And yet , polls show that most Americans do not support Tea Party ideas .
In fact , more people support the message of the OWS movement than they do the message of the Tea Party .
What upsets most Americans about the OWS movement is the crime and over @-@ night occupation .
The OWS message itself , however , is something they support .
You are doing exactly what you criticize others for .
You do n't want OWS labeled for the actions of the few @....
and yet that is exactly what you do .
Hypocrisy is funny though .
what message is that ?
Really ?
WHo have I criticised ?
That we have a financial system that favors the wealthy .
yes we do
that is the message ?
every financial system in history favors the one with the finances
a financial system that favors the poor = charity
You are a few days late and a few dollars short .
A few tea party people had some signs at their rallies · that some did n't care for.so what happened ?
the whole tea party · was branded as racist and according to Chris Mathews , all white .
You are gonna have to live with it my friend .
How bout that guy they let out of jail that threatened to · burn down NYC and firebomb Macy 's @...
Have n't seen any OWS peeps denounce this guy .
the Odoriferous Wasteoid Slacker movement is nothing but a nuiscence @....
to claim it has any credibility with anyone other than Marxists and other assorted crazies is fucking delusional .
It is n't even covered by news outlets for the most part .
LOL , you all SURE DID N'T have any trouble labeling the WHOLE Tea party FOR A FEW @..
Do n't like it when it when the shoe is on the OTHER FOOT eh ?
Only thing , I have n't seen anything nobel about the OWS @...
rambling bunch of idiots in my book .
Not only that , they consistently LIED about the tea party when they could n't find enough whack jobs to make them look bad enough .
So I am sure you all heard of his speech in which he said if Republicans did n't pass his Bill Murder and Rapes would go up .
In that speech he claimed the Murder Rate in Flint Michigan had more than Doubled already .
False it is down 11 % .
He pointed out that Flint had , had to lay off some cops , which is true , but he left out the most important fact .
Flint was in Negotiations with the Police UNION , they wanted them to take a small Cut in their benefit Program in order to Avoid any lay Offs .
As Unions usually do , they chose keeping their Benefits at the level they are , over keeping Cops on the Job , and the Lay offs happened .
However despite the layoffs Murder and Rape are still down 11 % in Flint .
Is this to be SOP for the Democrat Party for now on ?
Propose a Whole Shit load of spending , then Claim opposition to that new spending is "@ cutting Jobs @" and causing people to be raped and Murdered ?
Democrats should be ashamed of this Administration and their Hyper Partisan , Dishonest , Fear Mongering .
Less cops - more murder and rapes .
Why is that so hard to understand ?
Rapists across the country are tuning in to CSPAN @- just hoping that the Obama Jobs bills does n't pass @.....
Could be .
Could be .

A bad economy and fewer jobs WILL almost certainly cause more crime and strife .
Fox Poop .
Link ?
And Yet Violent Crime is Down Substantially right now in the middle of a Bad Economy .
Go Figure .
Why did Biden try to panic Americans by saying that rape statistics would rise if Obama 's jobs bill was n't passed ?
Is he a fool who is n't aware that violent rape incidents are going down or is he a lying bastard who does n't give a damn ?
He is a Democrat Desperate for 4 More years .
Joe Biden Lied through his teeth and claimed Rape was up 100 % in Flint when it 's down 11 %
Flint laid off Police officers because the Union Refused to accept any Cuts and chose their Benefits over avoiding Layoffs .
Would n't Feculant Flea Beggers be a better Description ?
Think it 's going to stay that way with less police ?
Heck @..
maybe there are less police to report crimes to so people are like , why bother ?
And why should cops have to accept less benefits ?
So they can cut taxes for overpaid rich folks ?
In a word , YES .
Greed is bribing corrupt politicians for favorable tax treatment .
Ask Warren Buffett @:
"@ '@ Through the tax code , there has been class warfare waged , and my class has won , @' Buffett said .
It ’s been a rout .
You have seen a period where American workers generally have gone no place , and where the really super rich as a group increased their incomes five for one in this rarified atmosphere .
<a href="http://prospect.org/article/why-we-need-occupy-wall-street?utm_source=Daily+Digest&utm_campaign=39ed4689d6-DD_11_16_1111_16_2011&utm_medium=email"> Why We Need Occupy Wall Street </a>
Great , so unions bribing corrupt politicians is bad , right ?
Union membership in the overall workforce has declined from about 35 % in the 1950 s to around 7 % today .
During that same half @-@ century , the 1 % has tripled their share of income and wealth .
It seems like the 1 % are getting a lot more benefit from their corruption dollars than unions are ; prosecuting corruption in unions and on Wall Street is n't likely to happen by "@ choosing @" between Democrat OR Republican in the voting booth .
Yup the "@ rich @" get richer .
The solution is not to make the rich poorer , but to make more people rich .
Government can n't do that .
Only getting an education , having a good idea and working your ass off can make you rich .
Conservatives do n't hate poor people .
We hate that there are poor people .
Paying people to stay poor only makes more poor people and less rich ones .
I share your POV , Geroge , but I think you 're more hopeful than I am .
I 've kinda seen these popular protests come and go , ya know ?
I mean , compared to the antiwar and civil rights movements OWS seems like ( at least so far ) small potatoes .
But the fact that the OWS movement has changed the nature of the grand national argument Americans are having ?
Now THAT has been it 's major success to date .
And THAT is a good thing , in my opinion .
Do you remember reading what Noam Chomsky has had to say about the early days of the protests against the Vietnam War ?
As I recall , he 's said the number of spectators outnumbered the marchers , and the police spent their time protecting the protestors from spectators .
OWS has projected a timeline for success that 's roughly equal to the amount of time between the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the ratification of the Constitution .
OWS will have to become ONY .
IMHO , they will have to bring hundreds of thousands of unemployed and underemployed onto Wall Street , possibly on week @-@ ends , in order to maximize crowd size .
A few years ago , I saw first hand the effect that half-a-million protestors in the streets around LA City Hall had on local government .
That was during the height of "@ Immigration Reform @" when Spanish language radio was instrumental in convincing Hispanics to get involved on their day off .
If OWS can do the same thing in Brooklyn around next November @...@ ?
Any millionaire who wants to pay higher taxes can just stop taking deductions .
Easy , or they can write a check .
Solution found .
I do n't know where you were during the immigration reform grand march .
I was here .
It accomplished nothing except to deprive mexicans of a day 's income .
It was so harmful that they never did it again .
Is n't that a clue ?
There were plenty of stores open with the hispanic ones closed .
Schools reported less fighting , freeway traffic was a breeze , stores reported less shoplifting , hospital emergency rooms could treat truly sick and injured people .
Meanwhile , the changes that they wanted , never happened .
There is no universal amnesty , they still do n't have driver 's licenses .
They got nothing .
The goal was to shut the city down .
All they did was shut themselves down .
So hard , that it was the first and last time they did it .
Although I wish they would do it again .
It was so nice .
One day of experiencing what it would be like without the inconvenience and annoyance .
Schools reported less fighting on a Saturday ?
In fact "@ they @" did it again the following May Day with a march along Wilshire Blvd. · Where you there ?
Do you have any clues about how to organize marches of that size in support of Wall Street ?
Any "@ inconvenience and annoyance @" experienced by local bigots was a small price to pay for sending the 1 % the message that immigrants will n't be scapegoats this time .
The OWS movement rails about "@ greed @" , like we can outlaw an emotion .
But what is greed ?
Is someone who works hard because he wants to get ahead greedy ?
I do n't think anyone would say so .
It seems greed is wanting money that legitimately does n't belong to you .
I can be as greedy as I want , but unless someone gives me money voluntarily then it does n't do much .
If I deceive someone , then I am a criminal .
But if I deliver on what I 've promised then I 've earned my money .
By that definition the OWS crowd are the greedy ones .
They demand their student loans get paid off , yet they 've done nothing to deserve that .
They demand @--@ well , I do n't know what they want .
Neither do they .
But demanding someone else 's money is greed .
Greed is Wall Street destroying the world economy with a $ 516 trillion dollar derivatives Ponzi scheme .
Greed is one of the Seven Deadly Sins of the Bible @:
1909 painting The Worship of Mammon by Evelyn De Morgan . Greed ( Latin , avaritia ) , also known as avarice or covetousness , is , like lust and gluttony , a sin of excess .
However , greed ( as seen by the church ) is applied to a very excessive or rapacious desire and pursuit of wealth , status , and power .
St. Thomas Aquinas wrote that greed was "@ a sin against God , just as all mortal sins , in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things . @"
In Dante 's Purgatory , the penitents were bound and laid face down on the ground for having concentrated too much on earthly thoughts .
"@ Avarice @" is more of a blanket term that can describe many other examples of greedy behavior .
These include disloyalty , deliberate betrayal , or treason , [ citation needed ] especially for personal gain , for example through bribery .
Scavenging [ citation needed ] and hoarding of materials or objects , theft and robbery , especially by means of violence , trickery , or manipulation of authority are all actions that may be inspired by greed .
Such misdeeds can include simony , where one profits from soliciting goods within the actual confines of a church .
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins"> Seven deadly sins - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia </a>
If we want to stamp out lust we can start with Congress .
But this is n't about the 7 Deadlies .
It is about the definitin of greed .
How do you separate greed from ambition ?
Greed can mean an excessive desire for getting or having something , especially money , but greed is not always a bad thing .
Greedy people can be , by virtue of their own ambitions , very benevolent and are often charitable people who also employ many others and sign their paychecks .
There will always be greed , however one defines that , and there will always be people who benefit from greedy people .
Greed can be a very good thing .
It can mean JOBS .
What you are describing is ambition , not greed .
I maintain greed is wanting what does n't belong to you rightfully .
By that definition the OWS people are greedy .
Your vision will likely not change things .
Many people think poverty is a virtue .
It may or may not be , but expecting someone else to work to support you does n't seem particularly virtuous to me .

You and others like you have proven beyond all doubt that it is a waste of time to reply to liberal rants .
The liberals are running ( and ruining ) this country .
Liberalism is a fucking mental disorder !
Well played !
How obedient the lemmings are !
Yeah @....
right .
The left just wants the gov't .
to tell you what to do .
Funny how the left hates the truth .
I would like to thank you for being a complete moron and showing everyone what the left is really all about .
If we could only learn from our mistakes !
Let 's review @: · 2001 a federal budget surplus .
Then tax cuts for the rich , two wars fought on credit borrowed from the Chinese .
Then deregulation of the banking system and Wall Street .
gee .
I wonder which policies really screwed the pooch ?
Maybe we should run right back to the Conservative policies that squandered the surplus , reduced revenues by cutting taxes for those who are most comfortable and borrow from our economic competition to pay for wars we should never have fought in the first place .
Or we could poke sharp sticks in our eyes .
Either way makes as much sense as the other .
My thoughtmasters are telling me to call you a fuckin @' idiot .
Sorry , they made me do it .
More left wing bull crap .
There was no surplus , Clinton played with the numbers and Newt balanced the budget .
You would n't know the truth if it mattered to you .
Your grandchildren must be very proud of your filthy mouth .
I 'm pissed off at your fucking White House giving 1.4 BILLION $$$$$ to a 1 % bastard like Robert Kennedy Jr. to bail out his "@ green @" company .
Now if you want to start "@ Occupy the White House Elites who perform Financial Fellatio on a daily basis with Rich Donors @" , I could get behind that .
There was no surplus .
I assume you are referring to the imaginary surplus created by the voodoo economics of the Slick Willy administration .
Try again .
The rest of your post is opinion .
I remember during the campaigns of 2000 they , the press , was calling the recession at that time the "@ Clinton recession @" .
How many times are you going to post the same tripe pretending like it 's factual ?
You purport to know what OWS is all about .
Guess what , there is no concise belief system of OWS .
There are so many divergent point of views , there is no way to actually begin to discuss the '@ movement @' in an intelligent , logical manner .
You can re @-@ post all the points of legitimate contention over and over .
However , when the vast majority of the movement has been an uncivilized assault on the rest of society peppered with vapid chants , you 're not going to convince anyone that it has any more substance than a teenager 's temper tantrum .
Crony capitalism has been on the fore front of political debate for at least a few years now .
And it got there without any of the vitriol of the OWS .
At this point in time , the OWS has not only changed absolutely nothing or put forward any new objections or ideas , they have actually made a mockery of some very legitimate greivances .
More often than not OWS protestors are targeting their peers on the street rather than anyone who has committed any actual wrong doing .
You call that an intelligent movement ?
Castigating working people for trying to make a living ?
That 's not only misdirected , it 's compelely stupid and counter productive .
And you wonder why no one takes anything about the so called movement seriously ?
By all means , wake up .
Now here 's a decent post worth reading .
While the OWSers are entitled to make their point about income inequality and greed , the manner in which they 're doing it does not serve the cause very well .
Well unlike the ignorant azzhole with the Detroit Lions avatar , you at least make some points - even though you do exactly what the OP says - which is ignore all the points that the 2 nd Phase of OWS is forwarding .
So here is the difference between us @: I can acknowledge your points .
Yes , there are a lot of in OWS we would all rather not have there .
But as far as making grievances in the way that you feel it should be done ?
Well what 's that gotten you ?
Cronyism disappear from politics , did it ?
Less influence of corporations , SIGs and unions on elections ?
How about that Citizen 's United decision , eh !
Oh yeah , THAT helped .
Now I never lived in a tent but I 'm glad these people did .
They started a wake up call .
It has evolved way beyond the tents now .
Oh , and I started another thread that simply let people know that what they were seeing on the MSM about OWS , was no more comprehensive that what was shown about the Tea Party at first .
Offered some of the issues .
What were the replies from Conservs ?
Not ONE said "@ Well let 's discuss this issue about @....@ @"
Just a bunch of parrots repeating what the MSM has fed them .
Like 1984 @...
This thing has just grown thousands of times bigger and gotten a lot more attention .
Growing pains of an movement that is still in it 's embryonic phases .
We are NOT going away .
But they will n't address the issues .
The ThoughtMasters have told them · not to @...
And the MSM has been doing this for years and years .
The Right has ONE , count them ONE media outlet and the f'ing 10 @+ left wing media masters can n't stand it .
You do realize this has been going on for years and years on your ( cough , cough ) news sites .
They lost all journalistic integrity by filling everyone with lies and left wing BS and you have the nerve to b*tch about the ONE right leaning cable news network .
ROTFLMBO !!!
1 st Post from Consrv .
Zero issues of OP Addressed .
Not like that 's surprising .
2 nd Post from Consrv .
Although from a complete frikkin @' moron like Wiseacre , not sure anyone would EVER expect issues to be addressed .
No shit .
This guy 's a complete tool that daily regurgitates re @-@ hashed left wing talking points @....
and then goes on atear about others being "@ brainwashed @" .
3 rd Post from Consrv .
Of course Soggy is as stupid as Wisacre and I doubt either have ever actually discussed an issue .
I 'd love to debate either of them on actual issues !
But you know , they do n't to facts , issues , etc. @..

Not like that 's surprising @...
These guys are SO predictible .
All whackjobs .
See signature below if you want to know how ANY of them will react to facts , evidence , issues etc. @..
Yet another Post from Consrv .
Okay , point made .
Conservatives are scared little cowards when it comes to issues .
They 're scared sh1tless !
20 post , not one has the balls to discuss a single issue .
Their ThoughtMasters have forbidden it !
So the mindless drones just parrot what they are told to think .
What a bunch a weak little pusses .
You lack both independence and logic .
And you wonder why people do n't address the '@ issues @' you raise .
Issues are based on at least some vague reality - left wing whining does not count as reality .
Mmmk ?
ID 10 T
anyone who 's stupid enough to believe that the status quo ante citizens was that the electoral power resided in the *@ people 's @* hands is stupid enough to believe that OWS has accomplished something beyond 15 minutes of fame .
LOL !
ANOTHER One , Cali ?
Okay Sweetie , you 're absolutely right !
There is no such thing as Gramm @-@ Leach @-@ Blilely , Bailouts or the Double Irish .
Now go play and we grown ups will talk about what of course , would n't be reality to a child .
Jeb Bush signed the Statement of Principles in June , 1967 along with other RW neo @-@ conservatives who lead us into the Iraq war , economic chaos and the death and injury of thousands of Americans .
Anyone who supports Jeb Bush or any neo @-@ conservative is a fool !
See @: <a href="http://www.newamericancentury.org/statementofprinciples.htm"> Statement of Principles </a>
From your link @:
Our aim is to remind Americans of these lessons and to draw their consequences for today .
Here are four consequences @: • we need to increase defense spending significantly if we are to carry out our global · responsibilities today and modernize our armed forces for the future ;
• we need to strengthen our ties to democratic allies and to challenge regimes hostile to our interests and values ;
• we need to promote the cause of political and economic freedom abroad ;
• we need to accept responsibility for America 's unique role in preserving and extending an international order friendly to our security , our prosperity , and our principles .
I see absolutely nothing wrong with those goals .
I take it that you would suggest quite the opposite ?
That 's coming along just fucking splendidly so far @...
I would like to see Jeb back in elected office .
He is a voice of reason within the Republican party
Would n't Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio make an awsome ticket in 2016 ?
The president and vice @-@ president can n't be from the same state .
49 @-@ 44 does not indicate a strong challenge .
If an incumbent is polling behind the challenger then it 's a strong challenge .
However , as with every other poll threads have been started about regarding 2012 , this one is just as irrelevant .
The election is two years away so it does n't matter what the poll says today .
Really ?
1 st I heard that one .
Care to link that one ?
Here
I 'll help @:
According to usconstitution.net , "@ A. The Constitution does n't say that they can not be from the same state .
However , the 12 th Amendment does say that electors may not vote for a President from their state and a Vice President also from their state .
This issue came up in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_presidential_campaign"> 2000 presidential campaign </a> when Texas Governor George W. Bush chose fellow Texas resident Richard Cheney to be his running mate .
Cheney , who had served in Congress as a Representative from Wyoming , quickly changed his legal residence back to Wyoming to avoid the possible conflict for electors from Texas .
Court challenges to Cheney 's change of residency were denied .
It is unlikely that two people from the same state would ever be nominated by a major political party .
It is constitutionally possible however .
If it ever came to pass , the party that won the ticket 's state would likely suggest to the electors that their votes for the President go to the presidential nominee and that the votes for the Vice President be given in honor of a party official .
Electors in all other states , as mentioned above , would be free to vote for both of the party 's nominees .
<a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Can_the_vice_president_and_president_come_from_the_same_state"> Answers.com - Can the vice president and president come from the same state </a>
can n't happen · you can not have both members of a ticket from the same state
Here
answers.com is a poor source · at least for a definitive answer
I do n't know if he wants to be a senator .
They tried to draft him in the last race but he turned them down .
Nelson 's a weak candidate but if the GOP nominates someone weak as well - like they did with that Kathy chick with all the make @-@ up who was responsible for the vote count in 2000 - then Nelson will win .
Jeb is done with politics , I predict .
He 's making too much money , cashing in from his Governorship .
Jeb has always been more about money than politics .
He 's more like his brother Neil than his father .
Plus , who the hell in his right mind would ever vote for another Bush ?
Of course , if he did run , the Right @-@ tards here would fawn all over him , swearing that this Bush is a conservative .
No @...
really @...
he 's a conservative @...
not like his brother @...
this time it 's for real @...
not like his father @...
nope @...
he 's the real deal !!!
Bush asked former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense"> Secretary of Defense </a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Cheney"> Dick Cheney </a> to head up a team to help select a running mate for him , but ultimately , Bush decided that Cheney should be the vice presidential nominee .
While the U.S. Constitution does not specifically disallow a president and a vice president from the same state , it '@ does @' prohibit electors from casting both of his or her votes for persons from his or her own state .
Accordingly , Cheney @—@ who had been a resident of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas"> Texas </a> for nearly 10 years @—@ changed his voting registration back to Wyoming .
Had Cheney not done this , either he or Bush would have forfeited their electoral votes from the Texas electors .
i know its wiki , but that is a better source
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_presidential_campaign"> United States presidential election , 2000 - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia </a>
actually , based on his actions as Governor , Jeb is far more conservative than his brother or his dad
Here
All it 's saying is that voters from that particular vote can;t vote for *@ both @* .
So the VP would n't carry that state .
56 other states to choose from .
All I can really say is either accept that source or provide a better , more "@ definitive @" , one
Like I said @...
i voted for Jeb when i lived there · you know nothing about him , fuck off
God , why could n't that jap gunner in WWII have aimed a little better and prevented this from ever happening ?
Not funny .
Not appropriate .
GHW Bush is a great American hero , with his actions and bravery in WWII .
And he was a pretty damn good president , too , especially compared to the guy right before him .
Reagan 's horrible policies started to come home to roost under Bush 's term .
He 's a victim of prior incompetence in the same way Obama is , only to a much , much , much , much lesser degree .
Oh no , not Neg rep , what will I ever do ?
While your hero George was busy being a lousy pilot and getting rescued by a submarine , Prescott was busy channelling money to Hitler .
Just imagine , only a few more inches and no S&L scandal , no rigged election , no Iraq war , the possibilities are endless .
You make this sound like a bad thing .
holy shit
I 'm feeling better about the stupid shit I posted , earlier today , more and more by the minute
Jeb almost seems a shoe in , he 's already beating Nelson in a hypothetical match up .
By Christina Bellantoni · Roll Call Staff · Dec. 27 , 2010 , 5 @:@ 27 p.m.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is the strong favorite among Republican voters to challenge Sen. Bill Nelson ( D ) in 2012 , a new Public Policy Polling survey shows .
Bush leads a hypothetical matchup , 49 percent to Nelson ’s 44 percent .
Among the more likely candidates
<a href="http://www.rollcall.com/news/-201952-1.html?ET=rollcall:e9548:80104117a:&st=email&pos=epol"> Florida Republicans Want Jeb Bush to Challenge Nelson : Roll Call </a>
I take it back , YOU 'RE the typical , played out , lib drone .
Those goals =
^^Case and fuckin point^^
I have n't neg repped you .
Jeb would make a great Senator .
He has experience and clout within his party .
He would offer a sane voice and moderation within the party
Too bad he can n't run for President
Ditto .
Its way to bad he will n't run for President .
Jeb would have to cheat to win a national election .
The republicans can n't cheat that much anymore because the electronic machines are being watched more closely now .
It 's a Senate race
Jeb replacing Nelson would be too awesome !!!!
Bush / Rubio ticket in 2016 ?
Let 's see how Obama 's replacement works out first !
not as big a fool as a spammer trying to sell shit in their sig

Must a mass email from the DNC .
I wonder if Jeb would bow before the the Saudi Monarch , hold his hand , and walk on grass so that the filthy muslim dictator could use the concrete sidewalk like your tyrannical hero George the II did ?
Of course he would .
The Bushes have been in bed with the Saudis for decades .
Why do you think Bush let all the Saudis get out of the country on chartered jets so fast after 9 / 11 ?

It 's important to note that Buffet has significant investments in Life Insurance Companies .
The Life Insurance Lobby is one of the strongest supporters of the Estate Tax .
One way to get around the Estate Tax is to buy very expensive life insurance coverage .
Bill Gates jr and sr. also support the estate tax , are you gonna tell me that they have a vested interest in life insurance too ?
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2003-01-12-gates_x.htm"> USATODAY.com - Gates Sr. supports estate tax </a>
<a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/stevenbertoni/2010/10/28/bill-gates-fighting-microsoft-ballmer-allen-and-other-billionaires-on-tax/"> Bill Gates Fighting Microsoft , Ballmer , Allen And Other Billionaires On Tax - Steven Bertoni - Money Talks - Forbes </a>
Until you people look at the loopholes for Gate 's and Buffet 's estates , I certainly would n't be using them as stellar examples to prove your points .
The relatives will be well taken care of through the Trusts .
Not much will be able to be taxed , because of the charities within the Trusts .
I have to laugh at some of you for even bringing these fine examples of capitalism to the forefront .
actually your an idiot .
Most of Buffetts and Gates estates are actually being donated to charity .
Buffets business will be taken over by his children .
but they will only be assuming leadership , since the majority of Buffetts wealth is in his shares of Berkshire Hathaway , it will be transfered to the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation over the next few years in the form of stock .
Which will then be sold on the open market and the proceeds will benefit the charity .
Buffett wants his children to earn their own money like he did , not get it free .
nice try with him simply giving his money to his heirs tax free .
You have to look a little closer than that .
No , I 'm not an idiot @....
the keyword is charities , and who are on the boards of those charities .
But , keep trying @....
Yep all income should be taxed exactly the same no matter how you got it .
Even if it 's already been taxed once ?
Tell me , do you pay taxes at the grocery store on the food you buy and then pay taxes again when you eat it ?
How many bites of the apple does the gubmint get ?
The answer is @....
NO .
You do n't pay again for it when you eat it .
But I 'm sure if they could figure out a way they would try to tax what we put in our mouths when we put it in our mouths and then again when it comes out of our asses .
Not everyone is as rich or as selfish towards his kids as Bill Gates is .
It 's funny all those on here that do n't have a problem with the "@ estate tax @" do n't have a dog in the fight .
I 'd wager most are on the govt.
dole in some fashion .
As for me I have worked for many years for the wealth I 've aquired and my children should reap all the benefits , after all they 're the reason I worked my ass off all these years .
And for this they should be made to pay taxes on money that has already been taxed ?
It 's time we get every single liberal puke out of Washington and make government , the government our forefathers invisioned , which is to insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and future generations .
You are n't going to be subject to an estate tax .
And if you were , I 'd question your values in the claim that your little angels need more than $ 5 million + 65 % of the wealth in excess of that .
How are they ever going to learn the value of hard work just like you did ?
When you buy groceries with your paycheck , that money has been taxed .
When the grocery store profits from your purchase , they get taxed .
When the grocer buys new furniture with his taxed earnings , the furniture store gets taxed on their profits .
So yes , money gets taxed , generally , every time it changes hands .
I do n't know why that 's so difficult to grasp .
Damn you 're stupid .
Translated @: "@ Fuck he 's right @...
What do I do @...
Ok let 's just call him stupid . @"
Oh boo hoo hoo !
I 'll only get to start out with a sum only equivalant to 100 years the median average PRETAXED incomes of the American family .
That 's not fair !
wah !
wah wah !
What right does the government have to something it had already taxed and taken their ( incorrect ) '@ fair share @' ?
You 're right .
It is NOT fair to double tax .
I 'm not ?
Can I get a written guarantee on that ?
The values my children do or do not learn is of no concern to you .
Oh and you 're not me .
No you 're not right , you say every time money changes hands it gets taxed , but you fail to recognize that money earned and that has been taxed will be taxed a second time upon death per the estate tax .
Your comparing money that has been earned , taxed , spent thus being earned by another party , taxed and spent again etc. etc. @..
not the same as the estate tax at all .
You fail !
Should n't Barney Frank be wrapping his mouth around something else ?
Other People 's money should not be his concern - look what his Pet Housing Project for the Poor and Downtrodden has resulted in for everybody .
And THAT is the debate being had .
The 35 % on amounts over $ 5 M is the compromise , and frankly , it 's a compromise that 's slanted incredibly far to the right .
But it just ai n't good enough is it ?
No no , we need *@ NO @* estate tax at all .
Tough shit .
We live in a society where everyone gets a voice , and this is the current policy .
Chances are it will move more to the middle over time .
And stop worrying about it @...
Nobody believes you 're worth $ 5 M so give it up , man !
Tell ya what ; PM me .
When you die , if there 's an estate tax , have your kids send me the bill and I 'll take care of it .
Your kids will n't lose a cent to inheritance taxes , I 'll wager .
And if your kids can not make it with 100 years worth of the PRETEXED median salaries of their fellow Americans families combined , then honestly @...
are they even suited to having that much money to begin with ?
If a scion can not make it with $ 5 million TAX FREE dollars , then honestly what good does it do them ( but more importantly the rest of us ) to have still more money ?
The estate tax in my state starts at a million .
Take your tired rethoric and lust for others wealth some where else .
I hear cuba is looking for a few good communists .
You would be a shoe in
Vote with your feet then , dood .
Move to Rwanda .
They have no estate tax .
Democrats will force a vote by firearm .
I am sticking around for that .
With me its a passion .
What state do you live in ?
One of 50 or one of 57 if you listen to the CIC
Earned wealth is neither liberal nor conservative .
It is the property of someone .
Inheritance has already been taxed .
All inheritance should be tax free .
Transfer of wealth from a family that had earned it to one that has not is a way to fund government that spends too much $$ .
If government would spend as much time looking for ways to slow the growth and cut spending of government as it does looking for ways to rob citizens at the point of a gun the budget would not be a problem .
But most conservatives are also liberals when it comes to cutting THEIR "@ entitlement @" program .
Hell no is their answer then .
you do pay income tax on your paycheck and the sales tax on consumable goods ?
what is n't that double taxation ?
damn did i just through a wrench in your argument about the same money being taxed twice ?
and food is actually not taxable .
Your right , we are being double and sometimes triple dipped .
You actually want it to continue and get quadruple and quintuple dipped ?
How about our pay checks just go to the gubmint and they give everyone an equal share to meet their needs ?
By the way , if food is n't taxable @.......
why do I pay taxes on it at the grocery store ?
Depends where you live .
Medicine is also taxable here .
Gubmint needs their cut of my pie after all .
You know , you 're right .
Everyone in our society gets a voice .
What they should n't get , is access to my checkbook by government force .
Fuck them !
Go earn your own damn living .
I agree , we need NO estate tax at all .
BTW I do n't care what you or anyone else believes .
If what Barney Frank says is true , that what you inherit is n't worked for thus should be taxed at 55 % , what does that say about what the government gets in taxes from us ?
The government did n't work for it .
Why do they feel they have a right to all of that money ?
This assumes that what we did n't actually work for automatically belongs to the government .
This is why Barney Frank 's argument is wrong .
You should n't be taxed higher just because , in his opinion , you did n't work for it .
As long as it 's legal it does n't matter how you got it .
What right does he have to decide the level of taxation according to how it was obtained ?

The number one goal of Marxism is the removal of private property .
The ownership of all property by the government .
I think we 're seeing this in Barney Frank .
'@ Heirs Did n’t Do Anything to Deserve Inheritance @' @....
jackass @....
this guy needed to go , so bad .
[quote=Common Sense;3117559]
what exactly did heirs do to earn this $ other than being born into that family ?
this is n't a monarchy and never has been .
heirs did n't work a day in their life to earn anything , so why should they be able to get everything for free ?
and the constitution gives the government to right to collect taxes @...
or did you forget about that little clause @...
if you did its article 1 , section 8 as well as the 16 th amendment .
first off , a ) you know this how ?
how many have inheritable / inherited wealth they had no hand in helping create or maintain ?
I 'll wait while you get back to me with those figures @....
b ) who do you think you are ?
so you do n't think someone deserves ?
Oh thank you commissar @...
deserves ??
really ?
Okay @....
I do n't think you deserve internet access 24 a day .
hows that ?
what did you do to make that happen ?
c ) your envy , no jealousy , is noted .
well internet access is a pay service so you can try to limit my usage , but it will n't work .
now if an heir to a business actually works at the business , then it can be passed on to them without much tax consequence .
all you need to do is hire a lawyer and go through the proper channels and paperwork .
so you 'll now create a gov. agency who will vet inheritances and of they think the son has worked hard enough hes okay to forgo the tax ?
You 're pulling my leg , right ?
because thats not the way it works , its taxed as an asset and due in CASH within a year .
but many heirs did not actually do anything to deserve the $ other than being born .
lets look at the Hilton sisters .
no jobs at the hotel , no college education , nothing but being born a hilton .
do they deserve have the family business ?
what about actors children ?
or politicians children ?
or musicians children ?
they obviously had no hand in creating the family wealth , yet the benefit for the simple reason of being born into that family .
who cares ?
the money that is spun off the bus .
has already been taxed , so has the income that created a simple cash inheritance .
i do n't have any dog in the fight .
especially since any estates i stand to inherit will fall well below the estate tax threshold .
plus my family has basically said they are gonna spend everything "@ they @" earned before they die .
which i said more power to them .
i did n't feel entitled to their money because im their child .
its their money , i did n't do anything to help them earn it .
well if its '@ their money @' than why are you campaigning to mess with mine ?
If I inherited 10 millon bucks it would mean absolutely zero zip nada to you or your situation .
[quote=Trajan;3117843]
Well you see , people who built their own wealth to take care of their family are really greedy bastards who do n't deserve the fruits of their labor or the right to decide what to do with it .
The government has the right @......
nay , the obligation to recover a portion of that and hand it over to the common man who is n't as "@ lucky @" .
But what if it were above the threshold and they want to give it to you ?
Why would you feel the government is entitled to a portion of what your parents earned and paid taxes on ?
if it were above the threshold , i would be intelligent enough to retain a lawyer and explore the most economical ways to have the estate passed on .
there are many legal avenues to limit the estate tax .
and since they are not taxing my parents , and this is new money to me , then it has the right to be taxed .
im not championing the idea that i like taxes , but with it being new income to my person , it should be subject to taxes .
Were you dropped on your head as a baby ?
No , seriously , were you ?
My father-in-law gave my son his father 's ( f-i-l 's dad and my sons great grandfather ) shotgun .
It was a family possession handed down from generation to generation .
Should my son have been taxed by the government for this family gift ?
It does n't matter if it is a gun , a family picture album , a doily , your old man 's fishnet stocking leg lamp or his monetary fortune .
You posess it and it is yours to do what you choose with it .
Why the fuck should the government be entitled to take a portion of my hard earned wealth I want to pass to my son so they can give it to some crack whore mother so she can have things she did n't work for .
Hell , if she wants some of my money , she can come ask for a handout .
I 'm a very charitable person .
But I decide how and where my money goes .
I do n't need the gubmint being the middle man .
If you decided you need a piece of my financial pie and went about coming in my house to confiscate it for yourself , I 'd be justified in a court of law for putting a nice grouping in your chest to stop you .
Why should the gubmint be able to do by force what citizens are not allowed to by gubmint law ?
Get it thru your head .
A person 's possessions belongs to them and they can do with it what they will and can give it to whoever they choose .
You are not entitled to it if they do n't want you to have it and the gubmint should n't be able to take it by force and give it to you .
If they do @.......
what are you going to give in return ?
gifting and estate taxes are separate issues .
and since the gun falls under the limit , its not taxed anyway .
try again @......
also , if you wanted to legally pass on your estate and it was over the $ 5 M threshold , go hire and lawyer and he will be able to limit the estate taxes .
stop making excuses .
Making excuses ?
Would n't that be you thinking the government is entitled to part of a person 's estate ?
You 've never explained why the government has a right to it other than they can make rules and enforce them at gunpoint .
Why is the government entitled to it ?
You 've never answered that .
This is income that was taxed when it was earned that has been passed to a family member @......
no different than some other possession .
Why is the government entitled to it other than it is easy pickings and they can send people to your house with guns to get it ?
all income is taxed multiple times .
every time it changes hands it is taxed again .
your taxed on your income , then again on the sales , then again on property , then again and again .
its the same as you winning the lottery , its free money to the person who receives it .
an estate also does n't necessarily have to be passed on to a family member .
should your neighbor or friend get it tax free as well ?
whats the difference there ?
Not by the same entity .
Yes , I pay federal and state taxes on each pay check .
When I go to the grocery store with the money I earned that the government actually allows me to keep , I pay a LOCAL sales tax .
My property taxes are to the COUNTY .
Now , if I were being taxed on my income by the feds and then paying a federal tax at the gorcery store , you might have an argument .
The federal government already got a piece of the action each time I get paid .
If I choose to give money to my son , they are not entitled to retax what they already taxed .
It 's not your money anymore when you die .
In fact the royal "@ You @" ai n't anymore after you die .
Your wealth is transferred elsewhere .
And when wealth is transferred , Uncle Sam gets his cut .
Sorry dude .
Rwanda .
No estate tax .
I 'll help ya pack .
you got me @...
I am speechless.good luck in life .
where does it say that , exactly ?
One can alway 's choose to go into a life of crime , Prostitution , Smuggling , Drugs , Larceny , Counter @-@ fitting , Embezzlement , Fraud , work on the level of experience , if you really want to go all out , apply it to becoming a Lawyer , Judge , Politician , Union Boss , or Community Organizer .
I hear those skills translate real well into a career in Government .
So I take it you do not live in a state or community that has an income or payroll tax ?
Many communities have a payroll tax for the priveledge of working in their community whether you live in the community or not .
so the state taxes you on your income and then again with a sales tax when you spend it .
It is not that the tax exists , it is what is done with what is levied , it is about consent , it is about acting responsibly with a trust .
What is Governments primary function again Citizen ???
What are It 's Powers ?
What are the Limits to those Powers ?
What is it 's obligation in relation to transparency ?
Disclosure ?
Rule Of Law ?
Should the Government account for what it takes ?
for what it spends ?
For Hypocrisy ?
And guess how many businesses choose to invest capital in buildings , infrastructure and such in those communities .
We run like a bat out of hell when a municipality initiates taxes like that .
Lower taxes means businesses are going there .
What is the governments primary function ?
Well one of the first acts of the new american govt was to levy the whiskey tax which must be paid in specie at a time when much of frontier america existed primarially on barter .
Washington led a group group of soldiers larger than at any revoloutionary war battle into western PA to enforce the collection of the tax .
Think about it .
Ohh they give the businesses all kinds of tax free incentives even loans that do not have to be repaid to locate there .
And then collect the payroll tax off of the workers .
The businesses do not pay the payroll tax the workers do .
Define "@ It . @"
The authority to tax flows from the constitution , Article 1 section 8 .
Corresponding law specific to the estate tax can be found in the federal register .
If you 're asking where '@ it @' says that when you die , it 's not your money anymore @...
I 'm not sure how to answer that .
I 'm not sure '@ it @' says it anywhere ; that 's just the way it is .
A dead man does n't own anything .

We wait with baited breath .
You did n't pay attention to what I said .
I live in Oklahoma and we have a STATE income tax .
When I buy groceries , I pay LOCAL ( CITY ) taxes .
My property taxes are a COUNTY tax .
The state gets theirs off the top out of my income .
The city and the city alone gets a cut when I buy someting in a store .
The state does n't get a piece of that action .
They already got theirs when they taxed my income .
That 's right @.........
because upon his death he bequeathed it to his family .
Where in the constitution does it say that when you die , the government is entitled to your wealth ?
If you had no living relatives and you had no will directing a charity or something to leave your wealth to , I could see the government taking it .
But if you direct for your wealth to remain within your family , there is no logical reason for the government to demand a piece of it other than they can take it by force .
An income tax is not mentioned by name in the Constitution , either .
Neither is the Air Force or the Department of Homeland Security .
Something does not need to be mentioned by name in order to be constitutionally compliant .
With regards to the government being entitled to a percentage of certain estates upon death , that can be found in the federal register as I stated .
Dude , the government is entitled to whatever they say they are entitled to .
They have guys with guns to enforce it .
Does n't make it right .
Constitutionally Compliant is exactly what the Supreme Court says it is , no more , no less , and only until the Court revises it .
That is our system , not original Intent , but Constructive Interpretation and Law .
Kind of arbitrary , with no means to challenge the Court .
"@ I am conscious that an equal division of property is impracticable , but the consequences of this enormous inequality producing so much misery to the bulk of mankind , legislators can not invent too many devices for subdividing property , only taking care to let their subdivisions go hand in hand with the natural affections of the human mind .
The descent of property of every kind therefore to all the children , or to all the brothers and sisters , or other relations in equal degree , is a politic measure and a practicable one .
Another means of silently lessening the inequality of property is to exempt all from taxation below a certain point , and to tax the higher portions or property in geometrical progression as they rise " -- Thomas Jefferson ; letter to James Madison ( October 28 , 1785 )
So we can count on your support of confiscatory inheritance taxes ?
I would like to know what right the federal government has in the taking of property that undoubtedly has been taxed many times over just because someone had the wherewithal to safeguard and put it good use before they passed from this life ?
Why should a family farm for example have to be sold off to donate 55 % of the proceeds to the federal government ?
Why should a husband and wife who busted their asses to accumulate an estate to pass on to their children see over half of it land in the hands of government bureaucrats who will then take that money and spend it on utter nonsense ?
A word of caution @.....
If you want you head bitten off and treated as spewtum , give me that "@ civic duty @" or "@ the price of freedom @" bullshit @....
Do n't forget that the Parliament that oppressed the colonists were members of a landed aristocracy , so this was a great concern to the likes of Jefferson .
I do n't think that a flat 55 % rate is fair or conducive to "@ the great object . @"
A progressive rate like that that Jefferson speaks of would be far better .
Of course it would .
However , try convincing those in the class envy and war on wealth people on the political Left .
"@ Just three years after Medicare was passed , a 1968 Tax Foundation study found that public spending on medical care had nearly doubled in the first few years of Medicare .
The report concluded , "@ To date , the major demonstrable effect of the 1965 federal legislation creating Medicare and Medicaid has been a shift in financing medical care from the private to the public sector .
- New York Times , September 9 , 1968 .
It 's the same story today , they selling us story that prices will go down .
They will n't .
Even LBJ was lying about it back in sixties .
Johnson maneuvered every step of the way getting this bill through Congress , and one of the things he did — and this is a little dicey in today 's climate — was suppress the costs .
So this young kid gets elected from Massachusetts , Ted Kennedy , in 1962 , and Johnson is explaining to him [ over the phone ] how you get a health bill through .
And what he tells him is do n't let them get the costs projected too far out because it will scare other people @:
"@ A health program yesterday runs $ 300 million , but the fools had to go to projecting it down the road five or six years , and when you project it the first year , it runs $ 900 million .
Now I do n't know whether I would approve $ 900 million second year or not .
I might approve 450 or 500 .

The bill also assumes savings by cutting Medicare .
Every time they have cut Medicare the Congress has voted to restore funding .
Why is this going to be different ?
But the CBO scoring also is good for just the first decade , when as you say payments precede benefits .
After that they admit they can n't score the thing .
and there is other stuff in there too that came out at the "@ bipartisan @" meeting .

They are so desperate they will tkae a Pyrrhic victory .

Yes , the wonderful CBO , that takes all the rules and numbers given to it and renders possible results .
The CBO or its equivalent has been wrong on every social program 's cost .
With even the slightest bit of honesty you could at least admit this plan does n't reduce health care costs .
Most of the leadership has already noted the RATE of increase is suppose to decrease .
I guess that makes it affordable now and less affordable later huh ?

I think we will see a renewed energy pushing for term limits at the tea parties that are springing up all over the nation .
Make sure to attend yours , I took the day off to go .
It 's April 15 th , check with your local chamber of commerce , they will be able to tell you where yours is at .
We the people already determine Term Limits with our VOTE .
Find me anything in the Constitution that can limit the terms of eligable people for the House or Senate .
It would take a Constitutional Amendment .
Which is a waste of time and money .
I am beyond tired of lazy helpless people to STUPID to exersize their rights with the vote .
Do n't like a Congress or Senate Critter , VOTE them OUT .
But no , we are to weak willed and helpless to actually do that , instead we want the Government to make it easy for us by forcing people out so we do n't have to actually think or exersize our minds and rights .
This is so 100 % on the mark .
Why should a very good legislator be limited in how long he / she can serve ?
We have the opportunity every election cycle to remove anyone from office who is not representing our interests .
If we are too dumb that we can be bought off with slick advertising then we deserve what we get .
You can bet your buckwheat that if the writers of our constitution were alive today they would have wrote in term limits for the congress and the senate .
They would have been disgusted at what we see on a daily basis , corruption , special interests in the back pockets of our so-called leaders and those politicians living the life of riley , staying on the government gravy train until they die .
They most certainly would not have wanted this and it is clear that this needs to change , let 's bring to the forfront the need for term limits and get it done this time .
It will be a fight but I believe it 's a fight that we the people can win .
How about no pay God knows there all over paid
Oh , there is another -- a meterologist @....
I doubt their salary is as high though .
All of us want change , this is not a partisan issue , it does not matter if you are a republican , democrat , independent , conservative or liberal .
We are not going to get significant change until we the people impose term limitaions on congress and the senate .
Too many congressmen and senators have made a career out of a political office , Kennedy , Kerry , McCain , Barney Frank , Chris Dodd , Nancy Pelosi , and the list goes on and on .
They become entrenched in their white ivory towers , forgetting what it 's like in the real world .
They succomb to special interest groups , they become corrupt with power and money from these groups and eventually they entirely ignore their constituants .
Is it any wonder to any of you why this country seems so divided .
I do n't believe that we the people are divided , I believe our congress and senate are .
They all form their clicks , play their power games , and in the end , get nothing done for the American people .
I think that most of us want the same thing , affordable health care , energy independence , , an educational system that works and a social security system that is feasible and will n't be bankrupt for future generations .
We need a government that can balance a budget , use tax payer dollars efficiently , eliminates waste and fraud , and creates opportunities for growth in the private sector .
We will never get there with entrenched politicians who have made careers out of being ego centric , counter productive individuals whose only concern is power and money and getting their faces on television in order to be re @-@ elected .
Most of these politicians have never had to work a real day in their lives , they have an omnipotent veiw of themselves and really think that we the people could not live without their leadership .
We can , and we would do a much better job with new people with fresh ideas .
The new ones want to do what is right , they have not had the time to be corrupted by special interest groups or old entrenched politicians .
Let 's give them each two terms and then there out .
That 's the only way we are ever going to get the change we need and want in this country .
Support term limits and get to your tea party on the 15 th of April .
This is the real change this country needs .
We have term limits in the White House .
How 's that going for you ?
It 's almost funny the way that some Rs just assume that if there were term limits , Repubs would win the majority back .

I voted for Hillary during the primaries and would have been satisfied if she won the nomination .
As a rule , I vote for women running for Congress and City Counsil position before I vote for men , regardless of party .
I think it 's categorically false to say that women hate women just to hate them .
there is usually a basis for that hate .
Sometimes the basis if jealousy or bitterness .
Sometimes it 's much more tangible .
It seems that women started turning on Palin when Palin started talking .
Perhaps the main issue with Palin is that she poorly represents women and therefore is looked upon as setting back our efforts to gain respect and position in national politics .
Hillary lost the primary not because women turned on her @..
quite the opposite .
She lost the primary because she forgot to run an honorable campaign .
She turned into the dirty mud slinging typical politician .
For her it was more about winning that showing some integrity .
I believe if she had n't sunk so low and made so many personal attacks she might 've gotten the nod for VP .
Hillary burned her own bridge there .
Palin did too .
a
Okay , fair enough .
Then those SOME women are stupid .
It is n't any woman 's fault that she does n't like Palin , btw . It 's Palin 's fault , and her job , to make people like her .
And pissing and moaning that all these women are somehow at fault is ridiculous .
No one is blaming the women , silly .
They were born that way .
Some polls are suggesting that after gaining an initial bump , McCain 's campaign is being hobbled by Sarah Palin 's vice @-@ presidential candidacy .
The voters who are deserting her fastest , some of whom are even calling on her to withdraw , are mostly women .
Ah , women , the consistently , tragically underestimated constituency .
What the Democrats learned during the primaries and the Republicans might now be finding out the hard way , I learned at my very academic , well @-@ regarded all @-@ girls high school @: that is never to discount the ability of women to open a robust , committed , well @-@ thought @-@ out vat of hatred for another girl .
Women are weapons @-@ grade haters .
Hillary Clinton knows it .
Palin knows it too .
When women get their hate on , they do n't just dislike , or find disfavor with , or sort of not really appreciate .
They loathe — deeply , richly , sustainingly .
I do not say this to disparage my gender ; women also love in more or less the same way .

Wow , I do n't that could have been a more offensive article about women .
I have sent that to numerous of my lady friends and they were not pleased .
They are now in the process of writing letters to the author and I guarantee you they are not positive .
Plays right into the stereotypes of women and is quite sad if you ask me .
Sounds like a female writing for her male editors to me .
I 'm always amazed at how little some dudes understand the fairer sex .
Women do n't like palin because she 's unqualified and rightwing
oh yes @--@ the poor female can n't think for herself and is being forced to write bad shit in the back room where she is chained up .
Besides @--@ sterotypes all have some general truths in them or they would n't exist .
What we need to do is stop and consider what we want in a candidate , rather than we just do n't like their party .
That is , if we are being honest to ourselves .
For example , are Earmarks a bad thing or a good thing ?
Maybe it is the responsibility of a politician to grab all he can for his constituents .
Therefore McCain might be considered lazy .
Does a politician who spend all his time shaking down the money tree for his district really do that much of a disservice ?
There are a lot of inter related issues in the drilling debate .
The Republicans have framed it in terms of national security .
That is not the end of it .
The Democrats have framed it in terms of responsible stewardship .
And that is not the end of that either .
My personal preference is to ride a bike to work .
I live two miles away , and I just like riding my bike .
I am a bit of an evangelist , as I think everyone else who can ought to as well .
I am nearly 50 , so it is n't that hard .
I do my shopping usually on the way home .
I am now single , so I only have to shop for me .
Shopping for more people on the bike would be harder , I know .
Do we really need to send all that cash that we spend on oil to kleptocratic theocracies like Iran and Saudi Arabia ?
Do we really , for that matter , need to make a mess of out our environment either ?
The reality I see is that Petroleum is still substantially cheaper than biofuels .
the folks who do chemestry are working really hard to change that , but they have n't yet .
So that is the choice we have to make , rationally .
I personally think spending money on regimes like Iran , Saudi Arabia , Venezuela , etc. etc. is dangerous .
the caribou are just going to have to live with it .
But that is my feeling on the matter , Your mileage may vary .
But we have to recognize these are both valid choices and we have to come down on one or the other .
It really is your call
This maybe an oversimplification but does n't it come down to the fact that we need income @---@ we need to decide the optimal ( moral ? )
way of doing that and then prioritize our spending ?
We had lower Year over Year ( YoY ) spending under Clinton too .
It was the combination of lower spending and higher taxes that generated a surplus .
Obama is n't going to cut spending and McCain will only focus on a quarter of one percent represented by "@ bad @" earmarks .
There is no shot at a balanced budget under either man .
Obama is going to cut spending by $ 200 billion dollars a year .
He is going to get us out of Iraq .
Because the money gets spent to the federal government for lease payments , and for US workers and equipment , and does not get spent enriching governments and dictators that do n't exactly have our best interest at heart .
And the oceans will no longer rise and the planet will begin to heal itself .
Let me try this one .
Social security benefits have their limits and regardless how much money you make , you can n't get more from social security then you put in over the time .
Yes
When talking about fairness , if you remove cap on payroll tax , woudn't be fair to remove cap on social security benefits and give to rich equivalent in social security based on how much money they put in .
Not a bad idea .
So if cap is ( rounded ) $ 100 K , your SS check is ( wild guess ) $ 1500 .
If you remove cap on rich and tax them across the board , would be fair to still pay them social security just $ 1500 or maybe more , since they paid more taxes .
The CAP on SSI is too low .
No , Obama wants to remove the cap on payrol and keep the cap on SS benefits .
Fair enough ?
A complaint that this liberal thinks has merit .
While I do believe there should be some cap , I certainly think it 's set artificially low , now .
Somebody who , under Obama 's plan , contributes huge amounts of money to the system deserves to get back more of that money than they currently do .
That was one of the most pointless replies I 've ever seen .
Instead of defending McCain , you went on an attack against Obama .
Try staying on subject @:
McCain is a foreign policy disaster in the making .
The weirdest thing that wingers do n't get is that defining people as '@ Liberal @' or '@ Leftist @' does n't mean that they 're wrong or bad @:
In the 1960 s we were a terrible nation .
We were at war fighting against the sovereignty of the Vietnamese people .
WE WERE THE BAD GUYS !!!
That war violated every principle that America was founded on .
The treatment of non @-@ white people was attrocious .
Few people under the age of 50 remember how bad it was .
While the personal suffering of individuals who were killed by leftist bombers is a horrible thing , these leftist radicals were fighting for a just cause .
In the end they won .
This country changed dramatically because of them .
At the same time , does John McCain ever consider the people that he most likely killed or maimed ?
He believed in his cause , but that does n't mean that he should completely disregard the innocent people that were killed by his bombs @:
A bomber in a neat uniform with a nice haircut , flying a jet airplane is still A BOMBER .
Not one word from him of concern for these people .
Why Liberals do n't normally win the Presidency @....
It 's funny you put a hit piece about a man who fought for his country and sacrificed physically .
A man who refused early release so that he did n't abandon his fellow soliders .
While you defend radicals that bomb innocent people .
MCcain followed the orders he was given by his commanders and I do n't think you will find too many democrats that will support a position of our soliders being some type of thugs .
While there are a few democrats on here that will support that , you all are the minority even in your party ( at least I hope so ) .
I can find a lot of faults with McCain but his sevice to our country is n't one of them .
He has a lot of experience where foregn policy is concerned , but I disagree with most of his positions on Middle East affairs that seem to have got us bogged down fighting a war on 2 fronts .
I doubt he would show much restraint where military force is concerned .
Ayup !
I am glad you support the troops @....
Although , I disagree that Mccain will send troops into harm 's way at every whim .
McCain is losing it .
Everytime I see him speak , there is a pause and then his ingratiating little smile or smirk appears .
I never trusted people who laugh at their own so called funnies even when they are n't funny .
He calls Obama an elitist while he Mc Cain owns 5 homes and his wife is worth 600 million .
He talks about his religious foundations , but he cheated on his first wife and divorced her when she gained weight after taking prescribed medicine after an accident .
He was against the tax breaks and drilling and is now for it .
He says he backs the troops but has consistently voted against bills that support more education and medical benefits .
It 's his last time , he knows it , and will say or do what ever he needs to to win .
And no one is pushing the Singing Songbird of Hanoi angle .
The left does n't has the skill the right had in twisting Kerry 's service with the TurdBoat veterans .

Is your health care rationed ?
Yes it is .
There are procedures and medications the Government does not cover .
In my specific case several medications I take I can not get at the military hospital because they are not on the list of approved medications so instead I have to use the Tricare system and pay my share rather then get them for free .
And some of them require lots of paper work from the doctor to justify every time it is due for refill .
I have bad legs , I need support stockings to keep from losing my legs , guess what ?
The stockings are expensive and the Government does not pay at all for them , no cost share or anything , NOT tricare and not Medicare .
I had to spend weeks in physical therapy with my legs wrapped to get the swelling down enough to get the stockings .
All the material I had to buy for those treatments was also not covered .
I can not currently get one of the meds I have taken for years because the Government refuses to pay for it anymore , no cost share nothing , I either have to not take it or pay for it out of pocket .
Currently none of the procedures I have been recommended for are on the no go list , but it exists .
Further in the VA hospital where I could get free treatment there is a laundry list of meds and procedures they simply do not authorize ever .
It is the same for active duty , new procedures that were not pioneered by military doctors take years to get approved before they are authorized by the military .
Wars can speed the process up but as soon as the war is over it goes back to the same old slow approval process .
Dependents that are on the cheapest ( for them ) system of Tricare must wait for space in the Military hospitals or ask for special permission to go out of system ( not always approved ) And Military Hospitals are short staff and priority is given active Duty , as it should be .
I chose the more expensive method for Tricare because currently Medicare pays my deductible or rather between the two I generally pay nothing for routine care .
I did that before I had medicare and paid the extra because if I had signed on for the other way I would have lost my doctors and had to only go through the military and their approved doctors .
I am 90 miles from a VA Hospital so except for a few stays in the mental ward when I was very depressed and could not afford to pay the civilian hospital I do not use it .
When I am up there I can not see my family at all .
I was in and out of the wards , civilian and VA 2 or 3 times a year from 96 to 2000 .
I did not have medicare and had to pay 25 percent of the allowed bill every stay if civilian .
I was not able to work when I was in the hospital and was only getting about 1000 dollars in retirement pay , the wife worked at a low paying job as well .
My doctor even forgave 2 stays cause I could not pay , he was on the board and just had them write off my part of the bill .
Rationing is a fact of life .
It is pretty loose right now for Tricare and the military but not for Medicare and it sure as hell will n't be for long when the Government suddenly has to pay BILLIONS more for everyone .
On veterans day I just wanted to say this pisses me off to no end .
It may be the sadest most disgusting thing I have ever read .
Most of the time I am of the opinion that people should bare some financial burden for their medical expenses , but if there is one group of people that should get free health care , it 's veterans .
That you have to deal with this crap after serving is absolutely disgusting .
It sounds as if your health care coverage rations in the exact same way that private health care does .
The real difference is that your overall coverage cost is cheaper for you @...
Which is proof of what I 've been telling you people all along .
Cheaper does not equal better access , which is suppossedly the goal .
we are going down like a rock @....
and obama ai n't a smidgen of the reasons why @....
i heard this morning on c-span the State governments in the us have a $ 234 TRILLION dollar obligation to government employee retirements .
And the federal government has similar obligations for the retirement pensions and health care fof their exemployees , and the military with their exemployees @....
i do n't know if this health care proposal of the Dems will reduce the speed of the health care prices or save some money in the long run @....
or cost us more , but even without one thing done with this health care bill @....
we , as a country , are in deep deep crapola .
That 's what happens when you try to live off the backs of the successful hardworking people and live beyond your means
I do n't understand ?
Are those of us who have not worked for the government "@ the backs of the successful hard working people @" , and the ones trying to live off of us '@ retired government workers @' ?
Every cent the government has comes from taxes @----@ where do you think they get they money to pay the employees ?
We can not afford socialized medicine .
We already can not afford medicare .
Yet by adding MILLIONS more suddenly all will be fine ?
The primary reasons why Medicare runs in the red is the majority of those covered by medicare subsidized by payroll taxes are n't paying premiums .
Only $ 2.9 billion of its income of nearly $ 231 billion comes from its client base --- which are statistically the sickest demographic ( seniors and disabled ) and with a larger healthier client base , that means more money in revenue vs expenditures .
Cover everyone with Medicare , and the size and overall health of their client base goes up along with the revenue income from premiums .
EVERYONE that works pays into medicare .
EVERYONE .
There is no other way to put it .
Medicare is already subsidized by OUR TAXES from every person in this country that works .
And it fails miserably .
No it does n't .
I 'm not sure that is true .
those who make their income , their living , through investments do NOT PAY MEDICARE taxes .
And it does not fail miserably , if we had NO medicare at all , then look at it @...
you will KNOW what failure is .
in addition to this the private insurance industry is plagued by the same problem and is one reason why we pay higher rates for our own health insurance policies .
This is NOT a copyrighted article and is old , from 1998 talking about the problem @....
back then they said it was $ 100 billion a year in total and $ 12 billion of it was Medicare , so the private industry is filled with it .
Mostly private businesses are the ones committing the crimes against medicare and the insurance industry .
Insurance Fraud and Abuse @: · A Very Serious Problem · Stephen Barrett , M.D.
Fraud and abuse are widespread and very costly to America 's health @-@ care system .
Fraud involves intentional deception or misrepresentation intended to result in an unauthorized benefit .
An example would be billing for services that are not rendered .
Abuse involves charging for services that are not medically necessary , do not conform to professionally recognized standards , or are unfairly priced .
An example would be performing a laboratory test on large numbers of patients when only a few should have it .
Abuse may be similar to fraud except that it is not possible to establish that the abusive acts were done with an intent to deceive the insurer .
Although no precise dollar amount can be determined , some authorities contend that insurance fraud constitutes a $ 100 @-@ billion-a-year problem .
The United States Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) estimates that $ 1 out of every $ 7 spent on Medicare is lost to fraud and abuse and that in 1998 alone , Medicare lost nearly $ 12 billion to fraudulent or unnecessary claims [ 1 ] .
Type of Fraud and Abuse
False claim schemes are the most common type of health insurance fraud .
The goal in these schemes is to obtain undeserved payment for a claim or series of claims [ 2 ] .
Such schemes include any of the following when done deliberately for financial gain @:
* Billing for services , procedures , and / or supplies that were not provided .
* Misrepresentation of what was provided ; when it was provided ; the condition or diagnosis ; the charges involved ; and / or the identity of the provider recipient .
* Providing unnecessary services or ordering unnecessary tests [ 3 ] .
Many insurance policies cover a percentage of the physician 's "@ usual @" fee .
Some physicians charge insured patients more than uninsured ones but represent to the insurance companies that the higher fee is the usual one .
This practice is illegal .
It is also illegal to routinely excuse patients from copayments and deductibles .
( A copayment is a fixed dollar amount paid whenever an insured person receives specified health @-@ care services .
A deductible is the amount that must be paid before the insurance company starts paying . )
It is legal to waive a fee for people with a genuine financial hardship , but it is not legal to provide completely free care or discounts to all patients or to collect only from those who have insurance .
Studies have shown that if patients are required to pay for even a small portion of their care they will be better consumers and select items or services because they are medically needed rather than because they are free .
Routine waivers thus raise overall health costs .
They are considered fraudulent because averaging them with the doctor 's full fees would make the "@ usual @" fees lower than the amounts actually billed for .
Other illegal procedures include @:
* Charging for a service that was not performed .
* Unbundling of claims @: Billing separately for procedures that normally are covered by a single fee .
An example would be a podiatrist who operates on three toes and submits claims for three separate operations .
* Double billing @: Charging more than once for the same service .
* Upcoding @: Charging for a more complex service than was performed .
This usually involves billing for longer or more complex office visits ( for example , charging for a comprehensive visit when the patient was seen only briefly ) , but it also can involve charging for a more complex procedure than was performed or for more expensive equipment than was delivered .
Medicare documentation guidelines describe what the various levels of service should involve [ 4 ] .
* Miscoding @: Using a code number that does not apply to the procedure .
* Kickbacks @: Receiving payment or other benefit for making a referral .
Indirect kickbacks can involve overpayment for something of value .
For example , a supplier whose business depends on physician referrals may pay excessive rent to physicians who own the premises and refer patients .
Another example would be a mobile testing service that performs diagnostic tests in a doctor 's office .
Kickbacks can distort medical decision @-@ making , cause overutilization , increase costs , and result in unfair competition by freezing out competitors who are unwilling to pay kickbacks .
They can also adversely affect the quality of patient care by encouraging physicians to order services or recommend supplies based on profit rather than the patients @' best medical interests .
In 2000 , the Office of the Inspector General issued a fraud alert warning against kickbacks disguised as rental payments [ 5 ] .
Criminals sometimes obtain Medicare numbers for fraudulent billing by conducting a health survey , offering a free "@ health screening @" test , paying beneficiaries for their number , obtaining beneficiary lists from nursing homes or boarding facilities , or offering "@ free @" services , food , or supplies to beneficiaries .
Excessive or Inappropriate Testing
Many standard tests can be useful in some situations but not in others .
The key question in judging whether a diagnostic test is necessary is whether the results will influence the management of the patient .
Billing for inappropriate tests @—@ both standard and nonstandard @—@ appears to be much more common among chiropractors and joint chiropractic / medical practices than among other health @-@ care providers .
The commonly abused tests include @:

Regional inequities in health care reform · Posted on October 15 th , 2009 by kbh in featured , health
In the pending health care bills , low @-@ income individuals and families who buy health insurance outside employment will get large government subsidies .
Those subsidies vary by locale .
This represents a significant implicit policy decision with enormous distributional and political consequences .
I do n’t think most Members or their constituents have focused on this .
I think they should @...
Now let ’s look at what the Baucus bill does for the new low @-@ income subsidies to purchase health insurance outside of employment .
Here is the key sentence from the conceptual description of the Senate Finance Committee @-@ reported bill ( labeled as page 27 , it ’s page 30 of the PDF ) .
The premium credit amount would be tied to the second lowest @-@ cost silver plan in the area where the individual resides .
This is approach ( 2 ) ( and it becomes clear it ’s the extreme when you study the details ) .
If you live in an area with relatively inexpensive health plans , low @- and moderate @-@ income people in your area will receive smaller government subsidies than their similarly @-@ situated identical twins who live in relatively high @-@ cost areas .
A “@ health plan @” is not a commodity like “@ a gallon of milk . @” A health plan in Las Vegas is quite different from one in Portland .
While the overall cost @-@ of @-@ living in Portland is higher , health care spending is much higher in Las Vegas .
This higher health spending is a function of different prices and different usage of medical care .
Atul Gawande wrote a much @-@ discussed article on this topic in The New Yorker , “@ The Cost Conundrum @: What a Texas town can teach us about health care . @” There are wide geographic dispersions in medical care spending , and it can not all be explained by different prices .
While I disagree with Gawande ’s policy conclusions , I recommend the article @....

Fewer jobs means more people on the unemployment line .
I 'm not talking about protecting the industry itself but the individuals like you and I who survive because of it .
But you are n't taking capital out of the system and it is capital that creates jobs .
This is the same argument the left used against free trade and it was a fallacy then and a fallacy now .
But , if you eliminate the company , you eliminate the capital .
Those companies will disappear .
The competition is in the fact that if I ( employer generally ) do n't like the services / costs offered by United Healthcare I can take my business to AETNA .
Two years ago my employer had United Healthcare as its provider .
Last year , AETNA offered us a better deal with rates and deductibles so we switched to AETNA .
This year , United came back with competitive rates and now I am back with United .
Next year ?
Will my employer have such a choice ?
Not sure what you mean here .
It is always , no matter what industry we are speaking of , the provider that determines the price .
It is the purchaser that decides whether or not he / she is willing to pay that price .
When I go to the store tomorrow for bread , the price is already set .
I can pay that price or I can go down the street and see if the next store has a better price .
I can n't go into the first store and say , "@ Your bread is over priced and sliced to thick .
I 'll give you $ 0.50 for a loaf . @"
I have to pay the price the store is asking or go without .
So , I 'm not sure what you mean here .
True , it will not happen over night .
It will happen ( if HR 3200 correct number ? )
were passed it would take no longer than five years before many of the insurers were driven out of business .
As for your Postal Service example , it is a decent one , but there is one major difference between the Postal Service and the public option / health insurance idea .
The government has not mandated that UPS provide its services at $ 0.44 per delivery whereas under the health care plans that have been debated , private insurers are required to provide identical policies at identical prices as the public option and no other policies will be allowed .
Nor will insurers be allowed to offer policies to new customers .
Those two facts , in and of themselves will kill the industry and the videos discussed above prove that this is the goal of our elected politicians . Immie
True , if that is indeed what HR3200 does .
Where does it say that though ?
Do you have a page number ?
No page number and I have not read it in a while , but I think @...
think mind you , can n't swear to it , that it was section 102 .
Although , Plymco_Pilgrim was keeping a good watch on that bill .
Betcha he can tell you exactly how many sentences down from the first page it is .
Okay , maybe not sentences , but lines ?
The question should be why would employers want to deal with this year after year ?
How did healthcare get so tied up with employment ?
I would think the employers would welcome the opportunity to be able to get out of healthcare problems and run their companies .
It would be a boon to them and they could put more of their money into their business , rather than employee healthcare .
Sure you would have BFGRN , sure you would have ?
Just kidding !
So now you are comparing US citizens who happen to work for legal corporations doing the business of keeping you alive with NAZIs that ran concentration camps ?
I do n't see anyone putting ACORN out of business do you ?
I think the President just signed a stimulus package earlier this year , that rewarded them for their service quite well .
In much the same manner as George Bush rewarded Halliburton for its services .
Immie
Except that they are not being given a way out .
In fact , those who have now either chosen or been forced to drop their employee 's coverage will be forced to either pick it up again or pay a fine aka tax , for not providing coverage .
I stated earlier that my employer can not afford it , yet , he continues to insist that his company provides it to the employees .
Many companies simply can not afford it and have been forced out of the market to the detriment of the employees and every year more and more companies or being forced out .
Now , companies are going to be required to cover their employees or be taxed 8 % of their payroll ?
Ouch !
Small business is going to get creamed .
You would n't need to penalize businesses with a single payer plan .
It would work like medicare @...
a portion of your income goes toward the program .
Businesses can n't opt out of medicare , if they would they 'd be penalized .
And again , if no one has to worry about insurance , all kinds of creative stuff could happen .
IMO it would be a boon for anyone with a business plan that was afraid to make a move because they 'd be without insurance ( as it often happens now ) .
many insurance companies will convert to the supplemental health insurance business and elective surgery health insurance @....
also , most of these insurance companies diversify their investments .
Well , a government run plan would have to hire people , too , so it 's not clear to me how many jobs net would be lost or gained .
What we do know is that if private insurance were replaced by government run insurance similar to Canada 's system , massive amounts of capital that insurance companies now invest in our private sector economy would be diverted to buy Treasuries , as Medicare and SS do with their reserve funds , and to pay for the federal government 's deficits .
I 've got to think that withdrawing this much capital from private investment would have a negative effect on economic growth and job creation .
Providing a government option would put Health Care out of business EXACTLY the same way the Post Office put Fed Ex and UPS out of business .
It would be EXACTLY the same .
No difference at all .
The Cobra law does n't suck @...
before there was a Cobra law , when you lost your job , you lost your health insurance @...
The higher Cobra premium reflects A ) the loss of employer participation AND B ) medical providers cut huge deals for employer based insurance claims and the soak the shit out of individual policies @...
WHY are you so f_cking stupid ???
Why are you ?
You get laid off your job , in the next thirty days you get a letter from your employer telling you that you have the option to continue your health insurance coverage .
Within the next 30 days or so , you have to pay last month 's and next month 's health insurance premiums and you must maintain your payments throughout your unemployment and most likely for the 90 days until your new employer picks up your coverage .
That is impossible for the vast majority of people .
What part of that do n't you understand , idiot ?
Oh , and by the way , with the COBRA laws , if you can n't pay you still lose your coverage .
What part of that do n't you understand , stupid ?

THANKS to the evil Democrats !!!
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 as signed by Barack Obama includes a 65 % subsidy to employees for COBRA @-@ enabled insurance for up to 9 months after an involuntary termination .
An employee is eligible for this subsidy if
* the termination of employment was involuntary , · * the terminated employee has no other group sponsored health insurance option , and · * the terminated employee is otherwise eligible to enroll in COBRA .
You are the one that wants free health care , not me and by the way the proposals going through Congress right now are not going to be free .
Yes , before COBRA , an employee was without , after COBRA the employee is still without .
The COBRA law sucked .
It did n't help and the ARRA does n't help a whole hell of a lot either .
The problem is that normal laidoff person could not ( pre @-@ ARRA ) and still can not ( post ARRA ) afford health insurance during such a period .
It does n't help at all .
ARRA is an effort to improve conditions , but it is not sufficient for most people who when laid off have to worry about where the mortgage is going to come from and can n't even begin to worry about how they can pay health insurance premiums .
Even with ARRA it is out of reach .
That is why the COBRA laws suck .
<a href="http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm"> The Case for Universal Health Care in the United States </a>
Why does n’t the United States have universal health care as a right of citizenship ?
The United States is the only industrialized nation that does not guarantee access to health care as a right of citizenship .
28 industrialized nations have single payer universal health care systems , while 1 ( Germany ) has a multipayer universal health care system like President Clinton proposed for the United States .
Myth One @: The United States has the best health care system in the world .
Fact One @: The United States ranks 23 rd in infant mortality , down from 12 th in 1960 and 21 st in 1990
Fact Two @: The United States ranks 20 th in life expectancy for women down from 1 st in 1945 and 13 th in 1960
Fact Three @: The United States ranks 21 st in life expectancy for men down from 1 st in 1945 and 17 th in 1960 .
Fact Four @: The United States ranks between 50 th and 100 th in immunizations depending on the immunization .
Overall US is 67 th , right behind Botswana
Fact Five @: Outcome studies on a variety of diseases , such as coronary artery disease , and renal failure show the United States to rank below Canada and a wide variety of industrialized nations .
Conclusion @: The United States ranks poorly relative to other industrialized nations in health care despite having the best trained health care providers and the best medical infrastructure of any industrialized nation
Myth Two @: Universal Health Care Would Be Too Expensive · Fact One @: The United States spends at least 40 % more per capita on health care than any other industrialized country with universal health care
Fact Two @: Federal studies by the Congressional Budget Office and the General Accounting office show that single payer universal health care would save 100 to 200 Billion dollars per year despite covering all the uninsured and increasing health care benefits .
Fact Three @: State studies by Massachusetts and Connecticut have shown that single payer universal health care would save 1 to 2 Billion dollars per year from the total medical expenses in those states despite covering all the uninsured and increasing health care benefits
Fact Four @: The costs of health care in Canada as a % of GNP , which were identical to the United States when Canada changed to a single payer , universal health care system in 1971 , have increased at a rate much lower than the United States , despite the US economy being much stronger than Canada ’s .
Conclusion @: Single payer universal health care costs would be lower than the current US system due to lower administrative costs .
The United States spends 50 to 100 % more on administration than single payer systems .
By lowering these administrative costs the United States would have the ability to provide universal health care , without managed care , increase benefits and still save money .
"@ the best health care @" and these statistics are interesting to post together , but may or may not have any relation to each other .
All of these stats have more to do with personal choices than the care received should some health crisis arise .
Red meat and overeating among the most prevelant .
How is the consumption of McDonalds world wide compared to USA ?
Save money ?
How much longer will it be before the Massachussetts plan is bankrupt ?
The acid test of this plan will be this @:
If the Senate and the Congress vote to adopt this , they must also vote to dissolve the current plans that they are using and use only this plan as their medical coverage .
If they do not do this , it is inferior .
Period .
I disagree .
When you are comparing market outcomes for a population of 30 individuals , their personal choices make a huge difference on the study outcome , but when comparing a population of 300 million individuals , marketplace and business environment are what will affect the numbers .
The statistics posted are easy enough to read without interpretation .
Regarding the '@ acid test @' you are dead @-@ nuts , right @-@ on @-@ the @-@ money correct .
If congress does not put themselves on to the EXACT SAME PLAN that the rest of us get , it is time to storm the castle with pitch @-@ forks .
Starting in 1984 all newly hired federal employees , including congresscritters , were put on FICA Social Security and the Civil Service plan began to be grandfathered out .
As soon as we can get rid of the congressional deadwood , especially in leadership , hired before 1984 , making sure Social Security is properly funded will become a priority .

Single Universal HC would bring some reductions to the cost of HC insurance premiums as 25 % of all HC rpremiums are spent on administrative costs .
Compared to 5 % administration expenses spent on all medicade and medicare .
Nevertheless I do not believe Single Payer Universal HC will really solve the problems we 're facing .
We must increase the supply of HC at the same time in order to really take this problem by the balls .
As organizations like the AMA actually work to LIMIT the number of MDs , they are working to keep the cost of medicine up , not working to bring it down .
You got that right , Bro @' .
It is disgusting the amount of professional care , like homeopathic medicine and herbal products that are at the least dismissed , and at most illegal due to the power of drug lobbyists and the fear of competition that the people those lobbyists work for have .

What liberal left wing did you come from that you totally fabricated your own facts and are completely ignorant of the true facts ?
And what makes you think this health care system is n't going to cost you out the ass .
The government does n't have it 's own money and if you want to get your health care for free then somebody else had to pay for it , so I guess that means your on welfare too .
The government is already running three health care programs , medicare , medicade and the VA and they have screwed them up so do you think they can run this new healthcare system ?
You 're quite good at the doom and gloom talking points fed you by Big Pharma , and the right wing politicians that receive $ billions from them .
Do you have any facts ?
The fact that nobody seems to be able to name just one federal program that has ever delivered on its promise and come in anywhere near its budget projections is good enough for me .
Maybe you can name it ?
I see .

60 years of single payer health care , third in the world in longevity .

Every other industrialized nation has a single payer system and they pay HALF per capita what we pay for healthcare , and they cover everyone .
Why ?
Because a single payer system is more efficient .
Do you also forget that a lot of these countries are smaller in population ?
And Costa Rico does not even have a military , the others get us to pay for their socialized medical care by proxy since they know we 'll defend their ass so they send less of their GNP on defense and more on infrastructure and other things like healthcare .
This one always cracks me up .
Oh @...
we can n't do it because we have too many people !
Bullshit .
Every other industrialized nation has a single payer healthcare system , and they pay HALF per capita what we pay for healthcare .
That means that if we used a single payer system , that we would actually be paying LESS for healthcare than we are paying now because a single payer system is more efficient .
Anybody heard of anyone leaving America to go to Costa Rica or Canada for a heart transplant or cancer treatment ??
wish i had a 100 bucks for every time he mentions this @.....
Sorry , but I 'm not falling for your one @-@ track pony arguments .
Your last paragraph is a reiteration of the post I responded to .
Cons do n't get that concept at all .
its going to be a HUGE undertaking to move this many people over @.....
listening to you guys your acting like one weeks tops and its done @.....
not one person including our Pres. is talking about the Scope of doing something like this , OR the problems that will be encountered to get this done @.....
but hey lets just rush into it , do it as fast as we can , and worry about the problems later @.....
meanwhile many are going to get FUCKED @....
not just that 40 million that keeps floating around @...
Many who are insured are getting fucked , by thinking they 're covered .
The insurance company screws them in the end , by refusing to pay .
True .
And it 's not like you can take your business elsewhere , not with a pre @-@ existing condition that was refused coverage by '@ executive whim @' at one of the private bureaucracies .
So much for '@ choice @' .
-@ Joe
Until he proves A caused B , he 's got nothing but proof that both A and B exist .
Perhaps you can take a stab at proving A caused B. Good luck .
Oh , yeah .
Costa Rica and its state-of-the-art medical establishment is a health care and surgical mecca for the world , dontcha know .
Sick billionaires the world over rush there to be treated , and we ALL know hospitals everywhere are clamoring to hire doctors that graduate from Costa Rican medical schools , and top doctors from every country are fighting to get jobs there @...
in American Leftist Bizarro World .
I swear , every liberal in this country must be having LSD flashbacks from the sixties , or smoking crack now , or both .
One can n't get treatment in Canada unless they have the Canadian Health Card .
I do know of people who have had dental work done in Costa Rica .
And why was it that they went all the way to Costa Rica for dental care ?
Oh , spare me .
You really want us to believe that whole cadres of people out there are getting turned down by their insurance companies for procedures clearly defined in their policies as covered , with no recourse but to suck it up ?
Prove it .
On the other hand , it is a known fact in medical billing circles that Medicare , run by our benevolent government , does not guarantee coverage for ANY service , and any service rendered to a patient on Medicare is being done totally on spec .
They MIGHT pay for it when you send in the bill , they PROBABLY will , but they do n't promise to , and they can decide not to pay and there 's nothing you can do about it .
By all means , get us all health coverage like THAT .
Pre @-@ existing conditions are n't refused coverage by "@ whim @" , you dimwit .
You do n't buy fire insurance AFTER your house burns down , or car insurance AFTER you get into a fender @-@ bender , and even you would n't be dumb enough to expect the insurance company to go along with that .
Only with health insurance are companies expected to force their other customers to cover your misfortune retroactively .
It can be done but please consider what size Costa Rico is and also , they have NO military , if we did that , we could provide healthcare , we might be speaking Chinese but we could do it I suppose .
Oh , please .
I can n't believe you people are actually accepting the absurd premise that Costa Rica actually has better health care than the United States , and arguing as though that nonsense is TRUE , and trying to find ways to explain it away , instead of just horselaughing at it and moving on as it deserves .
You dumbass liberals call me when rich people from around the world flock to Costa frigging Rica for lifesaving operations the way they do here .
And tell me which airline YOU 'D be taking there if you were diagnosed with brain cancer .
I was stating that the only way they did it was to dissolve the military , silly thing to do in this day and age .
I support a free market approach , get government completely out of the equation .
Good point .
Did n't Ted Kennedy go to Duke University in NC for his treatment ?
Now why the heck did n't he go to Costa Rica ?
I 'll patiently wait for Old Rocks or Chris to explain that .
Or even Canada
OK , not a problem ;
Two well @-@ known private hospitals , Clinica Biblica and Clinica Catolica , · where many CCSS doctors practice in the afternoons and evenings , offer · first @-@ class , ultra modern services .
Affiliated with U.S. hospitals , these two private providers , have costs · somewhat higher than the public providers , but still way below anything · found in the States .
Most Costa Rican doctors and dentists receive their · basic medical training in Costa Rica .
From here , they travel far and wide , · seeking specialized training from the finest teaching hospitals in the · world , often becoming certified in their specialties , in the countries where · they receive their advanced training .
It is not uncommon to find a Costa Rican doctor or dentist , speaking several languages , all learned , while pursuing advanced degrees in foreign countries .
Perhaps it is the CCSS work or the varied travel and study that does it , but · the caring expressed by the doctors and dentists , throughout the country , is · noteworthy in its extreme .
In 1991 , two economists from the University of Costa Rica , conducted a survey , · of visitors to this country .
Their findings , documented in the study , indicated · that 14.25 % of all visitors , came for the express purpose , of receiving medical · care of some type .
Over the years , Costa Rica has attracted those in search of uplifting cosmetic surgery .
People from around the world , arrive daily to partake of the healing · waters in over 100 thermal and mineral springs located here .
Dental work , from fillings to implants , is done routinely on people from every · corner of the world .
Many people from Latin America plan for their medical · needs from hip replacement to heart valve replacement to be taken care of · by the well @-@ trained and skillful physicians , in Costa Rica , rather than in their · native countries .
Clearly then , not only does Costa Rica offer universal health care coverage · to its citizens , but that same high quality care is available for people from · all over the world .

Let 's see , you quoted my post , yet you completely failed to answer the questions I asked .
Here they are again , try again .
Glad you brought that up !
In America the rich get the best healthcare .
Is that how healthcare should be rationed ?
Yes , only the rich deserve to have their lives saved .
Everyone else deserves to die .
Is this a great country or what ?
OK , not a problem ;
I get the best health care and I 'm not rich .
You will n't get any health care because you 're too much of a lazy parasite to buy insurance .
Who is your insurance company ?
OK , not a problem ;
Is that srsly your answer , Chris ?
It could get a bit crowded if everyone went to Costa Rica , would n't it ?
Ted Kennedy has public insurance that pays his medical bills .
No doubt he 's grateful to you for paying his medical bills .
No , actually Amanda , that is the question .
Should only the rich receive good healthcare ?
Look , up in the sky !!
It 's a bird @...
It 's a plane @...
No , it 's @........
again fuckface , I 'm not rich .
and the only reason you WILL N'T receive good healthcare is you 're too much of a shit stain to buy insurance .
Red herring and denial of actual reality , jackass .
You 're making yourself look foolish .
Do you recall in YOUR '@ The best healthcare in America is government run @' thread where you accused me of not reading the linked article then I handed you your ass with quotes FROM the article ?
I 'm sure you remember because you 've been avoiding responding to me in that thread ever since .
Here 's the thing , earlier in THAT thread I said @:
I think everyone in the world should get the very best health care .
You responded by claiming I had n't read the article .
So my question at this point is do you even read the posts you respond to ?
Your question , addressed specifically to me @: '@ Should only the rich receive good healthcare ?
' was answered in a post you supposedly read even before you asked the question .
Uh @-@ oh @....
Looks like the little lady fired up her pwnroller again !!
Amanda is simply emasculating poor little Chris today
And I for one am impressed by her ability to find anything at all to remove .
here 's one more for Amanda
Not at all .
It is the very basis of our for profit healthcare system .
How does the single mother with cancer who can n't work pay health insurance permiums ?
if they pass any bill on health care without giving Americans the time to read and digest the details , there is gonna be a revolution in this country , and I not so sure it will be a peaceful one .
1,000 people in my town showed up in the rain to protest a government run health care system today over the lunch hour .
They offered up private solutions , good ones , ones that do n't increase taxes on anyone .
The people are pissed , 1 st about the no stimulus stimulus bill that was passed before anyone had a chance to read it .
2 nd about the Omnibus bill that had 9,000 earmarks that Obama said he would veto and signed anyway .
3 rd Cap and Trade that narrowly passed the house and will be debated in the senate in Sept.
Americans are overwhelingly against these bills especially when they find out how much it is going to cost , the national debt and the absolute job killing consequences of Cap and Trade .
Seriously , should they pass national health care without an American debate I would not want to be one of them .
They will be tarred , feathered and run out of town on a rail .
A message to any democrat congressman or senator that is for national health care , make sure you have plenty of security when you show up in your home state .
It 's not going to be the warm welcome you have been used to , it 's gonna be down right ugly .
You are right .
We should abolish Medicare and the VA .
No more government healthcare .
It should be evey man for himself .
And if a single mother gets cancer and can n't pay her health insurance permium , that just too bad for her and her kids .
Now you 're thinking .
Survival of the fittest .
Kill off the weak , and shit will n't cost so much for the rest of us .
You truly are the heart and soul of the Republican Party .
or you get cancer and can n't get care because you 're too much of a shit stain to buy coverage ?
Like 99.99 % of your idiotic questions , it does n't deserve an answer for its fatally flawed premise .
Not even a good attempt to try and deflect from the fact that your entire thread premise has been eviscerated .
Should only the rich receive the best healthcare ?
Again , you daft cunt , I 'm not rich and I get great health coverage .
You never did respond to that .
2 . Changing the subject
Do only the rich deserve the best healthcare ?
did n't change the subject , you daft cunt .
I answered you .
Should you stop letting Old Rocks sodomize you ?
1 . Personal insult
Should you continue to let Old Rocks come on your face ?
1 . Personal insult
1 . Personal insult
Should you demand that Old Rocks give you a reach @-@ around ?
As I suspected you can n't answer the question .
People who can pay should get it . Pay your own bills , do n't put them one the next generation .
Odd , since I have never voted Republican in my life .
And if you are a single mother with three kids who is hospitalized with cancer , how do you "@ pay your bills @" ?
1 . Personal insult
And if you are a single mother with three kids who is hospitalized with cancer , how do you "@ pay your bills . @"
Nope , we only say that to you , shitstain .
It 's not a big story .
It 's only a big story to racist liberals .
After all , the two black boys who poured gasoline and set a 13 year old white boy on fire was n't exactly news to CNN or MSNBC . Black mobs beating up white fair goers at the Wisconsin State Fair never even got a mention .
If Fox News does n't go in for race baiting ( and it 's not even race since Zimmerman is hispanic ) , good for them .
I agree .
If the dead teen had been white this story would n't be a blip on anyones radar .
Typical race baiting .
I did see a good segment on O'Reilly yesterday on it though .
So it is getting coverage .
Hell the local news down here in Florida was full of it the other day .
Natalee Holloway disagrees with you .
So does Greta Van Susteren and FOXNEWS , who covered it ad nauseum @:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Natalee+Holloway+Greta&oq=Natalee+Holloway+Greta&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_l=youtube.3...5413l10746l0l11627l7l7l0l0l0l0l77l482l7l7l0"> Natalee Holloway Greta - YouTube </a> .
But that 's different @....
somehow .
What about the black teens who chased and beat white fairgoers in Wisconsin .
The media did n't touch this story .
This was a HUUUGE event .
For no apparent reason a group of black teenagers systematically started chasing and hitting white people .
Nothing in the media .
A group of blacks dressed in uniform and carrying clubs outside a voting precinct and the racist liberals excused it .
I would have LOVED to see what would have happened if a group of white racist dressed in Aryan militaristic garb carrying clubs outside a voting precinct would have resulted in the media @....
it would have been headline news for weeks .
Or imagine a group of white teens attacking blacks coming out of a church or other gathering @....
a nuclear bomb could go off and you would n't have known it for the wall to wall coverage .
Both the media and liberals act in overt racism on a regular basis and then we have people like MarcATL trying to point the finger the other direction .
What a tool .
All those stories were covered both in print and on television .
Yes local television .
It 's the biggest , hottest news story in media .
Are they not a media company interesting in keeping the populate updated on the latest and greatest and hottest news ?
Any of you wager to guess why such little coverage for the biggest , most powerful media organization on the world ?
Fox is covering it .
All day yesterday and today .
Because they 're not part of the State run media , they are not an extension of the Obama re @-@ election campaign .
Thus , they were n't given orders to run the same race bait story over and over to stir up racial divisions more .
Thats exactly what the Hussein wants , he wants the chaos , he wants the outrage to be rampant throughout society , and the main stream media is happy to oblige .
Killings that are INVESTIGATED are big news ( . )
not
True @..
FOX is state run media .
But it 's not part of anything Obama is doing .
The Saudis run FOX .
So , owning a 7 % share of a company means they '@ run @' Fox @....
is that your assertion ?
Seriously ?
Sometimes , swallow , you take stupid to an rdean level .
How can you not be embarrassed by that ?
Link ?
Or did you pull that out of your ass ?
Shareholders
In August 2005 the Murdoch family owned only about 29 % of the company .
However , nearly all of these shares were voting shares , and Rupert Murdoch retained effective control of the company .
Nonetheless , John Malone of Liberty Media had built up a large stake , with about half of the shares being voting shares .
Therefore , in November 2006 , News Corporation announced its intention to transfer its 38.5 per cent managing interest in DirecTV Group to John Malone 's Liberty Media ; in return it bought back Liberty 's 16.3 % shares in News Corp. , giving Murdoch tighter control of the latter firm .
[ 33 ] Murdoch sold 17.5 million class A shares in December 2007 .
[ 34 ] · Prince Alwaleed bin Talal al @-@ Saud of Saudi Arabia , through his Kingdom Holding Company , owns 7 % of News Corp. 's shares , making Kingdom Holdings the second largest shareholder .
[ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] · Years after when Elektra Records was absorbed in 2004 , News Corporation owned half of the re @-@ issues from the record label company .
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Corporation"> News Corporation - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia </a>
For the record , it is a Saudi , not '@ the Saudis @' .
I think the story is on every media outlet .
Maybe they were all at a Klan rally .
No , it was a pretty light turnout .
I was n't talking about the story .
I was simply responding to bullshit from idiots with a single fact .
'@ The Saudis @' do not '@ own @' or '@ run @' Fox News .
One Saudi owns 7 % of shares in the company .
I am bored with left wing hacks lying about this crap .
What 's really sad is the left wing crazies around here , lead by Marcatl , who are using the tragic murder of that young kid in Florida to bash Fox News .
And out and out lying about the coverage too , Sheppard Smith has been talking about it for the better part of 45 minutes , and they 've covering it all day .
You guys have absolutely no creditability at all .
It Marc was white and starting thread after thread defending Zimmerman , he 'd be called a racist .
And for good reason , in my opinion .
Marc is a racist .
Sad but true .
Oh wowza @...
Sheppard Smith talked about it for a WHOPPING ten minutes .
Big whoop !
I 'd still need to see a link to believe that tripe .
How do you know Marc is not White ?
( Oh , and for the record , I am not a roasted turkey with an eerie resemblance to Michael Richards )
He 's not , if I am to believe what he has told me in the past .
In fact , I believe he is of Caribbean descent .
He can correct me , of course .
All in all , Marc can be a dick at times and I certainly let him know when he is .
But , I do respect his passion for equal rights .
He 's OK by me .
I think a lot of folks need to reign in their emotions more and look objectively at situations , but then not everyone can be as wonderful as I am .
*@ joke @*
( And , thank goodness they are n't .
Life would be very boring for me . )
As I said , asswipe , he covered it for quite some time , I 'd say for 45 minutes at a minimum .
And the other news anchors covered it earlier in the day and you 'll see it later too .
The truth is you do n't believe it cuz you do n't wanna believe it .
And that 's fine , your entitled to whatever you wanna think .
But do n't be pretending you want a serious conversation minus any bias , cuz you can n't offer the same .
Why do n't you tune into Fox News dipshit , and see for yourself ?
Might I suggest the lead story at or near the top of every fucking hour until O'Reilly shows up ?
I 'm going to watch all the FOXNEWS shows tonight like a hawk .
From what I 've seen thus far , they 've been a day late and a dollar short .
Tepid and very light coverage when they did cover it @...
spinning it more like it 's an opportunity for the Left to grab their second amendment rights away from them .
Better you than me .
MarcATL @: taking one for the team !
Maybe they just report the facts and do n't waste time creating faux outrage without some legally sound facts to back it up ?
Maybe they do n't want to whip up hatred for the sake of ratings ?
Maybe they do n't like race baiting ?
Wipe your chin , Marc , you 're drooling again .
Ok , lay off the sauce .
This is FOXNEWS we 're talking about .
They whip up Obama hatred on a daily , sometimes hourly , basis .
Even their website stokes fear and hatred of Obama @:
Earlier , it had a story about Obama 's trip to Oklahoma this morning to announce the pipeline construction , and their headline was "@ Obama 's Pipe Dream @" .
They are just not honest actors .
Everyone knows that CalifornaGurl is the biggest , lyingest , boozing whino on the Interwebs .
You can smell the booze coming out of her pores a mile a way .
She stinks to high @-@ heaven of it .
Do n't you see how she 's always running off at the mouth spewing total nonsensical swill ?
I knew that CG was ditzy , but I did n't know she was tipsy !
Remember the two years of Obama 's Presidential Campaign ?
Well I watched FOXNEWS daily for like 14 - 16 of those months straight @...
I mean every show .
It finally got to be too much , the hatred , the race @-@ baiting , the racism , the outright lies @...
I fled and have n't turned back since .
Hannity 's the worst , he 's like the FOXNEWS version of CalifornaGurl @...
he just lies so stinkin much .
And , that 's what I mean about reigning in emotions .
You 're mad at her and you 're saying stuff that everyone knows you have no first hand knowledge of it .
Sorta cringeworthy , I say .

I just turned to The FOXNEWS in time to hear the panel discussing Obama 's birth certificate .
The Spanish TV babe was just finishing up a tirade about Obama 's birth certificate !!
No sooner did I post about it than The FOXNEWS manifest their nonsense .
That has GOT to be some kind of record .
Naw @..
no swallow for you Sandy @..
Are n't the construction workers near Piccadilly Circus enough for you ?
You still haul them two by two into the phone booths ?
Man @..
your quick .
RATINGS are important , subject matter is not .
WRONG !!!! @.....
The Five is playing right now .
Regardless , what she said stands .
A single person 's 7 % interest in an entity does not equate to it being state run .
Well , at least in this dimension .
Mad can be motivating , but being in an extended state of anger does not foster rational thought .
Thank you for the link .
But that info is from 2007 , best I can tell .
He may own more now .
Or less .
But I doubt that he would sell any .
It 's not like he needs the money .
A single share holder with 7 % of the stock @..
is pretty huge .
In any case @..
the other guy , Rupert , is in deep shit in Sandy 's native country of Britain for spying on private citizens .
Wonder how much of Murdoch 's spunk gets on her chin after he 's done ?
Wiki is easy enough to update - should the share percentage have changed , I 'm sure it would have been included .
The fact remains , you got shown to be a petty moronic whiner who clearly does not bother to fact check information .
I do .
Which is why I know that it is one Saudi , not '@ the saudis @' @...
and it is a mere 7 % - hardly a controlling interest .
So , how come you 're not accusing sallow of '@ pulling @' information '@ out of his ass @' ?
Because he 's a liberal .
Unlike myself .
I 'm a conservative , therefore you challenge my information .
You are a dishonest and mindless hack @...

Even an idiot can see the numbers do n't add up .
I despise willful stupidity .
Pathetic spinning and whining instead of using basic logic @...
you 're making yourself look ridiculous .
Even a hyper @-@ partisan dunce like yourself should realize that although normally 7 is a low number in percentage , in ownership of companies such as FOXNEWS it reflects a large percentage of influence .
From your own quote earlier , he 's the second largest shareholder .
Snap out of your partisan stupor and smell the roses .
He got FOX to scrub any references to Saudi cash backing Al Qaeda .
Heck @..
even Bush scrubbed the Saudis from the 9 / 11 commission report .
Saudis are the puppet masters of American conservatives .
And , the influence that it shows happened is that the Saudi 's request to change the description of a protest as a Muslim one to a civil one was only done after it was confirmed that it was not just Muslim .
Oh , the horror of such influence .
No he did n't .
Making more shit up .
it 's on every single last show I 've watched you lying race baiting maggot .
Which is pretty much the same as any other influential group trying to influence media @...
say , like the Color of Change organizing email campaigns to sponsors of right wing talk show hosts .
Influence @...
people have it , people use it .
I see nothing of import in that .
Of course , I 'm not an hysterical lying race baiter .
Yes , it is .
And , this thread is so very childish .
It reminds me of when I was a child and my little brother would complain that someone else 's cookie was microscopically larger than his .
We usually traded with him to stop the incessant whining about such non @-@ consequential minutia .
No , only a bit too much influence with Bush II .
The US has ignored Saudi human abuses for decades ; OIL is the reason .
Right .
Rarely are retractions made without someone telling the organization that they are wrong .
Such influence !
The horror !
They must be state run , too .
NBC is owned by GE .
GE is American .
Thus NBC is state run .
LOL !!!
Too funny !

right ?

Kid gloves for a guy who just shot someone else to death .

Who said Zimmerman is a victim ?
Other than you , of course .
Just watched Shepard Smith .
He had on an older heavy set white guy who apparently was the author of the law .
The guy who wrote it said this law does not apply .
Then Shepard went on about a young teen who bought Skittles from a 7 @-@ 11 and while unarmed , was walking back to his father while he was followed by an armed man who police told to stop following the kid .
The young teen is now dead and the killer is still walking around armed .
I know .
It was really weird to see such a thing on Fox .
Maybe because it 's coming from their token gay .
Or @....
maybe it 's because those are the established facts of this gutwrenchingly sad situation ?

I 'm watching him now .
I was watching the Al Sharpton show previously , but I 'm now back on my FOXWATCH .
Two things here @:

Too much of the the "@ fair game @" trash got a young man killed .
This one I have to disagree with you adamantly on .
What got that young man killed was racist views and a demented man with a chip on his shoulder .
That is an opinion , it is not established as fact .
The NRA heavily pushed the Stand Your Ground bill which Jeb signed .
I think Fox wants to stay on good terms w/ the NRA

That 's being independent .

However , if it was not to me , then my sincerest apologies .

How ?

right ?
yes atl .
It is not a BIG news story .
You just want to make a race case .
There are whites killed all the time in the inner city !
I watch FNC 3 @-@ 6 hours daily , an it appears to me that story is getting as much coverage as any other including that of the terrorist in France .
You , Marc , do n't know that of which you post .
Btw it 's not a white on black crime ; the shooter is Hispanic and has blacks in his immediate family .
This one is trying hard , but can n't seem to spin and twist herself out of a wet paper bag to save her partisan life .
LOL !!
Really ?
He 's a victim to you .
Who knew ?
Interesting , since you just used WIKI as a source , but just a few months ago said this about WIKI @:
Seriously , you 're citing '@ wiki @' as the absolute authority ?
You do know that it 's not a source for unbiased , strictly fact based information , right ?
I love busting you with your own words .
Not '@ busting @' at all .
I do n't rate wiki , for the reasons I cited previously @...
it is too easy to abuse the editing system .
Yet you run to wiki when it 's conveniet .
As I already stated .
However , they are right @...
it is a 7 % share .
How do you know this , if Wiki is unreliable , as you claim ?
And , I know that other people find wiki acceptable @...
so I go with it @....
"@ other people @" find MediaMatters , DailyKos and Moveon.org acceptable - do you use those , also ?

No need - I save definitive statements from wingnuts for just these situations .
Oh snap .
The Ed Show has stopped covering the Trayvon story .
He is now back to Obama ball licking .
Yet you are quick to use it when it backs up your contention , right ?
That 's dishonest .
You are ?
But you just claimed that you were a conservative .
Not "@ I am fiscally conservative @" , or "@ I have some things in common with conservatives @" - you said "@ I 'm a conservative @" .
That 's also dishonest .

Sure , go to wikipedia , that 's fine .
If you find the info there that you need , check to see if it 's cited to a separate source .

The Stand your ground law , that 's not what this case is about .

It 's written right into the law that you can n't use that law in those circumstances .

TOAST I say .
Its because their demographic thinks the shooter did the right thing .
You see , they are a bunch of morons .
Its so simple really .
I believe you 're spot on .
You can bet your bottom dollar on that .
The black dude would have been in jail the second the cops arrived on the scene .
It would have never even gotten to the point where The FOXNEWS would have had to setup their communications center there .
Excellent points Zoom .
I 'm watching that very part of MJ right now , I tape it daily so I can watch it later .
Well , looks like Black Kid Hunter Zimmerman finally got what he always wanted , a kill under his belt .
I hope he 's happy w/himself .
I 'm not seeing any justification for the title of this thread .
This story is very active on Fox .
I 'm also glad that Hannity seems to be a thorn in your side .

Twit .
Does your so-called intelligence cause you to hurl so many senseless insults there skippy ?
Since you seem to support mindless violence without the effort of due process , I view you as a race baiting asshole who cares more about creating hatred than promoting justice .
I do n't engage with mindless '@ hate @' and those who promote violence as an answer when they do n't get their way .
Child .
So far the worst of the race baiters have been unable to come up with anything that says Zimmerman shot Martin because he was black .
Not one thing .
You honestly think that did n't play into it Katz ?
Nope .
Not a single thing .
For one thing , this area is majority black .
If Zimmerman was going to target blacks , he 'd be doing it every day all day .
If he was a racist , he would n't be living there in the first place .
There would be a long history of expressed racism .
There is n't .
The only act that the race baiters have is that Treyvon Williams is black .
George Zimmerman is hispanic , but BUT for purposes of accusation he 's white .
The area is majority black ?
I read somewhere it was like a little over 30 % black , does anyone have a link for this ?
Fox can n't find a way to blame ACORN .
Once they discover that smoking gun , they 'll be on it .
The beady eyed one is a good lister .
The homosapien , barely , has a knack for listing off things that bash Obama and his Administration .
I 'm sure the lapdogs and lemmings just lick it up , off the ground and all .
He just prattled off a list of things / people that Obama blames for the gas prices .
I 've seen him do lists of all sorts of things like this .
What a putz .
He must be doing something right @...
#1 , he 's pissing you off and #2 , he 's doing a lot better that Rachel madcow in the ratings .
So I guess you 're double pissed .
He 's doing a lot worse in influence , and he 's a total failure in facts .
How , precisely , does '@ everyone know that @' ?
You create your own reality if that makes your life easier .
I shall remain in the real one , where I cope exceptionally well .
This is the wrong thread for this .
But what I do n't understand is how you can have such a strong opinion and know nothing ?
Look , do a search using the phrase , "@ Prince Alwaleed bin Talal protects Murdoch against hostile takeover bids @" and then pick which source you want to "@ learn from @" , because deary , you really need to learn .
Rupert Murdoch only owns 30 % of News Corp. A hostile bid is a lot easier going against 30 % then 37 % .
And while you 're at it , find out why Rupert is investing in the Prince 's middle eastern network .
I love that you sign all of your posts !
It gives them that '@ personal touch @' .
He only called him a "@ fucking coon @" on the 911 call , but that 's not racial , is it ?
I see that I just walked in on a Mensa Society meeting .
You and the other race @-@ baiters are trying to prove that with Fox not covering Trayvon ( they are though ) , its viewers must be racist .
The problem is , Fox has been covering the story and even the LW mouthpiece MSNBC has been covering other stories .
You see , their viewers do not want the network to get off the "@ bash the Repubs and kiss Obama 's ass @" format .
How 's that for giving a damn about this kid ?
Your statment , "@ Its because their demographic thinks the shooter did the right thing @" is total bullshit as evidenced by the majority of the thousands of postings on this matter .
All but the most EFF'd up people , regardless of ideology , feel that this was a bad shooting and Zimmerman must pay for what he did .
There are many facts that have not come out yet and due process must be allowed to play out .
Yeah , and on fox on Hannity , this fucking idiot said perhaps the shooting was an accident .
Seriously , he fucking said this .
The other mensa members at fox and friends said he was killed because he was wearing a hoodie , so its his fault .
Fucking fox and fox fans are beyond belief .
They really are and I am speaking to you directly .
Academically minded ?
Really ?
You sit in front of one of mankind 's greatest inventions .
A method to find out information from anywhere in the world in seconds .
From millions of different sources .
With pictures and video .
Yet , you call what you learn "@ fiction @" and feel it 's "@ stupid @" .
Yet , there you are , pounding out nothing of value .
But I get it .
I really do .
In the "@ binary @" world of the right wing , it 's either ALL lies or ALL gospel truth .
There is no in @-@ between .
But there is "@ outside the box @" , which is where you are .
We call that space "@ batshit crazy @" .
I keep telling you not to read those prophecy sites rdean , you are getting confused .
I just learned that today was the first day Obama said anything about the Trayvon Martin story .
Today .
Interesting .
And Fox News is covering this story .
They 're just not in a Race @-@ Baiting feeding frenzy like the Liberal Press is .
They 're actually being responsible journalists .
As more evidence comes out , they will cover the story a bit more .
Then why did HANNITY say the shooting was an accident ?
Why did fox and friends say it was the victims fault because he wore a hoodie ?
Please explain this ?
I actually listened to Hannity 's radio show today and he said nothing of the sort .
In fact he is all for getting to the bottom of this as quickly as possible @...
your assertion that Hannity is soft on this is WAY OFF Bud @...
way off .
Either you 're a liar , ignorant of recent history , willfully ignorant , or a pathetic combination of all three .
EVERY situation that you mention was covered by the press ( TV , radio , print ) @....
a simple google search will confirm what I say .
What you did n't have in those cases were a police force that did a piss poor job of investigating a fatal shooting and a Jeb Bush local law that gave creeps like Zimmerman ( with a record of being a 911 nusiance to the police AND a criminal record ) credence to do what he did .
And then you had this <a href="http://current.com/shows/the-young-turks/videos/in-911-call-does-george-zimmerman-call-trayvon-martin-a-fing-coon"> In 911 call , does George Zimmerman call Trayvon Martin a '@ f***ing coon @' ? </a>

Fox Noise resident idiot Hannity try to play it all off as a "@ mistake @" @......
yeah , after the 911 tape clearly has the cops telling Zimmerman that he does not have to follow Martin , and Zimmerman making all types of wild assumptions while observing a man in the rain at night !
So "@ hispanics @" do not racially discriminate ?
Puh @-@ leeze !
Fox and Friends said that ?
Really ?
That was Geraldo Rivera , who , I am pretty sure , is a complete idiot , and a liberal .
the TWO self professed new black panthers that stood outside a polling station were investigated by the cops and it was found that they did NOT threaten or intimidate anyone nor did they belong to any true organization .
Had neo @-@ nazis / aryans showed up in a GROUP as you say , then that would have made news because those boys make it known they do n't like black folk .
The pseudo @-@ panthers claimed they were there to prevent a re @-@ enactment of the nonsense that went on in Florida in 2000 .
And all one has to do is a simple google search to see that the Wisconsin incident was covered by TV , radio and print .
So either YOU are poor liar or incredibly ignorant as to what 's going on around you .
What you had in Florida with Zimmerman was a 911 tape like this <a href="http://current.com/shows/the-young-turks/videos/in-911-call-does-george-zimmerman-call-trayvon-martin-a-fing-coon"> In 911 call , does George Zimmerman call Trayvon Martin a '@ f***ing coon @' ? </a>
A guy with a criminal record being told by the cops he does n't have to follow the man , cops who do a piss poor job of crime scene investigation , the parents trying for 3 days to find out what happened to their kid , and a law that encourages assholes like Zimmerman .
It 's a perfect storm that subliminal sheet wearers like YOU do n't like .
TFB .
Facts are not important

in sufficient detail as is available .
The hysterical bullshit and speculation that you indulge in has no place in a '@ news @' program .
Now , try and use the limited intellect you possess to think logically and dispassionately - without regard to the victim 's race about how much solid factually accurate information there is about this case @...

Do n't worry , BSNBC is pimping the story like a cheap whore
Maybe it 's because FOX has the good sense to not go all half cocked before anyone knows what the facts are .
Who in the media 's been going "@ half @-@ cocked @" and how did they do it ?
Every single person who is assuming Zimmerman should be in jail just because the kid he shot was black .
Come to think of it , that would include you , which might explain why you do n't see it .
The police report indicated that Zimmerman had a cut on his head , the girlfriend said she heard some type of struggle over the phone before the shots , and there is even a witness that claims he saw that fight .
All of that proves that Zimmerman told the police the truth .
What the police have to find out now is if Zimmerman instigated the confrontation .
If he did , he should face charges .
If he was just following him to make sure he did n't break into a house somewhere in the neighborhood , and Martin actually initiated , and escalated , the confrontation , he should n't .
Until I know the facts I will n't make a decision .
The "@ fight @" was a result of Zimmerman PURPOSEFULLY CONFRONTING MARTIN WITH HIS PREJUDICE IDEALS @....
IDEALS RECORDED ON THE 911 TAPE .
WTF are YOU babbling about ?
Do you truly understand who created the term "@ hispanic @" and what it entails , you libertarian lunkhead ?
And as the 911 tapes shows , it was n't "@ liberals @" that brought race into the issue , but Zimmerman himself !
Get your head out of Ron Paul 's ass , will ya please .
Racist .
Just as I thought @....
another libertarian lunkhead parroting the neocon / teabagger rhetoric @...
and when confronted , you got NOTHING ( here 's where this libertarian lunkhead excerpts part of my response in an "@ I know you are , but what am I @" retort ) .
Why do you hate America so much ?
In America we have a thing called Due Process .
We do not approve of Lynch @-@ Mobs .
I know that bothers you Socialists / Progressives , but that 's the way it is .
So get over it .
The more it looks like Zimmerman acted in self defense , the less you will hear of this case .
Nah , you 're just an average bigot .
I can spot em a mile away .
Are you just being a stupid crank with this neocon / teabagger BS ?
Or are you truly just another libertarian lunkhead parroting your neocon / teabagger cousin 's stupidity ?
Hey genius , "@ due process @" includes PROPER POLICE PROCEDURE @....
that means you DO NOT just let a man involved in a fatal shooting go scott free without so much as taking them to a precinct for questioning , drug / alcohol test .
The call for justice is a call for Zimmerman to be arrested , not "@ lynched @" .
Intellectually dishonest libertarians / neocons / teabaggers are quick to distort and misrepresent anything that does not fit into your warped version of life @....
but the FACTS will always be your undoing .
Carry on .
Candy Crowley on CNN , their chief political correspondent , this AM asked Gov Scott of Florida why it "@ took more than a month to react ? @"
Today is Sunday the 25 th of March and the shooting took place on Sunday February 26 th .
That 's 28 days ago which is now exactly a month ago , and the Gov appointed a special prosecutor and a task force to investigate on the 22 nd .
So why was n't she able to report this factually , and based on that why should we believe her reporting ?
Those idiots can only think of one answer to the question because anything else would spoinl their attempt to make this a race issue .
The reason that it took so long is that the Sanford Police investigated the incident and determined that Zimmerman 's story checked out and they released him .
That should have been it but the parents of the boy were n't satisfied and then ONLY because Treyvon is black and they thought Zimmerman was white , did it become a major story .
Now that it is , Gov. Scott is placating the hysterical lynch mob by having someone look into it .
the fact that after all that , Zimmerman is still a free man today makes me suspect that Zimmerman 's story still checks out .
Mind you , it is only speculation on my part .
Please stop treating your supposition and conjecture as fact .
It took the PARENT of Martin 3 days before they got the word from the local police dept. as to what happened to their missing kid .
Zimmerman was NEVER taken down to a precinct for an OFFICIAL questioning DESPITE being involved in a fatal shooting .
He still has n't to this day .
No decent foresnics .
WTF is that all about ?
If it were NOT for the due diligence of local black media ( and then national black media ) along with Progressive radio stations , the Main Stream Media would have kept this story on the back burner @....
hell , Fox News was STILL the last one to catch on with coverage AFTER the Big 3 started coverage .
Gov. Scott is involved because of the PRESSURE brought by the various groups and the ( now ) national media examination .
Try dealing with the FACTS instead of your wishful thinking .
Zimmerman was taken into custody , and released after the police determined they had no probable cause .
As for the forensics , do you think the world works like CSI ?
Most of the crap they show is impossible half the rest is junk science , and half of the real stuff they show will n't hold up in court .
Most police departments can n't do a fraction of the forensics that actually exists , so the police screwing it up is not part of some massive conspiracy .
Why do n't you start dealing with the facts before you try lecturing others .
The only person in this process whose due process rights are a concern are George Zimmerman 's , are you trying to argue the police are railroading him ?
If not , stop talking about due process .
You do n't believe in Due Process ?
Man , you Socialists / Progressives really are lost .
Maybe America is n't the place for you ?
May i suggest China or North Korea ?
Bon Voyage .
Due Process begins with proper police procedure , you stupe .
As it 's evident , the cops in that area did n't even do that !
A matter of history , a matter of fact that @...
which now requires scrutiny by other forces ( state and possibly federal ) .
But do continue to babble like a good little neocon / teabagger / libertarian flunkie @....
it would be funny if it were n't so pathetic .
You 're dumb .
Seriously , it 's true .
Really ?
Prove it !
Because to date he was NOT given a blood alcohol test , foresnics as to the ballistics from his gun , nor was the 911 tape brought into question as to WHY did he pursue and confront Martin when he told not to .
So beyond a quick Q&A , what the hell happened ?
Was his gun even confiscated ?
( and how the hell does a guy with a record get a CCWP ? )
Who said anything about the CSI program , genius .
Standard ballistic test to determine powder residue on victims and perps hands has been around for a LONG time , and is available to even the most remote precinct / station .
If they do n't have it on the premises , they can send it to a regional one that does @.....
and remember , it 's was OVER A MONTH before the "@ main stream media @" picked this up , which is MORE than enough time for proper police work to have taken place .
Why do n't you start thinking beyond the talking points that make you feel good ?
Aw , Liberal cretins are just pissed because Zimmerman is actually Hispanic .
It kinda throws a wrench in their '@ Evil Whitey kills Black Kid @' Race @-@ Baiting hysteria .
Liberal Media Outlets like CNN & NBC are absolutely befuddled as to how to proceed .
First they called him '@ White @' and indicted the entire White Race .
But now they 're backpedaling and have become distraught .
The Liberal Media is a joke .
Period , end of story .
I am babbling about the facts , something that is strange to you .
Sorry , but your history on these threads demonstrate time and again what a quantum neocon gasbag you are .
let 's see if you can do better here .
The tape did not record his ideals , he did n't enunciate them to the operator .
I have listened to the tapes , and the only slur it is possible to get out of the tape is ambiguous .
Even if he said it , and was actually referring to Martin , it does n't say anything about Zimmerman 's ideals , it might .
however , be indicative of state of mind .
Are you fucking stupid or just insipidly stubborn ?
Here gasbag , BS & deny this @:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgR7gCxXQYg"> ACTUAL UNCUT AUDIO !!! </a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgR7gCxXQYg"> George Zimmerman 's Trayvon Martin 911 - YouTube </a>
Zimmerman makes all types of assumptions that DO N'T coincide with additional information .
Given his history of calls on "@ suspicious @" black males that DID NOT PAN OUT , his state of mind is pretty evident @....
and he DID NOT have to pursue Martin .
What matters is who started the fight , not why it started .
If Martin turned around and called Zimmerman a honky and Zimmerman attacked him Zimmerman over reacted .
If Martin attacked Zimmerman because he was being followed , he over reacted .
Simple statements of fact ,
You 're simple if you think your supposition and conjecture will pass the muster .
Zimmerman INITIATED THE CONFRONTATION , as the tape clearly tells that he PURSUED Martin when it was NOT necessary or prompted by the cops .
Referring to Martin as an "@ asshole @" and a "@ fucking ( coon ? ) @"
along with his generalize assumptions gives a clear indication of his mindset , whether YOU like it or not .
Are you really this fucking dense or are you just being obstinate ?
Due process means exactly that @.....
the process of investingation before any charges are actually being done .
You shoot someone in a public area when there is serious question as to motive and cause , you should be arrested and taken in for questioning , drug testing , foresnics , etc.
Deal with it .
Thanks for proving my point , Pauly .
Have the last word , if it makes you feel better .
You 're dismissed !
Ok .
You 're also an angry bigot .
See ya .
Pauly is STILL babbling in his ignorance regarding the true origin and definition of the word "@ hispanic @" .
Zimmerman 's own history of calls to the cops and the following set his mindset regarding racial prejudice
Pauly is just another stupid libertarian / neocon / teabagger crank .
Ignore him .
My brother , I implore you , do not engage with circus barkers @...

They are to be laughed at or pitied from afar , but certainly not fed .

Hey the FOXNEWS watchers and defenders .
Have the FOXNEWS covered the latest news in the case @...
the video which shows that the killer , George Zimmerman does n't appear to have a scratch or at least not anything indicating being hurt directly after being arrested ?
Did any of their actual news anchors covered it ?
How about their pundits ?
Anyone @...@ ?
They covered that this morning .
sorry ya racist fuck , but FOX has covered it on every single last show , that I have seen .
Pity you suck so fucking much that honesty can n't seep in .
But you keep praying for Zimmerman to get killed .
I 'm sure Satan answers prayers as well .
They did n't cover it yesterday .
So they were an entire day late in a BIG news story .
That is equivalent to like a week in the news business .
And they 're supposed to be the number one news network .
Why is that ?
Could it be that they were waiting to get their talking points and marching orders sorted out ?
Hmmmmm @.....@ ?
So what did they say anyway ?
I 'm curious to know .
Racist Black Panther wannabe post .
Nothing more , nothing less .
Your claims are completely inacurate .
I know that from simple observation .
I saw about an hour total on it on FNC yesterday , and there wre various invterviews including the lawyer ( s ) for the family of the victim
OK , fair enough .
What were they saying about it ?
Finish your statement / report .
They showed the video just like all the other news did yesterday and then said that the video was to grainy to make any judgment and people should wait until the medical reports about it come out .
Ahhh @....
Yes , they 've got their talking point sorted out .
Pretty much all the RWers were repeating that meme yesterday @....
"@ it 's too grainy , so we should wait . @"
Of course they want to wait , that video is damning .

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neGbKHyGuHU"> "@ Security @" patrols stationed at polling places in Philly - YouTube </a>
There 's still yapping and squeeling on and on and on about two anonymous black dudes with a stick playing dress up .
As if it 's supposed to be some big deal .
White racist MFers walking around brandishing armed guns @....
no big deal .
These racist RWers never cease to amaze me .
Racist .
It was on fox news Sunday .
However it 's a non story other than for political opportunists .
I think the "@ bigger @" story is , how many "@ leaders @" that are for "@ racial equality @" are demanding a lynching .
I guess its okay if you are on the '@ right @' side of the rope ?
Why is this the biggest news story ?
Of course Bill Kristol thinks that it 's much to do about nothing .
So he bashes the coverage .
He does n't get it .
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/01/bill-kristol-trayvon-martin-media-coverage_n_1394815.html"> Bill Kristol @: Trayvon Martin Media Coverage Is '@ Demagoguery @' ( VIDEO ) </a>
Although this guy does @...
Kristol is partially correct , although probably not in the way he thinks .
The thing about this case that has turned it into such a big story is that it is something different to everyone .
To some it about racial profiling .
To some it is police sweeping it under the rug .
To some it is about the SYG law .
To some it is about concealed carry .
And the list goes on .
Some see it merely as a crime .
Those on the right who hold different views do n't have just one view either .
Take what Scarborough said just the other day .
He claimed it was NOT about SYG . Kristol says the opposite .
What first made this a national case was that the police were not adequately investigating and were openly defending Zimmerman .
The injustice of that drew everyone in . Kristol gets that part right @..
Where he goes wrong is in his assessment of the continued coverage .
It is far more complex than what he tries to claim .
Part of the continued attention is countering the kneejerk claims of people who defended Zimmerman .
For example , the faIse photos of Martin became an entire subset of stories .
The police station video became a big story because it countered all of the claims of Zimmerman being severeIy beaten .
Another aspect of the continued coverage is due to the genuine puzzlement that Zimmerman still remains uncharged in a situation where most people would have been charged .
The slow trickling of information is another aspect that keeps this going .
It took weeks to get the 911 calls and even longer to get the police station video .
Various other information , such as police reports , came out at other times .
Much of the information was due to independent investigation ( that the police should have done ) and thus came out as soon as it was available .
All of this plays into the 24 hour news cycle .
So , what we have is an emotional case that means something different to everyone , and a situation ( brought on mostly by the police ) where information is discovered in a way that perpetuates the story .
Wow I do n't watch FoxNews all day , but I turned it there and they had the story on .
Look just because Fox NEws does n't bend over for democrats and Obama does n't mean they are anywhere as right as the main media is left .
Stop with the talking points .
Instead of bashing FoxNews , who does n't edit 911 tape to change the story , light rockets under gas tanks to get trucks to explode , tout false documents as real , hire just democrats , fire john stossel just because he was n't a liberal anymore .
I could go on , but I think you get the point , those are some of the things off the top of my head that our "@ objective @" media have done , funny how none of those "@ errors @" favor the right , hmmmmmm
No it 's you who does not get it .
Trayvon 's father does n't deserve any blame at all .
Why did n't Trayvon call his father and say "@ get out here and take this yahoo off my ass @" instead of calling his girlfriend .
Who knows ?
thats a good question but the boy is dead now .
Which is a real shame that this family has had their son taken from them .
What I find troubling is that acting thug is a survival instinct in the "@ hood @" .
Many kids who are n't at all thugs feel that they have to at least act like one to survive .
There is a chance that non @-@ thug Trayvon went street rat on a man he assumed to be unarmed .
Maybe it worked in the past .
In states that have these kinds of stand your ground laws , it is best to assume that everyone is armed and willing to use a weapon in the event of a threat .
When "@ hello @" becomes "@ declare your intent @" we will be well on our way to sanity , just as it was in the very beginning when all men had swords and bows .
Well acting like a "@ thug @" is not just something you see in the hood anymore , thanks to the world wide spread of hip hop culture you see people acting like that everywhere , I have seen white kids in Iowa wearing doo rags and sagging their pants , believe it or not I have seen Arab teenagers acting like this in Kuwait and using the word "@ nigga @" to each other , this is hardly specific for just Blacks anymore , keep in mind people will n't act the way they were as teenagers for ever , when I was 17 I listened to hip hop , I had braids in my junior year of high school , I had a 15 year old girlfriend with a 1 year old baby , and I went by the nick name "@ Lil Al Capone @" , why do you ask ?
Al Capone was my hero as a teen and I looked up to him , now fast forward 13 years later , I did 7 years in the US Military , was deployed twice to the Middle East , and I now have a good job working the government as a Civilian , I have a clean arrest sheet , I was only arrested once for punching a guy in the face who tried to go behind the bar and attack the female bartender , once the police reviewed the rapes I was released with no charge .
The life I am living now is completely different than the one I had at 17 .
Why was Trayvons body laying 12 hours in the Morgue ?
Why did n't his father report him missing before he did ?
Where was Trayvons Father when Trayvon needed him the most less than 1000 feet away .
These are all questions that the Sanford PD will have to answer and account for .
There 's no excuse why they bungled this up so horribly .
I know of only one reason how this could have happened .
Marc why was Trayvon 's body not claimed from the morgue until 12 hours after his death ?
Why did n't the father at least look out his window when all the shouting was taking place ?
Where was the father when the shot was fired not more than a 1000 feet away ?
The distance is my guesstamation but the fight was n't far from where Trayvon 's father lived .
That is something news worthy .
Title of the news story · Where was Trayvon 's Father when his son needed him the most ?
how is this relevant ?
Do n't blame the father .
Fuck you and fuck marc race baiting son of a bitch .
Where the fuck was the father who sons less than 1000 feet away was dying ?
Why did it take the father so long to report his son was missing ?
After all his son had been suspended for 10 days from school .
Marc seems to this there should be more news reporting about Trayvon do n't bitch about it when someone ask these questions because the longer this goes with media attention the more Trayvon will not look like an angel but a child who did not have any parental guidance
Not only are you coming apart at the seams and falling off the deep end , but you 're showing how openly racist you are .
Again , good luck with that blaming @-@ the @-@ father @-@ of @-@ the @-@ murdered @-@ victim path that you 're on .
Carry on .
Why is CNN grinding away at Zimmerman ?
They are clearly pushing an agenda .
Why is the Zimmerman defense team grinding away at the deceased victim , Trayvon Martin , unleashing a smear campaign the likes that have never before been seen this century ?
W know , because for those who have followed the story , the father was out to dinner with his fiance .
When they arrived , they used the front entrance , and would n't have even seen any aftermath hours later ( if there were any ) in the common backyard .
He very likely just assumed his child was in bed , sleeping .
The very next morning was when he called in a missing persons report .
The idiot bigfatrebel is still blowing copious amounts of shit out of his ass .
His father may have called friends , etc. I have not read his father waited 12 hours to call the police in any case .
[quote=paperview;5056446]
Thank you , Paper
You 're welcome .
For those who need to see how the layout was , and where Trayvon 's fiance 's house was in relation to the shooting , here @:
Trayvon being in the morgue for 12 hours is not the fault of Sanford PD . Trayvon did not have an ID .
So why did n't the father call the PD and report his son was missing ?
Did he allow Trayvon to stay out as long as Trayvon wanted too ?
More media attention , and more media , period .
More TV channels , internet , mobile phones , etc. etc.
Since I do n't pay any attention to Beck , I have no idea who he supports or why . Nor do I care .
What I can tell you , hand on heart @....
Hell will freeze over before I 'd vote for Gingrich .
Romney , I could grit my teeth , hold my nose , and vote for - purely for his economic experience .
We need smart businessmen , not career politicians .
I 'll vote for almost anyone over Obama .
All of the Repugs would be an improvement over Barrack Obama @.....
including Ron Paul .
Btw , Newt has n't been a politician for almost a couple of decades @......
so he 's not a career politician anymore .
However , when he was he 's the only one I can remember that actually got things done .
After all , he is responsible for balancing the budget and actually giving us a surplus .
When it comes to Romney , he 's a businessman but he would have been a Senator if he could have beat Kennedy .
Newt pointed that fact out the other day .
What we need is new ideas and someone who can n't be bought .
I do n't give a shit whether they used to be a politician or not .
and there you have idiots pretending Im not right because they can not face the real truth .
You think your all clever because you can insult .
You were the ones who picked the worst president in history .
Your opinions are pretty meaningless to anyone who cares about real facts .
In what way did I insult you ?
Yesterday Glenn Beck spent the entire program talking about how progressive Newt Gingrich was .
The way he was talking about him it was like he was actually Barrack Obama .
Beck almost sounded like he has lost his mind .
Glenn Beck supports Christian fundamentalists like Michelle Bachmann and Rick Santorum .
He feels that Bachmann is his choice for President .
Beck does n't think that now is the time to compromise on our principles .
Well , from what I can see , religion is the number one principle that Glenn Beck needs from his candidate .
If any of you do n't know , Glenn Beck is a Mormon , or more accurately a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , or LDS . I am currently an inactive member of this same church .
I have some disagreements with the church .
Some would say it is a cult .
Harry Reid and Mitt Romney are two prominent members btw . From what I 've seen it is a cult , a cult that Beck is a member of .
He is a prime example of why Barrack Obama is currently our President .
Folks that refused to accept anything other than their idea of a perfect candidate .
Someone who has all of the right beliefs and says all of the right things .
I 've talked to these types .
The type of Christian that does n't like anyone of other faiths .
Christians that have forgotten the teachings of Christ or never learned them .
Love thy brother as you would love yourself @...
regardless of his beliefs or his race .
Glenn Beck does n't support Newt because he thinks his immigration policies are too progressive .
He accuses Newt of being too progressive when it comes to health care .
He 's also another one of these nut cases that mistook what Newt said about Paul Ryan 's plan claiming he actually wants GOP social @-@ engineering , which is far from the truth .
Newt merely said he would not exchange Democrat social @-@ engineering for Republican social @-@ engineering .
Glenn Beck has already made up his mind .
He supports Bachmann , and he supports Santorum , but now he even says he 'd rather vote for Ron Paul over Newt Gingrich .
This is insane .
Glenn Beck would rather lose another Presidential election then compromise on his crazy principles .
After listening to him yesterday I got the impression that Beck is slowly losing his fricken mind .
The way he was talking about Gingrich it sounded like he was describing one of the most evil politicians ever to walk the face of the Earth .
I believe Beck does n't understand the way Newt thinks .
He 's totally misinterpreting his beliefs and thus doing a disservice to his candidacy and doing his best to usher in another 4 years of Barrack Obama .
I do n't think Beck really cares right now if this happens and that he may be one of the primary reasons it does .
I 'm not gonna voice my thoughts on what exactly is causing Glenn Beck to be so vocal about Newt or George W. Bush in the past .
However I can say that it seems like he 's doing more damage to his own professed cause than good .

We should care what Glenn Beck and Dick Cheney think at this point ?
The GOP seems to be grasping at straws these days not to mention the value they place on irrelevant commentary from both of them .
the country is getting tired of you manufactured war between the American people
OMGorsh
Coming from an Obama supporter I find that extremely hilarious .
Yet whenever a thread about glennbeck pops up you 're all over it like a hobo on a ham sandwich .
Your party has been found out .
Your bullshit of hating on half of the American people is getting your failed party no where .
That is why no decent republican candidate ( the very few there are ) would run this go arround .
The GOP can suck my sack .
I do n't care what they want .
They sold us down the river when they pitched in with the Dems and took our Social Security and used it to run up the debt .
I support workable solutions rather than ideologies .
I 'm willing to overlook a lot just to get Obama out of there .
Anybody would give this government legitimacy again .
Right now we 're a world @-@ wide laughing @-@ stock .
Course no decent candidate ever runs as a Democrat these days as well .
Hmmmm @...
I LIKE Glenn Beck .
I had always thought he was one of the better looking men in broadcasting @...
I do NOT always agree with what he says or his angles , but he seems to break things down on his show in such a way that the least informed can potentially better understand @...
There are times he 's been laughable @...
but it is so with most any politically based show , I suppose .
Even the Washington Journal has some callers @....
So that was n't you posting in the other Beck thread yesterday ?
Every time the GOP has to pick a candidate to run for POTUS we see the same thing happening .
They use the same sleazy character assassinating techniqes on their fellow Republicans that they use against the Dems .
Really , folks , the GOP is a party with a servere character disordered problem in that respect .
Remember when the big lies propagandists turned on one of their own who also happened to be a US Military triple amputee to accuse HIM of being a terrorist sympathizer ?
I mean seriously @...
how vile is THAT ?
The GOP is the party of character asssassination , big lies and big propaganda .
The Dems have their own underhanded techiques for internacine wars , of course , but the GOP really has the emotional and ethical IQs of a school yeard filled with 8 year bullies .
Ravi , honey , I criticized the media spin on his words .
That does n't mean I agree with him , or know who he does or does not support .
Really ?
So you did n't even comprehend that he was against Newt .
That 's pretty amazing for someone that prances around and calls other people stupid , ignorant , and unable to comprehend the written word .
I was not overly interested in who he was criticizing .
That 's of no interest to me .
What fascinates me is the ability of seemingly logical people to fall for any old bullshit that the media put out .
Truth comes second to point scoring with some people @....
not with me .
The right will defend anything to cling to their historically failed ideas .
Newt is a progressive .
He has said as much himself .
You also left out Rush , Hannity and Lavin .
This is also a primary not a general election .
This is the part where all the candidates get trashed .
Are all the talkers supposed to love thees guys up or air out there dirty laundry ?
As for the Mormon crap , Beck and the others are not thrilled about Romney .
I fail to see the conspiracy .
I did n't imply any kind of conspiracy .
I simply said Beck is one of those unbending Christians that will be the Bain of the GOP .
As far as Newt is concerned , I do n't believe he 's a Progressive .
That 's just another attempt to trash his ideas .
He 's as much a Progressive as Mitt Romney or Jesus Christ .
Let 's just say he 's more open @-@ minded than your average Republican .
He 's also not for bigger government , but more effective government .
This is just an attempt by the fringe elements on both sides to knock off another Republican front @-@ runner .
Why on earth would Glenn shut up ?
He does n't want us to come to a choose between Newt and Obama .
Two big government progressives .
And we have plenty of time to avoid that "@ choice @" so he is reminding everyone who Newt is and what the Tea Party stands for .
We want to change Washingon , so we are going to send in the biggest Washington insider campaigning ?
We want to close the border by supportng someone who does n't ?
We want to get government out of our lives by supporting someone who has supported the expansion of this government ?
We want to restore the Constitution by supportng someone who has voted contrary to it when convenient ?
The only thing going for Newt is that balanced budget during the Clinton administration .
He 's smart and he 's a good talker .
But you know what , there is something more important than talking big .
What 's the point of being smart if your working for things that are n't good ?
I want to see this nation change for the better .
I want to see this government shrink .
Honestly , I do n't know if any of the candidates will actually do that .
But of all of them , Newt is the one that has grown it the most .
He go 's after Romney as much as Newt .
And Newt has called himself a progressive .
I agree that Beck puts to much religion into his politics , but as far as bashing the GOP candidates he is no worse then the other GOP water boys on the radio .
After the primary they will all rally around the one who wins .
This morning I was watching "@ Good Day New York @" on Channel 5 , which is part of the FOX network .
The co @-@ host were interviewing a guy who is part of the on @-@ going occupation of Wall St. , and were ( of course ) repeating the media standard line by questioning the man as to why there is no set goals or leadership to advocate such goals .
During his response , the man pointed out that it 's about all types of people pointing out that nothing is being done about the economic inequality and subsequent crimes perpetrated by Wall St. / banking giants ( individuals and corporations ) @....
and that you had leaders from various backgrounds join in . He stated that Al Sharpton "@ a self made man from the streets like me @" was joining @.....
at which time co @-@ host Greg Kelly interjected ( twice ) that like Al Sharpton , Rupert Murdoch is a self made man .
Come again ?
Rupert Murdoch INHERITED HIS FATHER 'S OWNERSHIP OF TWO NEWSPAPERS IN THE U.K. ( Australia ) .
He did NOT start out in the copy room of some local city paper and work his way up to mogul .
Al Sharpton grew up doing the preacher circuit for his particular brand of religion .
Big difference .
I saw this as just another Fox flunkie pushing the "@ class warfare @" line that 's heard from the neocon / teabagger pundits in the media .
By trying to equate Murdoch as a successful "@ every man @" , co @-@ host Greg Kelly pushes the subliminal context that the Wall St. protesters are just "@ jealous @" of "@ successful people @" .
Typical Fox BS @....
but not unexpected .
anyone comparing al sharkskin to anything other than an elocutionary murderer on a scale comparable with hitler and all around steaming pile of
should have their head examined , so yea , Fox blew it .
great catch
Unfortunately Class Envy / Class Warfare works .
The Democrats are turning American against American .
It 's an awful '@ Divide & Conquer @' strategy .
Look for them to ratchet this stuff up much more as the Election draws nearer .
Anything to hold on to power i guess .
It 's very sad .
Laughable to say the least .
The right brays on and on about Unions , Public employee benefits , the Poor not paying income tax , people on welfare and food stamps and people on SSI .
Then @..
when anything is mentioned about the outrageous behavior of the the top tier in this country @..
it 's class warfare .
Amazing .
no not really , whats laughable is the overabundance of shallowness you possess as opposed to any scintilla of critical thinking @....
Anyone who would compare Sharpton to Hitler is just well a moron and a major pile of shit .
Do n't hate your fellow Americans .
Being a success is a good thing .
Do n't be jealous and bitter .
That only leads to hate and violence .
God has a plan for us all .
Stay true to him and he will stay true to you .
Some Politicians are now just preying on human weakness .
They are promoting this Class Envy / Class Warfare stuff to get and hang onto power .
It 's not healthy for our nation .
Turning American against American is just wrong .
A house divided will surely fall .
You say do n't hate your fellow Americans but have no problem supporting people who go after union workers , and the so called "@ moochers @" .
And Fox is right up there promoting class warfare , running a story on makers and moochers is a prime example of that .
So please take your hypocritical bullshit somewhere else .
Fox News covers various angles of all issues .
You chose only that one angle to focus on .
But that 's ok with me .
That 's how you feel .
I was just saying how wrong it is for Politicians to promote such jealousy & bitterness towards fellow Americans .
It is a deliberate '@ Divide & Conquer @' agenda .
We do n't need to turn on each other .
That 's not the right way to go .
Hating a fellow American because he or she is more successful than you will only lead to more hate & violence in this country .
I really do hope more Americans turn to God in the future .
God Bless and have a good day .
you are incapable of comprehension it appears , its not hard , try reading what I said slowly , maybe 3 times , you 'll get it .
Hating Americans because they are not as successful as you also leads to more hate .
Telling them it is their own fault they are not rich ( you buddy Cain ) is just as much class warfare as anything that has been said by the OWS .
Comparing people who make more , and pay more taxes to the middle class and lower middle class , and calling them makers and takers is class warfare .
Yeah , I got what you are saying .
You are still a pile .
crisis averted then @....
Hate to point out the obvious ( I lie ) but when Murdoch inherited those tow papers in Australia he had been working as an editor for a different paper in another country .
He then built those tow papers into a media empire that makes idiots like you froth at the mouth .
If that is not a self made man I have never heard of one .
Well them you , squire , have never heard of one .
SLAP OUT OF IT !!!
He took two small papers with declining circulation in a small city in South Australia and built a media empire and made himself on of the wealthiest men in the world .
Explain to me , in detail , and using the small words you can understand , how that is not an example of a self made man .
The ows are just a bunch of spoiled kids that want great pay w/o the education or effort it takes to get it .
None of them are taking personal responsibility , just blaming Wall St.
I 'd be embarrassed to have anyone in my family involved in this non @-@ sense .
Obviously you 're totally ignorant as to the make up of the people participating in the protests .
They are senior citizens who got screwed out of their retirement @...
they are college grads who GOT the grades and are now looking at debt w ith NO job prospects @....
they are parents , spouses , long time employees who saw their jobs outsourced overseas @....
and ALL of them have watched Wall St. and it 's banking buddies in management making out like bandits , and then bitch that they may have to give up some tax breaks and loopholes .
If I were YOU , I 'd be embarrassed to voice your ignorance in public .
Utter fucking nonsense .
I just went from one job to another .
It took me a whole month to find it .
There 's jobs , it 's just that those whiny bitches will n't take anything they can find .
Your lack of information and vast wealth of propaganda , must make it hard to carry on an honest conversation .
Sure they are .
Stop getting your info from Fox .
You guys talk about class warfare , I think the right is more involved in class warfare than anyone else .
The problem is , you are going after people just like you .
Do n't be dim .
I listen to what they say on camera , on msnbc , abc and fox .
They are all a bunch of spoiled kids , or whiny adults that want other people to take care of them .
What the hell does that bolded part mean ?
Anybody ?
I forgot how willfully ignorant and purposely obtuse you can be , Cali @-@ Girl .
Let me dumb it down for you @: Murdoch was born into the American equivalent of upper middle @-@ class @....
the next best thing to being "@ old money @" .
So he had ADVANTAGES from birth @...
he did NOT have to work his way up the ladder or beat his brains to get a scholarship .
So the comparison to Sharpton as a "@ self made man @" is a crock .
Got that , bunky ?
Actually , LackyTiberal , I was wonder when Australia became part of the UK .
Twit .
Still waiting for TackyLiberal to explain what '@ in the UK ( Australia ) @' means .
Australia is not in the UK .
I stand corrected .
Now , do YOU have the cojones to deal with the FACTS that back up my opening posts point regarding the idiotic comparison of Murdoch to Sharpton as "@ self made men @" ?
I 'm a details person @....
factually accurate details .
Lesson @: The United Kingdom @: the countries of England , Scotland , Wales , and Northern Ireland .
Great Britain @: the countries of England , Scotland and Wales .
Not rocket science @.....
or maybe it is .
It seems many Americans are incapable of grasping that fairly straightforward fact .
Now , to address your "@ point @" .
Murdoch inherited two fairly successful newspapers and turned them into a global media empire .
So , he is a '@ self made man @' , if you want to quibble over that , fine .
Personally , I do n't give a shit about Murdoch or Sharpton 's '@ success @' @....
I have zero respect for either .
How 's that obsession working for ya champ ?
If you are addressing me , please explain how telling the truth and pointing out lies RE @: Fox News and the Wall St. occupation an "@ obsession @" ?
Unless you can prove me wrong , it would seem that YOU are obsessed with just being contrary to anything I post .
Carry on .
Anyone reading your manic , endlessly repetitive , one @-@ note screeching on this thread alone can see the obsessive rantings of a defective mind at work .
u do n't need a diploma to be a success
If you 're referring to the Limbaugh @-@ esque BS you 're about to regurgitate , then I whole heartedly agree .
Good for you @....
where do you live ?
where you fired ?
down sized ?
Left for better pay ? what 's the unemployment rate in your area ?
what 's your field of expertise ?
What was the job ?
In the same field as the old one ?
Are you saying that because YOU got a job that everyone else that does n't have one is n't trying ?
Spoken like a true willfully ignorant neocon / teabagger parrot @....
you got yours , so everyone else is just a slacker looking for a handout .
Obviously , the reports of major downsizings by various corporations and industries , the official reports spotlighted by Congress and the Senate showing how companies are NOT opening their doors to higher people , and the 9 % unemployment rate verified by the unemployment insurance rates reported by ALL press regardless of political affiliation is lost on your closed mind .
An apt projection of yourself , bunky .
No , you 're not nuts @...
just a pathetic liar and BS artist .
Bottom line @: my story stands based on FACTS easily verified in the current news .
All YOU 'VE got is some personal claim and some ass backwards assessments as to what 's going on in the REAL world .
Carry on .
No genius , THEY WANT MORE JOBS TO BE AVAILABLE @....
THEY WANT THE RAT BASTARDS ON WALL ST . AND THEIR BANKING BUDDIES TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE CRIMES AGAINST SOCIETY ( THEFT ) , AND THEY WANT TO STOP BEING USED BY THE WEALTHY TO PAY FOR THEIR LARGESSE AND ERRORS I.E. , UNION BUSTING , LOPSIDED TAX BREAKS AND LOOPHOLES .
I got that from listening to MSNBC , ABC , NPR , WBAI @.....
seems YOU need to get your head out of Limbaugh 's fat ass , clean out your ears , and EXPAND YOUR COGNITIVE REASONING AND LISTENING SKILLS .
Actually , you 're just another dumb bunny neocon / teabagger who does n't have the guts to admit you 're wrong as you continually pull stuff out of your ass and try to pass it off as "@ facts @" .
The chronology of the posts shows I readily conceded my geographical error @....
which DOES NOT disprove the FACTS regarding my opening or subsequent posts .
Grow the fuck up , Cali @-@ Girl and stop making an ass of yourself @...
even I am beginning to feel embarrassed for you .
Hate to point out your painfully obvious regurgitation of a false premise ( I lie ) , but his editorial work for a London tabloid DID NOT lead up the ladder of hard work to being head of one of Australia 's leading news paper The Sunday Mail @.....
he INHERITED that when his father died .
Murdoch , the son of Sir Keith Murdoch ( 1886 @–@ 1952 ) , a famous Australian war correspondent and publisher , studied at Worcester College , Oxford ( M.A. , 1953 ) , and briefly worked as an editor on Lord Beaverbrook 's London Daily Express , where he first gained practical experience in the sensationalist journalism that would be a major influence early in his career as a publisher .
His father having died , he returned to Australia in 1954 to take over his inheritance , the Sunday Mail and The News , both of Adelaide
No one is denying Murdoch 's personal success @....
but to keep trying to push this BS that he 's a "@ self made man @" is just that @...
BS . Only a complete idiot would believe that an editor of a tabloid becomes the overnight owner of TWO major newspapers based solely on his merit and salary .
But then again , in the desperate attempt to defend the neocon / teabagger status quo and legends , a Quantum Windbag will blow any smoke necessary .
Carrry on .
Where did I say it did ?
What I said was that he was working for someone else when his father died .
He inherited two papers in Adelaide , the capital of South Australia ( which is a state ) .
He then built those two papers into a major media empire by making them profitable and expanding his holdings to other papers in Australia , and then the UK .
It was what he did after he inherited them that make him a self made man , not the fact that he inherited them .
If he had been like you those papers would have been dead by now and no one would have heard of Murdoch .
tai chi - OCD needs a rest and some heavy meds .
Once again , Cali @-@ Girl displays not only willful ignorance , but a insipid stubborness regarding her ignorance .
The Sunday Mail is a standard MAJOR paper in Australia @...
90 years and standing .
I knew this from years ago , but dumb toots like Cali @-@ Girl could have easily googled such .
I 'll break my rules and do her homework for her just this once @:
<a href="http://www.biography.com/people/rupert-murdoch-9418489"> Rupert Murdoch Biography - Facts , Birthday , Life Story - Biography.com </a>
No one is denying Murdoch 's successes , but a "@ self made man @" is n't handed TWO successful newspapers to start building his empire .
Like all ignorant neocon / teabagger blowhards , once Cali @-@ Girl is proven wrong , she suddenly states that she does n't care about the very subject she so ardently sounds off about .
But again , only a complete idiot would try to make The Sunday Mail the equivalent to a local Penny Saver .
But that 's our Cali @-@ Girl @...
who 's beating the dead horse of my error in putting Australia in the UK despite my conceding and admitting such .
Probably the only orgasm the little fool will have this year .
Carry on .
You 're '@ probably @' an overly emotional whiner .
Truthfully , I do n't give a rat 's ass what Murdoch inherited - it 's not my business .
However , you seem to have an unhealthy interest in other people 's lives .
How sad .
Ahhh , the final gasp by a defeated neocon / teabagger toadie !
Riddle me this , Cali @-@ Girl @...
if you do n't give a rat 's ass about the subject at hand , then why devote so much time and effort in trying to disprove what I wrote ?
Why do you stubbornly keep parroting the same old Limbaugh lines when you KNOW you 've been logically and factually proven wrong ?
Are you having a psychotic break ?
Fucking stupid ?
Stubborn AND Fucking stupid ?
Or do you just have an axe to grind with me personally ?
Tell you what , if you truly do n't care , then STFU , put me on IA and save yourself the trouble .
But if you do n't , then my assessments of you are pretty much on target , and I will n't have to waste any more time on you on this thread .
Adios , muchacha !
There is no evil conspiracy here .
Fox News has been proven to be more fair & balanced than Liberal Media outlets .
Just take a look at the number of Liberal / Socialist commentators they have on air .
Someone posted the list earlier .
Maybe they could post it again ?
And Murdoch is an incredibly successful businessman .
I do n't see how anyone could deny that .
The only thing I questioned - and rightly - was your comment that Australia is in the UK .
Twit .
As you can see by this link , Paulitician is just some clown with an axe to grind who just regurgitates right wingnut talking points and mantras just to be part of the conversation and push along the right wingnut presence .
Just ignore this clown , folks .
<a href="http://www.usmessageboard.com/4267872-post42.html"> Fox tips the balance again . </a>
The chronology of the posts makes Cali @-@ Girl out to be a bald faced LIAR .
And if that were n't enough , there was this from the previous response @:
Say goodnight Gracie @....
shows over for you .
Sure they are .
Wow , you take moran to a whole knew level .
Wall St. did n't steal , obama GAVE them billions .
The rest is the whiny bullshit I was talking about .
Wow , if you 're attempting to insult someone , try improving your spelling skills for a better impact .
Are you truly this ignorant of what went on in the last 12 years , or are you just some insipidly stubborn neocon / teabagger hack ?
Stop , take your two thumbs out of your ass and THINK !
Why was the Wall St. / banker bailouts necessary ?
Then do some honest research and see when all this crap started ( hint @: 8 years of GW Bush ) .
But I suspect you 're just some dumb kid who 'll repeat his neocon / teabagger nonsense ad nauseum while refusing to look at any facts that will contradict your beliefs .
Carry on .
[ If the Daily Kos does n't know that Barak Hussein is n't a Senator , then I would n't expect them to know very much about very much .
Including Candoleezza Rice .
Geez , at least TRY to keep up .
At the time Condoleeza Rice was fielding for Bush Barack Obama was a Senator and that is the time frame the Kos is talking about .
But if for some reason you just can n't get past your lack of confidence in The Daily Kos why not just do some Google research using such keywords as , Condi lied , or variations on that theme .
I promise you 'll come away with a much clearer understanding of this self @-@ serving , mendacious little bitch than you presently have .
You will obviously believe anything , you voted for an empty suit and admit it @..........
you are almost as big of a joke as that dildo rdean .
No .
You did n't follow my link .
Daily Kos
<a href="http://www.dailykos.com/special/about2#dk"> http://www.dailykos.com/special/about2#dk </a>
It goes to the Daily Kos 's description of itself , not to the article .
( thus the link is called ABOUT DAILY KOS )
They still refer to Senator Barack Obama as a contributing blogger to their blog .
I keep hearing about the “@ liberal media @” and yet , it ’s that same liberal media that never asks the difficult questions of Republicans .
Only when Democrats bring up the anti gay stance or anti Muslim or Hispanic stance of Republicans does it make it on the news .
2.4 million jobs moved to China during the Bush Administration and where is the “@ investigative reporting @” ?
Republicans get such a free pass .
So here is Condoleezza on Morning Joe .
She was asked why the US left Afghanistan and went into Iraq ?
She said , “@ We always wanted a “@ small footprint @” in Afghanistan .
There were never going to be more troops @” .
Oh , yea , that makes sense .
Not to you , or to me , but the strategic and tactical goals are not something I am privy to .
Do you know what they were ?
When asked why we got Saddam and not Bin Laden , she actually said that us to get Bin Laden , we would have needed “@ donkeys @” .
I ’m not making this up .
You expect the troops to carry all that equipment themselves ?
She said Iraq is the first democracy in the Middle East , even though the first democracy was actually Iran .
And she ’s a college professor , although a Republican college professor , so she can be forgiven .
Iran ?
Never mind .
You believe that democracy works from the top down , which is why you always vote the way the DNC tells you to vote .
It is a lot easier than thinking for yourself , is n't it ?
She said that Iraq ’s democracy will blunt Iran .
Except Iraq has written Sharia law into their constitution .
Islam is the national religion and all legislation is to be based on Islam .
This is why women are in Burkas .
Why women can n’t go outside without a male escort .
Is it any wonder that their women are addicted to Valium ?
After going from being doctors and engineers and dressing like western women to burkas and being slaves ?
Iraq will n’t blunt Iran .
The US and Republican policies have turned Iraq INTO Iran .
Well , since Iran is a democracy , and Iraq uses Sharia law , they should blunt each other .
Gee , I can actually follow your logic .
And on racism , when asked about Katrina , and remember , when two whites were shown with bottled water and bread , they were called “@ survivors @” , but when two blacks had bottled water and bread , they were “@ looters @” , she said , “@ We have to stop talking about race to “@ heal @” .
Sounds like a typical Republican “@ plan @” .
Shut the victims up and everything will go away .
Is the government supposed to interfere with free speech ?
Or are you trying to claim the Rice herself said these things ?
And no one challenged her on anything .
It was a disgrace .
What exactly were they supposed to challenge her on ?
What did she lie about ?
You 're a fucking racist .
Is this a mainstream attitude within the left ?
As I told you elsewhere , if I were a racist I would not have voted for Obama .
But the word racist is so over @-@ used and so frequently misused that it 's come to mean whatever the respective user wants it to mean .
So , once again , my understanding of the word racist is it refers to one who dislikes all members of a specific race because they belong to that race -- which excludes me from the category .
By the way , I hasten to add that if I were a racist I would not hesitate to admit it because I 'd have no reason not to .
Now , what is your definition of the word , racist ?
What exactly is it you 're accusing me of .
I do not know what her definition of racist is , but if you want mine I suggest you look in a mirror .
<a href="http://theoccidentalobserver.net/tooblog/?p=3073"> Christoper Donovan @: Hate @-@ Fueled Black Mass Murderer in Connecticut Spun as ‘@ Disgruntled Man @’ by Media The Occidental Observer Blog </a>
Yet the majority of the MSM totally underplayed the racial angle , for reasons everyone by now understands @: the killer was black , and the victims were white .
My own local newspaper made absolutely no mention of the racial element in the small brief it ran .
But given that race was what ( rightly or wrongly ) drove the entire incident , the media ’s censorship of this is a gross dereliction of duty .
His own words indicted him as a racist .
He was a thief and got caught so he decided to exact retribution against all of those racists he did n't like .
That 's pretty close to the truth although I think he suffered from other problems and scapegoated others for those problems .
This is common among people who suffer deep depression or other illnesses .
Now , if he was drinking on the job he just exacerbated the situation 10 fold because alchohol is simply a sedative that slowly puts your brain to sleep starting with the logical side so your left running on pure emotion .
Very bad and has nothing to do with him being black .
i think anyone who goes in to work and kills 8 people is probably suffering from some sort of illness .
Regardless of why he did it , I still do n't see how thinking other people treated one in a racist manner makes one a racist .
And funny that WJ would accuse someone of being what he so proudly is @....

Being black is n't a genetic defect @.....
but mentally this guy was all screwed up because of his obsession with race .
This guy was messed up @....
only a social degenerate feels that murder is a solution to depression .
If he had been white and ALL his victims black @.....
ya the press would not have mentioned that at all .
Maybe if the company hired more blacks or asians all the victims would n't have been white .
Or maybe he would n't have felt justified in killing anyone .
Then again maybe he was just a low @-@ life that could n't get along with anyone of the wrong color .
Maybe he feels everyone hates him because he 's black
I think race was simply an easy answer for him .
I do n't think he was necessarily racist to begin with .
It 's possible , but we do n't have enough to data to say either wasy so we can only speculate .
You 'd be surprised what extremely sad people are capable of when they start to pin their problems on the wrong people .
They turn hate into violence .
It does n't sound like he killed people simply because they were white .
The irony here is that if it had been a white man killing black people with the same circumstances , you would have made it a racial issue , Ravi @....
no doubt about that .
Your stereotypes run deep , do n't they ?
I thought I was pointing out your stereotype , Ravi .
Got any PROOF of that Skippy ?
"@ You probably want to know the reason why I shot this place up , @" Thornton said .
"@ They treat me bad over here , and they treat all the other black employees bad over here too .
So I just took it into my own hands and I handled the problem , @" he said .
"@ I wish I coulda got more of the people . @"
The guys a real idiot .
I mean , why did he kill himself ?
I 'm sure eric holder would have had all the charges against him dropped .
Sounds like this nutter was racially motivated to be sure .
But the primary issue here is that he was a nutter who decided to kill people who pissed him off .
What motivated him to target Whites is actually not all that important .
Nutters often target one group or the other .
Woman are the most targeted demographic by serial murderers , regardless of race .
And coworkers ( also regardless of race ) are the people most frequently targeted in work @-@ related mass killing events like this .
If the place had been manned by Black people ?
It 's entirely possible this nutter would still have killed everybody he could find .
We 'll never know , really .
Maybe the White people drove him crazy at work , but I kinda doubt it .
He was nuts first .
His targets ( and his stated motivation ) are just based on who was around him to become targets would be my guess .
In this guy 's case ?
It was White people he could blame , and therefore attempt to justify his murderous urge .
Co @-@ workers are often the targets in work @-@ related murders ?
Sorry , for some reason it 's funny that was pointed out .
He was just a disgruntled common thief who got caught stealing beer ( on video ) , got fired , mass murdered , who happened to be black .
No more , no less .
Onto the next roadside attraction @.....
exactly
Other then the fact that he bragged to his mother that he killed white people .
Was that thru a medium ?
Cause he 's dead .
Actually , he was more playing the VICTIM , the MARTYR .
You have to open your mind to the distinct possibility that accusations of "@ racist @" against whites themselves come from the racist motivations of non @-@ whites .
I know , you have to connect a few dots there .
But that 's what 's going on .
If you do n't know what happened , why do you comment ?
There was no racism at his workplace .
We 've elected a black President , we are in the "@ post @-@ racial @" era , remember ?
That could be true in some cases but I imagine it is actually pretty rare .
Out of 69 dock workers only four were black and I 'd hate to be one of the three still there .
Maybe but when a guy goes off and kills a bunch of People and after the Fact he and his Family say it was because of Racism .
when that Person never reported any such problems to his Job or Union .
You have to wonder if maybe this is not one of the "@ rare @" times .
only 4 eh , well lest see blacks are 11 % of the population .
So 7 would have been an exact Fair representation of Blacks to white with 69 total Employees .
4 is low but not terribly so .
He claimed racism at his other jobs too .
According to them , the ONLY trustworthy news source is Fox news .
I mean , any station that reports the news that does n't slant their way is obviously liberal biased .
Could n't the the right be saying the exact same thing about the liberal biased media ?
UCLA did a study a few years ago which proved liberal bias .
CBS , NBC , ABC did n't do any story on the Black Panther fiasco , nor the follow up with the A.J. I guess it was n't newsworthy enough for the liberal media .
So I 'll ask this again .
Which is more likely , be honest @...
That ALL media , except for Fox news is biased .
While Fox news is the only one reporting fair and even coverage of every story
OR
Or there are biased news on both sides , Fox on one side , MSNBC on the other and everything else just falls in between .
Step back and give me an honest answer .
Which one seems more plausible ?
It might be wise to just throw out the labels and ask why a story is or is not covered .
What seems plausible is that the gatekeeppers are still keeping the gates .
I think white conservatives are the last one I need explaining racism to me .
When you focus nearly 95 percent on racism against whites you draw ridicule from educated people .
Then you oppose Affirmative Action .
Affirmative action is a liberals way of saying your inferior in a "@ nice @" way .
Ah another liberal being a racist .
Implying he does not need to listen to conservatives why ?
Because we are all racist ?
You do realize thinking like that is just as bad as thinking an entire race is inferior right .
Fox is not news , it 's republican propaganda .
Msnbc is not quit as bad , but their sophomoric ways expose them .
Fox at least pretends with the fair balanced line for the moron tea baggers .
Fox is biased to the right , I will not deny it , but they are far more Fair and balanced than CNN or LOL MSNBC . If you actually watch Fox news , Not the commentators like hanity and what not .
I mean the Hard News part .
They are always very fair , and always have both sides of a story , and both sides represented by their guests .
Just got done watching a Segment on CNN about the NAACP vs Tea Party controversy .
As you all know the NAACP is alleging that Tea Party Rallies are "@ rampant with overt racial messages and signs @"
So they had 2 African American men on .
1 from the Tea Party and one from the NAACP .
The segment lasted maybe 7 mins , and CNN allowed the guy from the NAACP to about 5 mins of that time .
He Repeatedly claimed the Tea Party is rampant with Racism .
During the entire 7 mins CNN was showing 3 different signs from a tea party rally .
Over and Over .
Just 3 , which were mildly racial .
The worst had a picture of what looks like an African Native doing a dance and said Obama Care with the C as a hammer and sickle .
One said "@ Send oBUMa back to kenya @" , and the other one was not racial at all but made Obama look like a Nazi or Soviet style propaganda picture basically .
So after letting the Guy from the NAACP talk nearly the whole time .
They finally let the Guy from the Tea Party talk .
He of course said that CNN and the NAACP were purposely focusing on a handful of Signs and ingoring , and even deliberately not showing the Hundreds of other signs that were not even remotely Racist .
now as there is video on the internet of CNN doing just that before .
I have no reason to assume anything other than they are doing just that right now .
Interestingly enough the NAACP is also claiming there were more than one sigh that read "@ Lynch Obama @" and "@ Lynch Holder @" .
One problem .
NOBODY has been able to produce a single photo of these alleged signs .
In Fact , I can not remember the guys name , but someone has offered 100,000 Dollars to anyone who can produce a picture of the alleged signs .
Please people in todays world of A camera in every phone .
There is NO WAY in hell there were signs that Read "@ Lynch Obama @" or "@ Lynch Holder @" and nobody got a picture of them .
Simply no way in hell .
This is clearly a complete Fabrication , and it is also Clear CNN and the Rest of the Liberal Media are continuing to cherry pick signs from Tea Party rally 's , and try to Paint the Tea Party as racist .
Very disturbing that such a large segment of our Media , is not only Biased , but actually working for the Democrats .
Actively Slanting stories to try and Destroy the Tea Party .
They should all be Ashamed , and have no Right to call themselves objective .
Very pathetic .

Fox is widely ridiculed by educated people .
It 's entertainment for conservatives .
Bill Maher Saturday said America loves its military members the way disgraced football player Michael Vick loves dogs .
In his HBO special "@ Bill Maher @...
But I 'm Not Wrong , @" the outspoken comedian went on a vulgarity @-@ laden two @-@ minute rant against Republicans and the troops .
BILL MAHER @: For the longest time , every Republican election has been based on some sentimental bulls**t @: the flag , or the flagpin , or the Pledge , or the , "@ It 's morning in America . @"
Bill Clinton got a blowjob in the Oval Office .
And the Dixie Chicks insulted President Bush on foreign soil .
And when that happens , it hurts the feelings of our troops .
And then Tinkerbell 's light goes out and she dies .
Yes , yes , the love of our troops , the ultimate in fake patriotism .
Are you kidding ?
The troops , we pay them like s**t , we f**k them and trick them on deployment , we nickel and dime them on medical care when they get home , not to mention the stupid wars that we send them to .
Yeah , we love the troops the way Michael Vick loves dogs .
You know how I would feel supported if I was a troop overseas ?
If the people back home were clamoring to get me out of this pointless errands .
That 's how I would feel supported .
But , you know , do n't hold your breath on that one fellas because , you know , when America invades a country , we love you long time .
Seriously , we never , we leave like Irish relatives @: not at all .
Honestly , is this REALLY what HBO wants broadcast on its network ?

He 's not wrong .
Why do n't you go look at the number of soldiers who have had to stay well beyond their initial employment contract .
Or the number of soldiers who get classified as having "@ personality disorders @" instead of PTSD .
Or why do n't you go talk to Pat Tillman or countless other families who can n't get the truth from the Military about their loved ones death or get the benefits that they well deserve .
And the fact we not only went to Iraq but had troops lose their lives is a tragedy in itself .
He 's not ranting against the troops .
He 's ranting against people like you likely .
Oh , and never mind the fact it took years to get our troops serving overseas to get proper body armor .
And to this day , some of them still do not have proper equipment .
Can you ever imagine being a parent who has to go to a pawn shop to get body armor for your son because the government is too cheap to provide it because they feel it is not cost effective for your son to be worth a couple extra hundred dollars ?
I 'd say you put your foot in your mouth , but you just can n't seem to get your head out of your ass long enough at one time to do so .
Bill Maher may be feeling inadequate these days so he 's cutting loose with another lefty rant to get his name in print .
It 's how he makes his living .
Having no acting skills and very little talent Maher is becoming passe @' and he does n't like it .
Could n't have said it any better @...
go Bill !
Saying he stuck his foot in his mouth , implies that he feels sorry or embarrassed about what he said .
I highly doubt he is either .
And you obviously do n't watch HBO very much !
Well I guess it is good that his popular show starts next week .
We fuck our people in uniform over all the time .
Its crazy .
Is n't this standing up for our troops ?
Wanting them to get better pay , better medical care , force them to extend deployments ?
Foot in mouth ?
Can you read ?
And this is different from the others that make their living off of political punditry in what way ?
Oh I 'm sorry , I must have missed it , what exactly about this quote is incorrect ???
What a retarded poll .
First off - MA was predominately about local politics ( the same reason that a Democrat won that NY seat in a Republican stronghold ) - local issues and someone who LISTENED to what the people were saying - economy , jobs , deficits etc. Partisan morons on both sides are try to make it into party referendums or a referendum on the President .
Yet President Obama still enjoys wide approval by the MA voters .
The other issue - MA 's feelings about healthcare reform is also somewhat colored by the fact that MA has it 's own affordable healthcare program in place so it 's far less of a priority to it 's citizens than economy and jobs .
If you really think Obama is a "@ radical socialist @" you really need to bone up on your history .
Obama 's approval ratings are PLUMMETING around the nation !
you have got to be kidding , even in California !
While they are decreasing ( they started off unrealistically high ) - he still maintains pretty decent approval .
Even Brown said that the election was not a referendum on the president @: "@ It 's not a referendum on the president .
There are many issues ; you 're talking about national security , taxes , spending -- the health care plan certainly is important . @"
It is , however a warning shot that he needs to listen to what people are concerned about .
MA Exit polls showed strong support for Obama @:

What is SHOULD be about is the tragedy of this little girl , and countless other children killed every year by either a stranger , or someone they know .
SICK FREAKS COME IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES !
Using kids to make political points regarding criticism from right about criticism from leftist comedian .
It 's the left 's moronic insistence that #1 , children are n't valuable and are disposable , and #2 , they should be viewed sexually , that is at the base of the terrible situation children are in now .
I do n't argue with that point at all , I may favor more progressive and liberal views on most things but family I am very traditional and conservative and am against sickos and pervs that do this kinda shit @...
that being said I really do n't think sooo much "@ outrage @" should be put on ONE late night talkers attempt on bad sex jokes , there is WAY more to it then that that makes these people do these things !
It goes on because dumb ass Liberals keep defending him .
But a significant percentage of the human population will .
And how many is that and show me your proof that people just will n't move to another area .
BTW if they do n't move , whose fault is that ?
Damned peanuts in the US last year , damned wheat in Australia last year , and damned grains in Russia in 2010 should have all walked to somewhere they could have grown properly .
Really dumb statements , Skull .
So if the earth warms areas that are too cold to grow crops will not become more fertile ?
The entire earth will become a scorched wasteland huh ?
OK Chicken Little .
Another inconvenient fact for the man made global warming crowd .
Since 1998 until today there has been no significant warming .
A further fact .
In the early 1900 's scientists predicted that over the next 100 years the temperature would go up globally about 1 degree .
And that is what it did .
So we had an 18 year trend that saw a rise of 1 / 3 of a degree world wide .
Followed to date by a 14 year period with no appreciable warming .
Remind me again how we are all doomed ?
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14527-climate-myths-global-warming-stopped-in-1998.html"> Climate myths @: Global warming stopped in 1998 - environment - 15 August 2008 - New Scientist </a>
According to the dataset of the UK Met Office Hadley Centre ( see figure ) , 1998 was the warmest year by far since records began , but since 2003 there has been slight cooling .
But according to the dataset of NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( see figure ) , 2005 was the warmest since records began , with 1998 and 2007 tied in second place .
Tracking the heat · Why the difference ?
The main reason is that there are no permanent weather stations in the Arctic Ocean , the place on Earth that has been warming fastest .
The Hadley record simply excludes this area , whereas the NASA version assumes its surface temperature is the same as that of the nearest land @-@ based stations .
Where the monitoring station positions are cuts both ways @..........
there are significant temperature differences just 40 @-@ 50 miles either way .
The k00ks never want people to know about that .
Anybody who can n't recognize that temperature station data readings are the definitive example of cherry picking = hopelessly duped .
I just realised I never actually answered the OP .
Amelia , it will be too late when the asteroid impacts somewhere on the planet and wipes out civilization .
Too late because we COULD have done something about that .
On the other hand , other than cooling the planet ( relatively easy to do ) warming it up is far , far , far beyond our ability .
The point is , regardless of when it was , the ecosystem was completely different .
What caused the '@ global warming @' then ?
If the Earth is warming , which it currently is not , there is nothing we have done to cause it , nor is there anything we can do to stop it .
You think trading carbon credits and enriching a small subset of people in the process is going to '@ save @' the planet ?
Give me a break .
And I 'm thought a fool for believing in God .
What caused warming in the past is irrelevant and the blanket statement that we can n't be causing it is false .
We know the properties of CO2 and know that it 's about 100 ppm above historical averages , since the advent of the Industrial Revolution with no other explanation for its rise .
Given those facts , who 's kidding who ?
It 's time for the skeptics to prove something , not just sit back and deny or ignore facts that pile up on a daily basis .
You 're quick to jump on the factoid that "@ the earth is n't warming up right now @" , but even saying that shows the shallowness of the skeptic argument .
Any other time we 'd be hearing about "@ natural cycles @" , but when given evidence of just such a cycle blunting a warming trend , we hear crickets chirp !
Top that off with "@ carbon credits @" and that just shows that the argument from the skeptic side is political in nature and they 've given up on the science , preferring mere lip service about what happened in the past and natural cycles , but nothing about what 's been happening for the last ~@ 200 years !
You can n't take the past as a template for the future , if underlying conditions have changed .
That 's basic science AND logic .
Okay , you 're a lost cause .
So , we have another dumb fuck that gets his science from Time and other news magazines .
Ever hear of peer reviewed scientific journals ?
Not to mention placing them in urban heat sinks .
Gathering temperature data from an airport tarmac yields a vastly different result than from a park or a forest .
In Corona CA , they moved the recording device from the airport to the city hall - less than a half mile away , and average temperatures dropped 7 ° - a huge amount .
Former Mayor , Jeff Miller was elected to congress , and was able to effect the change .
Anthony Watts did an in-depth study on this particular bit of fraud .
It is startling .

A new paper exposing the myth of 70 s global cooling · Over time , William Connelly has been steadily documenting 70 s research predicting global cooling .
It 's a rich resource but as he admits , could be more accessible .
Now he has collaborated with Thomas Peterson and Jr the liar you are.ohn Fleck to publish The Myth of the 1970 's Global Cooling Scientific Consensus , due to be published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society .
The paper surveys climate studies from 1965 to 1979 ( and in a refreshing change to other similar surveys , lists all the papers ) .
They find very few papers ( 7 in total ) predict global cooling .
This is n't surprising .
What surprises is that even in the 1970 s , on the back of 3 decades of cooling , more papers ( 42 in total ) predict global warming due to CO2 than cooling .
And just wait till you see what they have to say about the business of global warming orthodoxy 40 years from now .
40 years from now they will be talking about the assholes that could not recognize reality and prevented even preperation for consequences .
And what they say will not be complimentary .
Yeah , and 40 years ago some assholes with an agenda or a buck to make said the same thing about anyone who was n't '@ sure @' we 'd all be under glaciers by now .
Chumps like you are nothing new .

Sorry , AGW has been proven .
The only questions remaning are "@ when @" and "@ how bad @" .
Sorry to have to call you a liar konradv , but alas , you are a liar .
AGW has not been proven .
In fact , it has not even been elevated to the level of a theory .
AGW remains a piss poor hypothesis lacking a single shred of hard , observable , repeatable evidence that provides a hard link between the activities of man and the changing climate .
I already showed you that there has been no decrease in outgoing LW radiation since 1970 according to the satellite record in spite of a marked increase in atmospheric CO2 .
The facts simply do n't support the AGW claims .
But once again , if you believe there is proof that provides a hard link between the activities of man and the changing climate or that there is anything going on in the climate today that is outside the boundries of natural variability , feel free to post your proof .
By the way , a claim that it has been posted rather than an actual posting will only tend to reinforce my claim that you are a liar .
So says an anamous message board poster .
In the meantime , all the Scientific Societies in the world , all the National Academies of Science , and all the major Universities state AGW is a fact and a clear and present danger to all of us .
Oh , who to believe ??????????????
All of them ?
All of us ?
And your level of expertise in this field is ?
It is time to tell the truth .

Let me try harder
Whether to read a report or not , perhaps you should take a gander at it and see what it says yourself .

Your eyes will n't bleed from the truth honestly .
"@ Unlike the surface @-@ based temperatures , global temperature measurements of the Earth 's lower atmosphere obtained from satellites reveal no definitive warming trend over the past two decades .
The slight trend that is in the data actually appears to be downward .
The largest fluctuations in the satellite temperature data are not from any man @-@ made activity , but from natural phenomena such as large volcanic eruptions from Mt. Pinatubo , and from El Niño .
So the programs which model global warming in a computer say the temperature of the Earth 's lower atmosphere should be going up markedly , but actual measurements of the temperature of the lower atmosphere reveal no such pronounced activity .
In theory , one could argue that the computer models are accurate , and that the real measurements have some problem .
However this is not the case .
An incredible amount of work has been done to make sure that the satellite data are the best quality possible .
Recent claims to the contrary by Hurrell and Trenberth have been shown to be false for a number of reasons , and are laid to rest in the September 25 th edition of Nature ( page 342 ) .
The temperature measurements from space are verified by two direct and independent methods @....
First , the influence of a man @-@ made doubling of the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is small compared to the Earth 's natural cooling rate , on the order of only a percent .
Second , there is a much more important greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide , namely water vapor .
Water vapor over the Earth is extremely variable , both in space and in time .
Third , the ways in which clouds and water vapor feed back and ultimately influence the temperature of the Earth are , at best , poorly understood .
Fourth , while the whole Earth is indeed in a state that scientists describe as "@ radiative equilibrium , @" where the incoming sunlight equals the outgoing infrared radiation to provide a roughly constant overall temperature , the surface is far from this radiative balance condition .
Evaporation and convection processes in the atmosphere transport heat from the surface to the upper troposphere , where it can be much more efficiently radiated into space since it is above most of the greenhouse @-@ trapping water vapor .
So in short , it is this convective overturning of the atmosphere - poorly represented in computer models of global warming - that primarily determines the temperature distribution of the surface and upper troposphere , not radiation balance . @"

Could it be that the ocean is cooling ?
<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88520025"> The Mystery of Global Warming 's Missing Heat : NPR </a>
The Mystery of Global Warming 's Missing Heat · by Richard Harris
Stuart Westmorland · Oceans hold much more heat than the atmosphere can .
Corbis
There has been a very slight cooling , but not anything really significant , @" Willis says .
So the buildup of heat on Earth may be on a brief hiatus . "
Global warming does n't mean every year will be warmer than the last .
And it may be that we are in a period of less rapid warming .
In recent years , heat has actually been flowing out of the ocean and into the air .
This is a feature of the weather phenomenon known as El Nino .
So it is indeed possible the air has warmed but the ocean has not .
But it 's also possible that something more mysterious is going on .
That becomes clear when you consider what 's happening to global sea level .
Sea level rises when the oceans get warm because warmer water expands .
This accounts for about half of global sea level rise .
So with the oceans not warming , you would expect to see less sea level rise .
Instead , sea level has risen about half an inch in the past four years .
That 's a lot .
Willis says some of this water is apparently coming from a recent increase in the melting rate of glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica .
But in fact there 's a little bit of a mystery .
We can n't account for all of the sea level increase we 've seen over the last three or four years , @" he says .
One possibility is that the sea has , in fact , warmed and expanded — and scientists are somehow misinterpreting the data from the diving buoys .
But if the aquatic robots are actually telling the right story , that raises a new question @: Where is the extra heat all going ?
If you read the whole article he does n't sound like he knows if he is coming or going but that sounds about right .
Lol @...
"@ Global Warming 's Missing Heat @" .
That 's funny .
The real brains are more concerned about global cooling , and they are REALLY concerned about it right now .
And physics has firmly established the absorbtion spectra of CO2 .
And the fact that we have had rapid increases in CO2 and CH4 in the past , and the result , in every case , was rapid warming .
That the initial cause was trapp volcanics in no way changes the result , simply because now the cause is the activities of man .
Like your stand on evolution , your talking points reveal a deep misunderstanding of how science is done , and how conclusions are reached .
You may want to examine what you do n't understand .
Most of us understand science just fine in terms of how hypotheses are tested and how conclusions are reached @..
I would say it is you that does not understand science .
It is n't science that you believe in or are practicing .
What you are practicing is faith in the religion that is AGW .
After all you do n't really understand the science behind it as well as your cherry picked experts .
Therefore it is simply a faith that you have that one group of people is right and you have chosen to ignore the rest , much like a christian only has faith in Jesus @' and ignores budha or the spirits native american 's believed in .
Atmospheric CO2 causes the earth to retain heat .
This was proved experimentally in 1859 .
We have increased atmospheric CO2 by 40 % in the last 200 years .
We are adding 8 billion tons of CO2 to the atmosphere every year .
If our atmosphere was that simple you would have your case made .
Except our atmosphere is far from that simple .
It is truly laughable to watch you people trying to convince yourselves that you understand any of this when you obviously do n't @' understand even basic concepts like what constitutes an actual correllation .
Do yourself a favor , take a math class and learn how to derive a correct correlation co @-@ efficient , run CO2 numbers over time with temperature over time and let us know what the number is .
THEN tell us if you have a case .
What we do know about you is that first and foremost you 're a died in the wool liberal .
Global warming is a liberal religion .
That 's really why you believe in it .
Not because you understand the science and certainly not because you 've evaluated the contradictory evidence .
Why is Venus hotter than Mercury ?
Because Mercury has no atmosphere to speak of .
Now you dishonest prick , explain how two planets with atmoshpheres nothing like earths even comes close to proving your point .
I challenge you to ask any scientist if he would find credible such a ridculous analogy as this one .
The scope of differing variables between Venus is Earth is so broad as to render the two incomparable .
Watching someone who thinks they 're so smart make comparisons that are so scientifically stupid is truly amusing .
Yeah .
Let 's nationalize energy so that the same people who are granting waivers from ObamaCare to their pals can rig the distribution and pricing so that the well connected get plentiful bargains and the rest of us are screwed .
Energy makes the world go around , especially in todays society .
Electricity is a must have if you intend on living in the United States , with the notable exception of the Amish .
Let it be said though that even the Amish are having a hard time fitting in and are moving further and further west .
We use electricity for a wide variety of essential everyday needs from running our refridgerators ( food ) , heating our homes ( shelter ) , providing lights so we can operate and function around the clock , and to run our televisions ( information gathering ) .
Wether you have electricity or not determines what type of society you live in such as in the industrial world , or the third world .
The question to ask yourself is @...
can I live for over a year without electricity ?
Every post cataclysmic scenerio puts man back decades if not longer because of the lack of electricity , society crumbles without it .
Electricity comes from a variety of sources , water , wind , solar , nuclear , and fosil fuels .
Oil being the most versitile of the lot is the most coveted .
Our society has entwined itself with oil and has become so dependant on it that without it we would not last very long .
Oil provides the means to do everything from transportation to production to providing electricity , and to heating our homes ( along with natural gas ) .
I believe it would be fair to put oil into the same catagory as electricity when it comes to it 's effect on society if it became absent .
Society would crumble .
Though it would be easier to get by without oil than electricity the effects would be very comparable .
Let it be noted that alot of our electricity comes from oil as well .
Given the facts about electricity and oil and their effects and contributions to society I can not understand how energy in the United States has not been nationalized yet .
In todays day and age with speculators and oil companies record setting profits how is it that this is allowed to continue ?
I would put forth that in the intrests of the population our energy should be produced , maintained , and provided by our government to ensure an affordable price to all .
Now wether the government hires independent contractors to help with this or not would remain to be seen .
Would this make us a socialist society ?
absolutely .
Would this be a difficult transition ?
Would this be beneficial to the population as a whole ?
Would the oil fat cats and energy mongers fight this tooth and nail ?
without question , yes .
In the quest for energy independence I feel that it is a must that we nationalize our energy sector .
To leave it up to individuals to do what is right has not proven to be the answer ( greed ) , leaving it up to wall street has also proven not to be the answer ( free market system / capitalism ) , and leaving it up to government regulations ( politics ) is not the answer either .
Even dealing with OPEC has proven not to work ( foreign policy ) .
We as a nation of free people need to re @-@ evaluate our energy situation before we are no longer a free people .
This I believe is what our government was created to do , protect us from enemies foreign and domestic , and to maintain a fair and level playing field for all .
We are already part way there , we maintain a standing army and now we must follow up with a nationalized energy policy to ensure our way of life , our civilization can survive and thrive .
It 's funny how you say we 'll lose our freedom if we do n't give up our freedom .
Where have I heard something like that before @...@ ?
Oh , yeah --
War is Peace .
Ignorance is Strength .
Freedom is Slavery .
So , to answer your question , no .
Not happening .
It is very important for our future .
Socialism is a failure .
SOME things that governmenht do , they do very well .
I do not think that nationaling the assets of oil compnaies is remotely a good idea , though .
There might be one way to test that theory , though . , and no nationalization of private peroperty is necessary
The USA still owns plenty of land and offshore locations where there 's oil .
Instead of selling the right to drill to a private company , let the government try to set up its own oil company .
I suspect that the oil will n't be brought up out of the ground any more chearply than the private companies do it .
by nationalizing , the prices would absolutely go , down because if we the people being the govenment decide that oil needs to break even and the government does n't need to make a profit then the price will definitally go down .
Gas will become cheaper when it comes to the profit margin .
Oil without question is the lifeblood of our economy and thus society .
Far too important to be left in the hands of an inept Government .
The government does n't have a profit motive .
They do n't care whether they make a profit , break even , or go in the red .
They will simply spend the entire budget allocation on oil production and whether or not its financially efficient will be of no concern to them because another budget will be passed with another allocation in the future .
Funding would come from tax dollars , which are theoretically available forever .
So if money is lost producing oil , who cares , there 's money available forever .
As long as oil is being provided , right ?
You could always ASSUME that people would keep the system running properly through their due diligence and their vote , but I do n't see that happening anywhere else with government spending so why think it would be different with government @-@ run oil production ?
OP killer right there .
Not really .
And it sort of supports the OP @..
although that 's not the intention .
I 'd go out on a limb and say the oil industry is already nationalized .
It 's become pretty obvious now that the government will financially back stop big companies in the event that they face bankruptcy .
So if Exxon makes a bunch of stupid mistakes and loses their ass , our tax dollars will prop them up anyway .
This way , we do n't actually have to CALL it nationalization .
Nonsense .
^ this @...
but then @...
what 's that Mussolini referred to as the perfect merger between the corporation and the state ?
Would it ?
Are you absolutely sure about that ?
Why ?
Show us the numbers and how the government would insure that there was enough energy and how they would fairly share it .

It usually takes a few posts before someone invokes Godwin 's law , congratulations on doing it on the first post .
The government was created because idiots like you wanted power to be concentrated in the hands of a select few and no one wanted to see that happen here .
Congratulations on becoming the enemy you are calling on the government to fight .
My guess is that it will not only be more expensive , it will actually take longer to drill , and end up being more harmful to the environment .
CFLs will actually cut down on mercury pollution produced by coal burning , and EPA agrees .

What most all modern day economists have in common is they believe in the control / plan model of economics .
There is a concensus that economics is a hard science , when it is not .
In order to prove their a priori values correct in mathematics , they must eventually succumb to controlling it all .
Economics is a human action and can not be quantified in natural science .
Monetarists have some things right , but fall right into the planning trap .
The point is that since you 're so keen on telling everybody to go to college and constantly informing us of your immense understanding of Econ 101 , you should know better than anybody the basis you were asking for .
No point in sucking eggs .
Friedman was n't for central planning at all .
He ideally wanted Free Banking .
The point of monetarism was that given that central banks exist , which is n't to say that they should , they should be constrained by binding rules and have any discretion taken away from them .
Strange to call that being "@ for central planning @" .
But that 's part and parcel of the whole libertarian / anarchist internet culture .
Anybody that holds opinions based on contingencies that occur in reality rather than constantly pounding the same extreme views is a "@ statist @" .
Problem with Friedman is that he failed to recognize what Basiat did in "@ The Law @" @...
That given the choice between work and plunder , most people would choose the latter @...
Which exposes the fatal conceit of monetarists @: They actually believe that you can put imperfect humans in charge of the money supply without them rigging the game to benefit themselves and their friends .
I sure you 're well versed in the fact that you still can n't push a rope .
False analogy .
It 's the entire underlying premise of economic central control in general and Keynesian economics in particular .
Fluffing that flawed premise with a flurry of incomprehensible semantics can n't change the fact .
And now we have a strawman .
Is there any fallacy you will n't invoke ?
he advised Pinochet only about how to manage monetary policy .
In fact , he gave him the same advice he gave our Presidents .
he said that ?
Then why be so afraid to prove it ?
and your best example of this would be ??
So I take it you 're not at all familiar with Friedman or monetarism then .
He wanted a k-percent rule so that a computer could control the money supply .
The entire point was removing human discretion from monetary policy .
No strawman at all @....
I know bullshit semantics when I hear them @...
I 'm well trained and versed in the practice .
Amongst the biggest bullshitters on the planet are neo @-@ Keynesian economists and their kissing cousin Chicago monetarists .
A matter of weeks after screwing the pooch in Iraq Obama is doing what I knew he would do even before he was elected .
Bush just spent 7 years rebuilding the military and Obama like the liberal he is decimates it .
If a Republican wins in November the cycle will repeat itself .
Obama wants us to think the threats are gone .
Actually Iran is proving they 're worse .
However , Obama has a plan .
Gut the military to pay for his social programs and then hope nobody starts anything with whatever resources we have left .
Today we were told not to talk about our opinions on this matter while at work .
Sounds like the orders we received when I was still on a team .
Do n't bad @-@ mouth the ignorant SOB or face charges .
Screw it .
An American and a N Korean are sitting in this bar and the the American turns to the guy and asks "@ Kim Jong Il 's son is now your leader @" he says sarcasticly .
"@ How can you put someone with zero leadership expirience in charge of your military ?? @"
The N Korean turns to him and says with a grin "@ You should talk @......
at least our President is n't afraid of Victory @" .

I do n't suppose it occurred to you to provide us with some empirical evidence to support this charge of yours , did it ?
Obama ’s $ 3.7 Trillion Budget Calls for Military Spending Increases and Deep Cuts to Social Service Programs

Of course Republicans did nothing with Obama 's budget because theer was n't enough of a free ride for the rich in his plan .
I wrote on here when Panetta was named SECDEF that he was sent there to dismantle the place .
Military end @-@ strength goes way down during Democrat administrations .
No surprise here .
This time it will be worse .
They are going after pay , retirement , and health care benefits .
Not cool Mr. Prez .
Remember the Bush budget that Cut money to the VA ?
During his wars while the wounded were still rolling in .
I do remember .
I have no problems with the increased funding for the VA , TBI treatment , PTSD , veteran unemployment initiatives , and other such efforts by the current administration .
I also have applauded the First Lady and Dr. Jill Biden for their pro @-@ miltary platform .
My comments are concerning the maintenence of a strong military and the career designated personnel that operate it .
I 've lived throught the bad years and the good ones and prefer the good ones .
I 'm not whining about losing my benefits as they can n't touch my monthly retirement check except for the annual COLA .
They can and probably will mess with my health care , although I do n't mind a modest increase in premiums .
VA funding and DOD monies come from different pots .
Man this is the worst time for this , we need our Military to be in its best shape right now .
Yeah because we gotta kill them brown people , they 're taking over !
Not what I said ass wipe .
Most of the expense of the rebuild went to new equipment , new armored vehicles , fuel for ships and planes , upgrades on garrison facilities .
Now all of that will go to waste .
Civilian job positions are n't being filled .
New facilities needing maintainance are already falling into decay .
There is only so much fat you can trim from an already lean fighting force .
But Obama thinks he can bullshit us into thinking he 'll make the military better .
He just wants something smaller and less expensive .
He wants to turn us into a second @-@ rate world power .
None of his flowery words will prevent that .
Are you fucking serious ?
"@ Lean @" ?
We spend more money on our Military than the next 10 largest militaries combined .
Thats because of our cost of living expenses .
We pay our troops and civilian employees / contractors a hell of a lot more than other countries .
All the equipment it uses is much more expensive as well since most of it is manufactured here .
Yet many countries have far a bigger military ( troop size ) than the US .
My son is a Sgt in the Army , Ft Bragg .
We spent Christmas with him and his family , and he talked about Obama wanting to cut their pay .
He 's been to Iraq 3 times , and now training in PsyOps .
They should NEVER cut the pay of our military .
They risk their lives for US @....
Islam want 's our country to die @....
and our great leader want 's it too .
of course Odumber wants to cut the pay or make people get out with 15 years in so they do not get their retirement or medical benefits they worked so hard for .
So he has money for his pet projects and the people in Washington get their pay raises
Yeah thats true we do spend more than the next 10 largest militaries combined .
But If I am not mistaken we protect far more interests and humanitarian aid is included in the DOD budget .
Also at a time where soldiers are averaging multiple deployments in their first 5 years I do n't think a troop reduction is really called for .
Maybe a war reduction first then we can talk about cutting troops .
But positioning another battle fleet by Iran while the tentative outcasting of US troops by Iraq has left over 23000 soldiers in Kuwait plus more in neighboring countries because nobody believes we will be gone long does not signal a promising end to wars in the middle east .
Why would we shift our views to asia ie china and russia when they pose no threat and our naval and air superiority are not in question ?
I love it when Liberals claim they "@ care @" about the military .
Fucking laughable .
We need to expand and take better care of our Military , not gut it and decrease it , not having enough Troops on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan is why things got so fucked up in those places to begin with , we did n't have enough troops to everywhere we needed to be to provide security and we left pockets of those countries open for the insurgents to control .
With the end of Vietnam most elements of the Military were slightly pared down , but not as would have normally occurred because of the ongoing Cold War with Russia .
Bush I started a a major gut of the military and intelligence capabilities after the Cold War ( supposedly ) ended which was continued ( and accelerated ) under Clinton .
9 / 11 and all subsequent actions afterwards dramatically increased the military and intelligence communities and now that 's winding down the paring starts all over again .
We have always followed this route , hell after the Civil War the Federal Army alone went from 1.5 million men to 30,000 almost overnight .
The same growth , paring process happened with WWI , WWII and Korea .

31 Americans , 7 Afghans killed in helicopter crash
By SOLOMON MOORE · Associated Press
KABUL , Afghanistan ( AP ) -- A military helicopter crashed in eastern Afghanistan , killing 31 U.S. special operation troops and seven Afghan commandos , the country 's president said Saturday .
An American official said it was apparently shot down , in the deadliest single incident for American forces in the decade @-@ long war .
The Taliban claimed they downed the helicopter with rocket fire while it was taking part in a raid on a house where insurgents were gathered in the province of Wardak late Friday .
It said wreckage of the craft was strewn at the scene .
NATO confirmed the overnight crash took place and that there "@ was enemy activity in the area . @"
But it said it was still investigating the cause and conducting a recovery operation at the site .
It did not release details or casualty figures .
"@ We are in the process of accessing the facts , @" said U.S. Air Force Capt. Justin Brockhoff , a NATO spokesman .
But a senior U.S. administration official in Washington said it was apparently shot down by insurgents .
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the crash is still being investigated .
President Barack Obama mourned the deaths of the American troops , saying in a statement that the crash serves as a reminder of the "@ extraordinary sacrifices @" being made by the U.S. military and its families .
He said he also mourned "@ the Afghans who died alongside our troops . @"
The death toll would surpass the worst single day loss of life for the U.S. @-@ led coalition in Afghanistan since the war began in 2001 - the June 28 , 2005 downing of a military helicopter in eastern Kunar province .
In that incident , 16 Navy SEALs and Army special operations troops were killed when their craft was shot down while on a mission to rescue four SEALs under attack by the Taliban .
Three of the SEALs being rescued were also killed and the fourth wounded .
It was the highest one @-@ day death toll for the Navy Special Warfare personnel since World War II .
With its steep mountain ranges , providing shelter for militants armed with rocket @-@ propelled grenade launchers , eastern Afghanistan is hazardous terrain for military aircraft .
Large , slow @-@ moving air transport carriers like the CH-47 Chinook are particularly vulnerable , often forced to ease their way through sheer valleys where insurgents can achieve more level lines of fire from mountainsides .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Saturday gave the first public word of the new crash , saying in a statement that "@ a NATO helicopter crashed last night in Wardak province @" and that 31 American special operations troops were killed .
He expressed his condolences to President Barack Obama .
The helicopter was a twin @-@ rotor Chinook , said an official at NATO headquarters in Brussels .
The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said he was receiving his information from an Afghan officer in Kabul .
The crash took place in the Sayd Abad district of Wardak province , said a provincial government spokesman , Shahidullah Shahid .
The volatile region borders the province of Kabul where the Afghan capital is located and is known for its strong Taliban presence .
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said in a statement that Taliban fighters downed the helicopter during a "@ heavy raid @" in Sayd Abad .
He said NATO attacked a house in Sayd Abad where insurgent fighters were gathering Friday night .
During the battle , the fighters shot down the helicopter , killing 31 Americans and seven Afghans , he said , adding that eight insurgents were killed in the fight .
There have been at least 17 coalition and Afghan aircraft crashes in Afghanistan this year .
Most of the crashes were attributed to pilot errors , weather conditions or mechanical failures .
However , the coalition has confirmed that at least one CH-47F Chinook helicopter was hit by a rocket propelled grenade on July 25 .
Two coalition crew members were injured in that attack .
Meanwhile , in the southern Helmand province , an Afghan government official said Saturday that NATO troops attacked a house and inadvertently killed eight members of a family , including women and children .
NATO said that Taliban fighters fired rocket propelled grenades and small arms fire at coalition troops during a patrol Friday in the Nad Ali district .
"@ Coalition forces responded with small arms fire and as the incident continued , an air strike was employed against the insurgent position , @" said Brockhoff .
He added that NATO sent a delegation to meet with local leaders and investigate the incident .
Nad Ali district police chief Shadi Khan said civilians died in the bombardment but that it was unknown how many insurgents were killed .
Helmand , a Taliban stronghold , is the deadliest province in Afghanistan for international troops .
NATO has come under harsh criticism in the past for accidentally killing civilians during operations against suspected insurgents .
However , civilian death tallies by the United Nations show the insurgency is responsible for most war casualties involving noncombatants .
In south Afghanistan , NATO said two coalition service member were killed , one on Friday and another on Saturday .
The international alliance did not release further details .
With the casualties from the helicopter crash , the deaths bring to 365 the number of coalition troops killed this year in Afghanistan and 42 this month .

Man , that 's a lot .
I did n't realize the casualties were that high this year .

It seems like it had to be an inside job .
The Afghans had to be involved .
I do n't believe in coincidences .

How did this happen ?
How did the Taliban know where to find these guys ?
This smells of an inside job for sure .
Afghans had to be involved in revealing the location of this chopper .
A slight disagreement .
The war in Afghanistan was completely necessary .
If a mistake was made there , it was when the Bush administration diverted our military forces to Iraq in 2003 before the Afghan war as wrapped up .
Now we are almost having to start over again there .
It is important that we do the job right so we do n't have to go back in 5 or 10 years .
Not trying to be disrespectful at all , but @...
My dad was in the Coast Guard .
He said it was his way of draft dodging during Vietnam .
But he did boot camp , served , swabbed the deck , carried a weapon , arrested people for illegal fishing , stuff like that .
He still whistles the Coast Guard tune .
Coast Guard not actually in the Department of Defense @...
it was part of the Department of Transportation ( ! ) and now , Homeland Security .
I trust the Coast Guard is rough and ready .
They guarded me every time I went to work across New York Harbor !
But honestly , if someone is trying to be a bad-ass , I figure they go for the Marines , Army 's Delta Force or Special Forces , etc. If not , well , Air Force .
Though I knew a guy who joined the Air Force so he could join their rescue team , reputed to be pretty incredible .
Personally , I did n't finish Boy Scouts .
Just thought it was cool that two of them are SEALs .
Highly unique military circumstance .
Interservice rivalry aside , the Coast Guard has some jobs that are as tough as any special operations duty , and can get you killed , whether you get shot at , or not .
The Coast Guard Rescue Swimmer school has a typical attrition rate exceeding 50 % , and it would n't surprise me if some of them were able to get through BUDS and become SEALs . ; a lot of the mental and physical skills required are similar .
The Coast Guard has about 300 Rescue Swimmers deployed world wide , and you 'd be surprised at some of the things they do routinely .
( It sure includes some things this former airborne infantry grunt would not particularly care to attempt . )
You gotta wonder why Joyce would disrespect his own father 's service .
Things might have changed but as recent as the late 90 s if you were from another branch of service and completed all the training you had to resign from that service and join the Navy in order to be a SEALs team member .
CG Rescue Swimmers are as bad ass as they come .

Okay , this apparently is the POV you hold .
The rest of the post you made contains the regrets and hindsight of men and women involved in the decision to use the A-Bomb on Japan @....
and I have no trouble believing they carried a powerful sense of conflict and regret over that choice till they died .
They would not have been human if they did not .
I seem to recall even Einstein regretted invention of the A-Bomb .
But emotion alone does not control the questions of ethics and the A-Bomb .
Personally I think it is irrelevant whether or not Japan had a "@ superior economic / political system @" to the US 's in 1945 .
I do n't happen to believe that they did , but either side in a war seeks conquest .
I like to think at least some military people place ethical limits on their warfare behavior .
In that vein , what I am asking is this @:
* Was the A-Bomb a useful weapon ?
Did the war end faster because we unleashed it on Japan ?
* Why was it necessary to drop TWO A-Bombs ?
And most urgently @:
* Did humans learn anything from the A-Bombing of Japan that military types today can or should reflect upon before firing off the nuclear weapons in their arsenals ?
ill bet your dad was relieved it was over .
if Truman had not dropped it and he ( your dad ) died then your family found he had a weapon that could have ended it , they would have wanted Truman drawn and quatered .
also you would n't be here today !!!!
the Jap Army did not believe we had more that one weapon .
also they were starving their own people to stay in the fight .
Japanese generals did not believe we had more than one A-Bomb ?
That seems incredible @...
almost suicidal .
If I were Japanese , I 'd be hating on those generals .
Civilians should not be cannon fodder without reason .
Is n't surrender required ( ethically ) when civilian lives are at stake ?
Yeah , we should drop the bomb on those with whom we are no longer at war .
the Japs were more brutal than the Nazi 's

Would anyone like to correct his error in thinking ?
I could explain about learning from history , but I do n't think Si modo can take in any data from chicks .
Truman based his decision on the actions of the Japanese at okinawa , Iwo , and Tarawa .
Civilian casualties were respectively 60 % , 95 % and 90 % .
US casualties , while lower than Japanese casualties , were severe and the battles protracted .
Iwo is a very small rock , but it took two months to clear .
They were budgeting 2 US deaths per square mile .
I have no problem with using the bomb to end it .
The original target was Germany because there was good reason to believe the Germans would come up with the bomb if we did n't .
( The were too pig headed and blinded by ideology to do so , lucky for us ) It was in Germany that the first big breakthroughs came .
I think the Manhatten project was a waste of resources .
They should have spent the resources more wisely .
but having built it , and given the goofiness and intransigence of the Japanese government , using it was the best way to end the war .
the Japs were trying to build their own Abomb .
what if they had suceeded ???

HBO is running its series "@ The Pacific @" now , and I can hardly bear to watch .

The Japanese did not engage in systematic genocide with their army .
I know -- a little -- about things such as the Bataan Death March .
Thank God , Daddy was not a POW and came home in one piece , at least physically .
But are you really saying the Japanese Army deserved brutality from the US in a way that the German Army did not ?
It 's just hard to imagine any human evil will ever rival the Death Camps .
American POWs were treated well by the Germans .
They did n't @' go on suicide missions , and they would surrender .
What was happening to the Jews was separate from other war efforts , which the german soldiers likely did n't even know about while they were fighting the war .
Japanese tortured and abused POWs , if not straight up kill them .
THey killed and brutalized so many civilians in the lands they captured .
They were by far much more fucked up than the germans .
holocaust aside
In the context of the time and the number of people who had already been killed on both sides , I would say the first bomb was ethical to end the war .
I still can n't understand why it was necessary to drop a second bomb only three days later .
We had already made our point with Hiroshima @...
Nagasaki was overkill
READ the source documents .
After the first Bomb the Generals that ran the Government REFUSED to surrender .
The Emperor refused to act after the first bomb also .
It is all there .
The second bomb is what convinced the Emperor to order a surrender .
RetiredGySgt , in a rather lazy fashion repeatedly points to The National Security Archive 's collection of 77 documents on the atomic bomb and end of world war 2 saying '@ the proof is in there @' .
Rather like tossing a dictionary at a newspaper editor and saying '@ here 's tomorrow 's front page story @' .
So where in the comprehensive 77 lengthy sections could that magical , much sought @-@ after golden fleece @-@ like '@ good reason @' to consign the 350,000 civilian population of Hiroshima and the 250.000 civilian population of Nagasaki to the horrors of a nuclear blood bath be hiding ?
Perhaps it was Document 29 , where on 11 of July Foreign Minister Togo sent the following '@ extremely urgent @' message to Ambassador Sato @:
"@ We are now secretly giving consideration to the termination of the war because of the pressing situation which confronts Japan both at home and abroad Therefore , when you have your interview with Molotov [ in accordance with previous instructions ] you should not confine yourself to the objective of a rapprochement between Russia and Japan but should also sound him out on the extent to which it is possible to make use of Russia in ending the war . @"
and then on the same day @:
Japan @- as a proposal for ending the war and because of her concern for the establishment and maintenance of lasting peace - has absolutely no idea of annexing or holding the territories which she occupied during the war . @"
<a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/29.pdf"> http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/29.pdf </a>
These Documents reveal many desperate attempts by Japans envoys to establish a surrender up to the very end and on August 5 th ( Document 52 ) .
All the while U.S. interceptors secretly listened in , and made Truman 's office aware of the full content of these Japanese attempts yet they went ahead anyway , choosing to test one of each type of their new atomic devices , first Uranium , then Plutonium on the living Human guinea pigs ; the old men , the helpless women and innocent children behind enemy lines , away from the theatre of war , away from where the soldiers were .
America sneaked in , from a safe height and in cowards fashion dropped their devastating bombs on non combatants then ran away .
And as President Harry Truman ate his lunch on the Augusta with fellow mass murderers Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin , news of the bombing of Hiroshima came in . Jubilantly , he announced to the retinue of sailors around him @..
"@ This is the Greatest thing in History ! @"
( Heaped bodies after Hiroshima atomic @-@ bombing of civilian area . )
It has always bothered me that we bombed cities full of non @-@ whites , but not Germany , where the Death Camps existed .
Maybe the A-Bomb was not finished before VE Day .
Maybe .
But the US confined Japanaese Americans to internment camps and did NOT do so as to Italian Americans or German Americans .
It seems to me there must have been a tremendous temptation to drop the A-Bomb SOMEPLACE , just to show the world what we had .
Without using it in warfare , who would ever believe this gruesome weapon even existed ?
All these things , together with the second bombing , have made me uneasy .
I WANT to believe Truman 's decisions were ethically defensible .
His comments to those around him do not offend me .
It 's understandable that he wanted VJ Day at any cost .
But still the doubts persist -- that we bombed a couple of Asian cities and killed millions , instantly or later by radiation poisoning , because we COULD and not because we had no other choice .
I do n't know what my Daddy saw or knew .
I lost him when I was quite young , and like most WW II vets , he would never discuss what he 'd been through .
But my Mommy and Daddy were pinkos .
They sympathesized with or actually joined the American Communist Party .
I rather think if he 'd been all good with Truman 's decisions , Daddy would not have been such a radical after the war .
waste of time on that asshat .
Quartermass has not given opinion in that last post , namvet .
He recited facts .
Either he has the facts right or he does n't .
If he 's right , what use is it to go on pretending it was all good ?
that 's the point .
no reply to back up what he says .
he 's using the ole copy and paste trick .
come on .
he 's a troll .
First thing .
The Atomic Bombs were not ready until Summer 1945 .
Germany surrendered in April .
We had no reason to drop said bombs on Germany .
The reality is that it took BOTH bombs to get the Emperor of Japan to over ride his Army Controlled Government and order an immediate surrender .
With those bombs we would have starved Japan through the winter killing untold thousands followed by an Invasion of a Home Island which would have seen MILLIONS of dead Japanese civilians and soldiers .
Japan was teaching her civilians to arm themselves with Bamboo spears and human wave charge any invasion .
The continued invasion of Japan could have seen the potential elimination of the Japanese race .
The lie that Japan was ready to surrender is revisionist history .
Japan under the Army had no intention of surrender .
What they "@ offered @" through the Soviet Union was a cease fire with Japan keeping everything she still possessed and the return of Japanese home possessions like Saipan and Okinawa .
Japan was offering to let us just stop attacking them .
They would retain all of their Chinese , Korean and other possessions and we would return their home island captures .
Here is a link to SOURCE documents verifying that Japan was NOT offering a meaningful surrender , that even after two atomic Bombs the Army controlled government refused to surrender , that the Emperor failed to act until after the second atomic bomb and that the Army attempted a Coup to prevent the Emperor from surrendering .
<a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/index.htm"> The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II @: A Collection of Primary Sources </a>
The atomic bombs were necessary unless one thinks we should have just let Japan keep everything from before the war and not disarm .
They SAVED millions of lives .
You 're full of shit .
The proof is not in what you stated , it is what you completely avoided .
There are two simple yet often overlooked fundamental aspects that prove the bombs were not meant to get Japan to surrender .
( 1 ) We had their offer to surrender before we dropped the bombs .
It was the same offer we accepted after we targeted civilians with the A-bombs and dropped them .
( 2 ) The bombs were not dropped to intimidate Japan .
There were dropped to intimidate Russia .
Midcan makes a good point .
If you are one of the dead , how it happened is no longer of any interest .
We did have the history of the way the Japanese were fighting .
We were looking at civilian casualties in the range of 65 @-@ 95 % For the living on both sides , the bomb was a lifesaver .
But we are n't ever going to fight a war with an enemy like that again .
And we have never fought a war in that manner since .
The reasons the cliche "@ The bombs saved lives @" are many of the same reasons Bush supporters were reduced to defending Bush by saying "@ History will prove him correct . @"
Well , it 's been a year .
What say you ?
He still seems like a lying fuckwhit to me .
And the sad thing is , while he lied about Iraq having the A-Bomb , it now appears he failed to stop IRAN from getting it .
Oh joy .
It 's been a few years .
Do we still need undiluted jingoism in everyone or else they 're a troll ?
Germany surrendered before the nukes were ready but even if that were not the case we would not have used them in Europe because Russia did not pose the same threat for post @-@ War in Europe as in Japan .
Regarding death camps , we did n't bomb those because as a Nation we were anti @-@ Semitic to the point that many quietly thanked the implementation of the final solution .
We even turned away Jewish refugees seeking asylum in the US who were eventually killed by Germany .
Some claimed we did n't know about them and even if we knew we had no way to get bombers to their locations due to distance .
Bullshit .
There are ariel photos showing we were bombing around the gas chambers .
There are two main reasons we suddenly became pro @-@ Israel in 1945 .
The first was creating a nation in the ME the West could use as an entry point to resources in the region .
Keep in mind , about two generations before WW2 the British Empire created the nation of Iraq .
Literally , both by borders and name .
Maintaining control was very difficult with so much geographical isolation .
Enter Israel .
The West now has a geographical advantage but more importantly , it obtained a geopolitical goldmine that is still in use today .
The Japanese had several negotiated settlements on the table .
None of them conformed to the conditions set out and agreed to by the allies .
CurveLight , if this is the truth , then why has no bright lawyer ever sued the US on behalf of Japan for damages of one sort or another ?
You mean like we 've been paying off civilians in Vietnam , Iraq , Afghanistan etc. ?
Or like how Japan is paying off A-Bomb survivors ?
( not a typo @--@ yes .
Japan has been paying A-bomb survivors )
I would guess because it would n't get any traction .
A recent example is how a Federal court rejected a lawsuit based on "@ national security . @"
A German Citizen was kidnapped by the US , taken to secret prisons , and tortured before it was discovered he was completely innocent .
His whole hellish nightmare lasted for months .
Upon his release he sued the US for the above crimes and the case was dismissed for "@ National Security Reasons . @"
Without fact checking , I 'm confident in saying lawsuits have been attempted and denied .
The surrender offered by Japan prior to the bombs is the same surrender we accepted after the bombs .
and your full of it .
they refused any offer to surrender .
they were negotiating with Russia for one .
the bombs were dropped to end the war .
using science instead of American blood .
One of you is right and the other is wrong @...
on the facts .
Is there no good source document to go look @-@ see who 's right , namvet ?
Has there never been a proceeding in the Hague or any sort of international court ?
Over 5000 German Americans were arrested and confined , several thousand were not released until 1946 .
His facts SUPPORT what I told you .
The Japanese simply offered to end the war in place .
They would evacuate all territory captured after December 7 1941 and we would return all Territory held by them prior to Dec 7 1941 .
That simply was not going to happen .
It is idiotic to think it would happen .
Once again we did not have a functioning A bomb to drop on Germany before she surrendered and to tell you the truth we had no need to do so , they were not unreasonable fools like the Japanese .
We did however FIREBOMB most of their cities killing hundreds of thousands of Civilians .
how about documents on this .
from the Truman library archives .
there is no doc that says we offered or agreed to any surrender prior to the bombs .
it was still unconditional surrender !!!!
<a href="https://trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/bomb/large/index.php"> https://trumanlibrary.org/whistlesto...arge/index.php </a>
Straight up LIE .
Provide a single source to your claim the Japanese offered unconditional Surrender before the Emperor ordered it AFTER 2 Atomic Bombs .
I have in the source documents the actual meetings of the Japanese Government and their refusal to surrender after the first bomb and their refusal after the second until the Emperor intervened .
Bush never claimed Iraq had a bomb .
That is left wing lying at its finest .
As for stopping Iran , are you saying we were wrong for stopping Iraq from returning to research on the bomb by invading but we should have invaded Iran ?
You are a LIAR .
Provide a source document .
I have provided a SOURCE document of the Japanese Governments meetings and then did not offered to surrender at all before either bomb was dropped .
They offered through the Soviets to end the war in place exchanging territory they captured for territory we captured .
After the first bomb they offered much the same .
Provide us a link to a source document .
I GAVE you a link to SOURCE DOCUMENTS .
They INCLUDE the Japanese Governments meetings involving just this .
READ them .
After Japanese leaders flatly rejected the Potsdam Declaration President Truman authorized use of the atomic bomb anytime after August 3 , 1945 .
<a href="http://www.trumanlibrary.org/teacher/abomb.htm#docanal"> Atomic Bomb @-@ Truman Press Release @-@ August 6 , 1945 </a>
This is what I mean .
Either this is an accepted , established historical fact or it is n't .
We should n't be debating WHAT happened .
I thought we KNEW what happened .
I 'm very confused by these different scenarios you guys present .
If we A-Bombed Japan needlessly , it was not ethical .
Or was it ?
Do we agree on that much ?
I say no .
Even though we benefitted from the object lesson / demonstration of US military power , the use of the A-Bomb -- TWICE -- just to flex our post @-@ war muscles was not ethical , if it was not ALSO necessary to force Japan to surrender .
Madeline there were millions of American lives at stake here .
you make the call .
kill the enemy or you own ? .
then YOU have to face the the suriving families .
who will call you a murderer .
which is it ????
Personally , I do n’t think without the dramatic blow of the atomic drops many Japanese military units would have surrendered even if the Emperor had told them to .
The military often dictated terms to the government , they had large armies undefeated in China , mass killing civilians every day , they might have just fought on dragging the war out and costing everyone more life , ( an invasion of Japan would have cost far more life than the drops on both sides ) and allowing the Soviets to expand their sphere of influence in Asia .
Indeed there was a plot to Kamikaze attack the surrender ceremony on the USS Missouri that was stopped by the Emperor ’s son , ( John Toland , The Rising Sun ) so even after the drops there were hard core elements willing to fight on .
The drops ( Japan did not know how many more bombs we had ) made resistance of any kind almost unthinkable .
Also , how does President Truman tell a parent your son died , even in a war prolonged by days or weeks , and I had a weapon that could have ended the war immediately but did not use it .
He could n’t .
The drops also certainly put a break on Soviet ambitions , they had to think and be cautious about gobbling up territory in the direct post war chaos .
They probably stopped an immediate military conflict with the Soviet Union .
agreed !!!!
ests were a million American dead in the invasion .
ests were always wrong .
probably more like 3 or 4 times that number .
this weighed heavily on Trumans mind .
drop em .
You are arguing the wrong point .
There was no surrender on the table before the A Bombs were dropped .
The ONLY thing the Japanese offered was a cease of hostilities and the return of captured territory .
They would hand over what ever they still had from after Dec 7 and we would hand over what ever of theirs we had from before Dec 7 .
It is a bald faced LIE that the same surrender existed before as after and that we ignored it to bomb them .
My link is to SOURCE documents .
We have the actual conversations from the Japanese Government .
Call me selfish , but if it saved even just one American life , I 'd have dropped the A-Bomb myself .
I am not asking for a pie @-@ in @-@ the @-@ sky ethical debate .
I merely want to know , was it necessary or not ?
Had Japan surrendered BEFORE we bombed there ?
RetiredGySgt says he can prove they did NOT , that he has source documents to back up his position .
Well , is there any doubt that he does ?
Is there some question about these documents ?
This is why there should have been a court proceeding .
I am just mystified as to why none was ever conducted .

I posted that link because it has a compilation from MAGIC that tells a different story from the Trumanesque Romanticism of using the bombs .
Apologists say it was necessary to use the bombs to get Japan to surrender unconditionally .
That 's bullshit because even after the bombs Japan did not give an unconditional surrender .
After using the bombs it was not Japan that compromised on the conditions of surrender .
It was the US .
Think about it .

seems you do n't read what you post .
its obvious you deal in fiction and theories .
im finished with you
He is LYING .
I have provided you with SOURCE documents .
The actual conversations that occurred in the Japanese Governments meetings about Surrender , and after the A bombs .
The ONLY thing the Japanese offered before the A Bombs was a cease fire to move their troops from captured territory while we removed our troops from captured territory .
We demanded an unconditional Surrender just as we did in Germany .
The Only concession we final relinquished on was allowing the Emperor to remain the Emperor .
Go ahead , I have provided the actual conversations of the Japanese Government , he has offered nothing .
Ask him for evidence .
You just admitted we accepted a conditional surrender from Japan .
If we were willing to accept a conditional surrender , the same one offered prior to the bombs , then why did n't we ?
Here are some links for you to ignore @:

Dumb ass .
Go argue your retarded lies somewhere else .
Once again I have source documents of the JAPANESE Government and the US Government .
The Japanese never offered to surrender .
Further the Emperor surrendered unconditionally , WE made the choice to allow him to remain Emperor .
The fact you are either ignorant or dishonest about such a well known fact shows your gross inability to debate the issue .
Japan did not offer an unconditional surrender after the bombs @:
"@ On August 10 , 1945 , Japan offered to surrender to the Allies , the only condition being that the emperor be allowed to remain the nominal head of state . @"

RetiredGySgt , I watched Bush on television saying that Iraq had "@ weapons of mass destruction @" .
I HOPED he meant the A-Bomb @....
chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction scared me stiff .
HE LIED about that and sat around twiddling his thumbs whilst IRAN acquired nuclear technology .
I despise Bush .
I think he and Cheney should be arrested as traitors .
Some of my friends have kidlets in active duty over in Iraq and Afganistan @...
all because of GWB 's lies and Cheney 's greed to score big contracts from the Dept. of Defense .
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMStCHtUNeY"> YouTube - George @: Saddam Hussein Has Weapons of Mass Destruction </a>
How can any patriot defend GWB ?
Bush was right .
According to everything we and the rest of the world knew Saddam Hussein HAD Biological and Chemical weapons .
He never accounted for them and we knew he had them .
Further his dual use facilities allowed him the ability to make more .
Provide a single clip ANYWHERE where Bush EVER made a claim Saddam Hussein had nukes .
You will n't find one .
What we were worried about and rightfully so , was that once sanctions were lifted he would only be a couple years away from a bomb .
Captured documents PROVE that is true .
Bush nor Cheney lied to anyone , that is left wing propaganda and outright lies .
Read the Congressional consent to use force .
Bush was very clear why we were going into Iraq .
We have had Democrats in control of both houses of Congress since Jan 2007 , they PROMISED if we elected them they would provide proof Bush lied and that he broke laws .
It is now 2010 and no such charges have ever been brought forward .
In fact EVERY Commission Republican and Democrat that investigated the issue has ruled Bush did NOT LIE .
A quality debate on GWB would take some digging on my part -- flinging POVs will n't do any good without facts .
If you 'd like to , we can start a new thread on him .
I did n't mean to hijack this one @..
I was enjoying the tutoring by you guys on WW II and VJ Day .
My apologies .
You 're quite the dumbass for ignoring what I said @:
"@ I posted that link because it has a compilation from MAGIC that tells a different story from the Trumanesque Romanticism of using the bombs . @"
I do n't know and do n't care what else is on the site .
The information for MAGIC is independently verifiable .
Looks to me like you know you can not defend your position so you seek a way out , however dishonest , rather than stand your ground .
I still do not understand how such a HUGELY significant historical fact can be in doubt , this many years later .
CurveLight @: what exactly about RetiredGySgt 's documents makes them less than reliable in your view ?
RetiredGySgt @: why are CurveLight 's documents unreliable ?
Are you claiming they have been altered ?
They are not authentic ?
What ?
You just CAN NOT both be right on the FACTS .
It 's logically impossible .
He is playing with words .
The Japanese made the following offer through the Soviet Union @...
They would cease hostilities and we would cease hostilities .
They would evacuate all territory captured since Dec 7 1941 and we would evacuate all territory that was Japanese before Dec 7 1941 .
Further no other action would occur to Japan .
No foreign presence in Japan , no reorganization of their Government , no dismantling of their military .
We refused .
After the First Atomic Bomb they floated a similar plan and we again refused .
After the second Bomb the Emperor intervened in the Governments deliberations .
The Army which controlled the Government absolutely REFUSED to surrender .
Even after 2 Atomic Bombs .
The Emperor over ruled them and ordered an immediate UNCONDITIONAL Surrender .
Curvelight is pretending that the offer to a cease of hostilities was a offer to surrender .
He is further claiming that because we eventually allowed the Emperor to remain as a figure head in Japan we should not have dropped the bombs .
He is using the same intercepts as my source documents and claiming they do not clearly say what they say .
Further I have in my source documents the actual meetings of the Japanese Government and what was and was not agreed to .
Who wanted and did not want Peace .
The Army ran the Government and was not going to surrender .
Even after the Emperor agreed to surrender the Army staged a coup and tried to seize the voice recording where the Emperor ordered the surrender and prevent the Emperor from further addressing the Nation .
Well , CurveLight , what say you ?
If RetiredGySgt is right then the POV you and Quartermass have posted here seems less than completely intellectually honest to me .
If RetiredGySgt is correct on the FACTS , then as far as I am concerned , he is right on the ETHICS as well .
This business of flinging URLs around is n't getting us anywhere , CurveLight .
WHAT exactly is defective about the documents relied on by RetiredGySgt and namvet ?
Why are THEY not good evidence of what transpired ?
Are the doctored ?
Are they incomplete ?
Is there doubt about their authenticity ?
I just posted the evidence Japan did not offer an unconditional surrender but you want to claim I 'm ignorant of the facts ?
Lol @...
No to all those questions .
He even uses magic intercepts for his claims .
He is twisting the information and in some cases outright lying .
But what is the point if you refuse to even read the documents ?
I have glanced through all the URLs , sir .
Each seems to support the factual allegations the posters have claimed they would .
But BOTH scenarios can not have occurred , and at this point , I am kinda sorta thinking this is as far as I 'm gonna get .
I 'm heavily inclined to believe what you have posted , RetiredGySgt , but I still have some doubts .
More or less the same place I was in when this thread started .
The question of the bombs @' role was not in trying to figure out how to end WW2 .
They were used to figure out how to start what became known as The Cold War .
Oh yeah , that makes a lot of sense @......
You could not think of any better way to demonstrate what an idiot you are .
You 're one of many who lack basic knowledge about the end of WW2 .
The bombs were used to prevent Japan from surrendering through a deal with Russia .
Why ?
The US would have had to share the spoils of war and we were not about to do that .
Also , we were never really allies with Russia as our only common goal was defeating the third Reich in Europe .
But feel free to continue calling people an idiot because they say something beyond your comprehension capabilities .
It makes you look oh so cool !
Excusatio non petita , accusatio manifesta
Shircia , fov huzy deramia !
Once again you fucking MORON I have the meetings from the Japanese Government .
They were never going to surrender to the allies before the A bombs and there were no deals to surrender to the Soviets as the Japanese did not believe they would attack them .
The info they are pointing to is an incomplete picture .
In many ways , what you are saying about both scenarios being impossible to co @-@ exist is exactly what was taking place .
There was the "@ official @" position that the nukes were the only way to force japan to an unconditional surrender then there was the more factual position that japan was trying to surrender .
In both countries there was a power struggle between the military and civilian leadership , but their agendas were in role reversals .
In Japan the civilian side was more apt to seeking peace than the military but in the US it was the military that was pushing for peace more than the civilian leadership under Truman .
In regards to your OP question about the "@ necessity @" of the bombs , what does it tell you that every top US military leader has agreed that the bombs were not necessary ?
And yet you IGNORE the fact that until the second Atomic Bomb was dropped the Japanese had NO INTENTION of surrendering and even after the second attack it took direct intervention from the Emperor to force the Army to surrender .
Once again pea brain the Japanese never offered to surrender .
The offer to the Soviets to intercede for them with the allies was NOT a surrender .
And after the first bomb they made no credible offer either .
I have the FACTS to back me up .
The meetings of the Japanese Government .
"@ This memo showed that the Japanese were offering surrender terms virtually identical to the ones ultimately accepted by the Americans at the formal surrender ceremony on September 2 -- that is , complete surrender of everything but the person of the Emperor . @"

Have you never realized the Potsdam Declaration was designed to inhibit Japan 's surrender so the a-bombs could be used ?
No wonder you are such an idiot @: Poor , poor Curvey believes
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Elmer_Barnes"> Harry Elmer Barnes </a> whose career as a professor and then as a journalist was aborted by his contentiousness and his cavalier disregard not only for accuracy but also for truth .
He produced no original scholarly work but synthesized information from his vast reading in a series of prolix and repetitious works on the history of Western civilization .
Was it ethical to use the A-bomb on the Japanese ?
If so , was it ethical to bomb both Hiroshima and Nagasaki ?
I do not know what is ethical about war .
I have never considered the ethics of war .
I doubt if any soldier even considers this .
His main concern is necessity and self preservation .
As to the dropping of the first a bomb @...
I wonder if any Jap wrote a poem about the excessive sunburn that the population of Hiroshima experienced ?
Indeed , that which was of the Sun did shine on the Land of the Rising Sun @............
But there are warfare ethics , are n't there ?
Do n't we have them laid out in the Geneva Convention ?
Do n't we teach them at the Naval Academy , etc. ?
So the documents relied on by CurveLight are suspect , Samson ?
I have to admit , I hope that you and RetiredGySgt and namvet are right , and Quartermass and CurveLight are wrong .
This country has enough to feel shame over without a gratitutous A-Bombing or two to add to that black list .
Curvey 's only resource is some nut @-@ case @-@ historical @-@ revisionist .
Please check your InBox .
I 'm grateful to you , and so you have a present .
I never referenced barnes as a source you lying fuck .
So you 're relying on Samson to tell you my sources instead of asking me ?
How much sense does that make ?
One source is an article from August 1945 @:
"@ In an article that finally appeared August 19 , 1945 , on the front pages of the Chicago Tribune and the Washington Times @-@ Herald , Trohan revealed that on January 20 , 1945 , two days prior to his departure for the Yalta meeting with Stalin and Churchill , President Roosevelt received a 40 @-@ page memorandum from General Douglas MacArthur outlining five separate surrender overtures from high @-@ level Japanese officials .
( The complete text of Trohan 's article is in the Winter 1985 @-@ 86 Journal , pp. 508 @-@ 512 . ) @"
Samson claimed my "@ only resource @" is barnes when in fact I 've never referenced barnes at all .
So you just thanked Samson for outright lying .
Madeline , have you ever responded to the fact our top military leaders all agreed the bombs were not necessary ?
Curvelight 's "@ source @" is Mark Weber 's IHR Article .
Let 's see what Good Ol @' Mark is all about , shall we ?
Mark Weber @:
<a href="http://www.adl.org/holocaust/weber.asp"> The Professional Denier </a>
More than any other propagandist , Mark Weber , 45 , embodies the Holocaust @-@ denial movement .
An articulate , media @-@ savvy spokesperson with a master 's degree in History from Indiana University , Weber got his start in the radical right in 1978 , when he took the position of news editor for National Vanguard , a publication of the neo @-@ Nazi National Alliance .
In 1979 , Weber also began to contribute regularly to The Spotlight , a weekly
tabloid produced by Willis Carto 's Liberty Lobby organization .
His involvement with the IHR also intensified steadily over the years ; initially working as a contributor to the now @-@ defunct IHR Newsletter , Weber began serving as emcee for the group 's annual conventions in 1984 .
In 1985 he became a member of IHR 's Editorial Advisory Committee and in 1992 he became editor of the Journal of Historical Review .
Following IHR 's break with Carto and the subsequent departure of most professional staff members in 1993 , Weber became director of the organization with one professional staff person serving under him .
Ahh , yes .
Only those as hopelessly stupid as Curvey would use Weber as a resource .
Maybe he has a National Enquirer Article he 'd like to present with more credability ?
Perhaps some Alien in the form of Elvis has an opinion about Ethics and The A-Bomb that Curvey would like to share !!
What Journal is this CurveLight ?
Now I am determined to know what the fuck is the deal with these competing documents .
Give us the complete citation and I will ask my research librarian to pull it for me .
Thankies .
CurveLight , I am not the arbiter here .
All USMB @-@ ers get to have the same weight given their opinions .
I 'm just asking questions because I 'm dumbfounded that there is ( apparently ) disagreement as to the historical facts .
Well CurveLight ?
Is this true ?
You 've relied on reporting by a discredited man ?
Weber is not my source either you dumbfuck .
That 's the second time you 've falsely accused a source I 've not used .
But you want to call others stupid @......
lol .
It is an indisputable historical fact that the top US military leaders agreed the bombs were not necessary .
What do you think about that fact ?
I 'm beginning to doubt the sincerity of your OP since you have side stepped this at least 4 times .
You have no leg to stand on .
Japan NEVER made an attempt to surrender before the Atomic Bombs .
The only thing they did is offer through the Soviets to a cease fire and a return to pre war borders .
They would vacate all captured territory that had from after Dec 1941 and we would evacuate all Japanese territory captured that was owned by them prior to Dec 1941 .
That is the ONLY offer made .
Poor , poor foolish curvey , linked to Mark Weber 's IHR article , and does n't even understand who he 's quoting @....
They were wrong .
Once again the Japanese had no intention of surrendering .
Even after 2 atomic Bombs the Army which controlled the Government REFUSED to surrender .
"@ Indesputable fact @"
Like the Holocaust , huh ?
Your sources also claim that it did NOT happen .
Idiot .
Or , they never agreed to any such thing @: Curvey 's source is bogus @: You may as well be arguing with someone that claims it was an "@ Indesputable fact @" that Martians agreed the A bombs were not necessary , and quotes an article from the National Enquirer .
I do n't give a damned if it was ethical or not .
it ended the war and saved millions of AMERICAN lives .
bottom line for me .
and i not going with this innocent civilian crap .
they were working in factory 's and making weapons to kill us .
the Japs murdered million of women and children in occupied countries .
or do we let that slide ???
they got what they deserved .
"@ I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve . @"
fleet Admiral Yamamoto after the Pearl Harbor attack
Yes , women and children died in the Phillipines and elsewhere .
They ALSO died in Germany , at the hands and bombs of the Allies .
Civilians in battlefields do die .
If the Japanese Army engaged in widespread genocide of the peoples of the Pacific Islands , I have not heard that .
Genocide in / by Germany yes , but Japan no .
But since when are unarmed civilians , especially children , cannon fodder ?
How many infants died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki , namvet ?
What weapons did they help manufacture ?
What sort of warfare ethics AIMS to kill civilians ?
The POV I take is that if we ONLY dropped the A-Bomb to show off our shiney new weapon to scare the Russians , etc. , it was wrong .
If we did it to force the surrender of Japan , it was right .
oh my . well that means your did n't watch the vid on unit 731 .
i put that up for you to prove this .
this is the last i can do to prove it

you did hear about the holocaust ????
and their being murdered as i type this .
come on Madeline .
everything the military need to fight a war .
then the generals and admirals decided who to use it on .

A former ambassador to Japan , Grew ’s knowledge of Japanese politics and culture informed his critical stance toward the concept of unconditional surrender .
He believed it essential that the United States declare its intention to preserve the institution of the emperor .
As he argued in this memorandum to President Truman , “@ failure on our part to clarify our intentions @” on the status of the emperor “@ will insure prolongation of the war and cost a large number of human lives . @” Documents like this have played a role in arguments developed by Alperovitz that Truman and his advisers had alternatives to using the bomb such as modifying unconditional surrender and that anti @-@ Soviet considerations weighed most heavily in their thinking .

Straight up LIE .
The Japanese NEVER offered a surrender .
They offered an end to hostilities .
You are either lying or a fool .
Even after the first bomb they never offered to surrender .
The Army ran the Government and REFUSED to surrender .
Even after 2 bombs they REFUSED to surrender .
The only reason they did surrender is because the Emperor intervened .
They are lying AND they are fools .

This review of Japanese capabilities and intentions portrays an economy and society under “@ tremendous strain @” ; nevertheless , “@ the ground component of the Japanese armed forces remains Japan ’s greatest military asset . @” Alperovitz sees statements in this estimate about the impact of Soviet entry into the war and the possibility of a conditional surrender involving survival of the emperor as an institution as more evidence that the policymakers saw alternatives to nuclear weapons use .
By contrast , Richard Frank takes note of the estimate ’s depiction of the Japanese army ’s terms for peace @: “@ for surrender to be acceptable to the Japanese army it would be necessary for the military leaders to believe that it would not entail discrediting the warrior tradition and that it would permit the ultimate resurgence of a military in Japan . @” That , Frank argues , would have been “@ unacceptable to any Allied policy maker @” .

Excerpts from the Foreign Ministry 's compilation about the end of the war show how news of the bombing reached Tokyo as well as how Foreign Minister 's Togo initially reacted to reports about Hiroshima .
When he learned of the atomic bombing from the Domei News Agency , Togo believed that it was time to give up and advised the cabinet that the atomic attack provided the occasion for Japan to surrender on the basis of the Potsdam Declaration .
Togo could not persuade the cabinet , however , and the Army wanted to delay any decisions until it had learned what had happened to Hiroshima .
When the Foreign Minister met with the Emperor , Hirohito agreed with him ; he declared that the top priority was an early end to the war , although it would be acceptable to seek better surrender terms @--@ probably U.S. acceptance of a figure @-@ head emperor @--@ if it did not interfere with that goal .
In light of those instructions , Togo and Prime Minister Suzuki agreed that the Supreme War Council should meet the next day .
[ 42 a ]
An entry from Admiral Tagaki 's diary for August 8 conveys more information on the mood in elite Japanese circles after Hiroshima , but before the Soviet declaration of war and the bombing of Nagasaki .
Seeing the bombing of Hiroshima as a sign of a worsening situation at home , Tagaki worried about further deterioration .
Nevertheless , his diary suggests that military hard @-@ liners were very much in charge and that Prime Minister Suzuki was talking tough against surrender , by evoking last ditch moments in Japanese history and warning of the danger that subordinate commanders might not obey surrender orders .
The last remark aggravated Navy Minister Yonai who saw it as irresponsible .
That the Soviets had made no responses to Sato 's request for a meeting was understood as a bad sign ; Yonai realized that the government had to prepare for the possibility that Moscow might not help .
One of the visitors mentioned at the beginning of the entry was Iwao Yamazaki who became Minister of the Interior in the next cabinet .
Again Hardliners controlled the Government and had no intention of surrender even after the first atomic bomb .
The Emperor wanted better terms before he would agree .
Do you think you 're somehow disproving , or even arguing , with what I said ?
They were never willing to surrender unconditionally , I made that quite clear .
They were however willing to surrender with the sole condition that the Emperor retain his throne , we refused that sole condition , dropped two atomic bombs on their cities , and then allowed the Emperor to retain his throne anyway .
That is a lie , they demanded 4 conditions .
After the second bomb and the Soviet attack the Emperor changed it to one condition .
Prior to the Atomic bombs they only offered a cease fire and return to Dec 1941 borders .
I was fully prepared for you to try and jump on that and had Leahy 's quote from his book ready to use in response .
What you fail to understand is his prediction that it would not go off has absolutely nothing to do with the fact he said the bombs were not necessary .
Quentin already posted Leahy 's quote so I do n't need to .
So will you respond to the fact our top military leaders all agreed the bombs were not necessary or will you continue to be dishonest and claim I 'm citing sources I 've not cited ?
Wait @....
are n't you the same person that had no idea of the significance the bombs had with Russia ?
Do you know what else happened on August 9 th , 1945 ?
From everything I 've read , and talking with people at my Grandpop 's lodge , this is the version I believe .
I think the Truman Administration did the right thing to save American lives as terrifying as it was .
Madeline ,
I purposefully cited half of Leahy 's quote because his prediction the bombs would not detonate have no bearing on his position they were not necessary .
There was no risk of a failed detonation whether the bombs worked or not .
If they did n't go off they would have simply looked like conventional duds .
It 's not like the Japanese military would have said "@ Look !
The nukes did n't go off ! @"
Although any poor sucker who would have opened a dud would not exactly be radiating with joy @.......
I can not get any pro @-@ bomb person to answer a couple of questions so maybe you can .
If we dropped the bombs to force an unconditional surrender , then why is it the US changed its surrender terms instead of Japan ?
Do you realize that after the bombs were dropped it was not Japan who changed their conditions for surrender but the US ?
If it was worth nuking two civilian populations to try and force an unconditional surrender then why did we give up ?
The nukes did n't change Japan 's terms for surrender so why did n't we invade ?
Why did n't we continue firebombing , blockades and air raids ?
The Emperor only agreed to the provision of a a surrender with him in control AFTER the first bomb , NOT before .
There is NO surrender agreement prior to the first atomic blast .
All they offered was to cease hostilities and return to the Dec 1941 lines .
Even after the first blast the Emperor did not FORCE the Army to give up .
He told them to continue to work for better terms .
they offered 4 terms which were rejected .
After the second Bomb and a Soviet Invasion the Army STILL refused to surrender .
It took the Emperor to intervene and even then the Army tried a Coup to stop him
Show us in the Potsdam Declaration where the Emperor 's disposition is stated upon agreement of surrender .
they wanted to surrender on their terms .
what was our offical policy ????
I have no idea .
Invasion would have cost American lives .
If it came down , as I understand it did , to American servicepeople dying or Japanese , it is a no brainer .
Remember Pearl Harbor .
You 're full of shit as I just posted the fact Japan offered the terms for surrender and we accepted .
Also @......
Leahy , Eisenhower , and Macarthur all stated the bombs were not necessary for a surrender .
Could you explain why we should believe you over them ?
Your facts and your documentation are wrong .
Check it out for your own creditability 's sake , curve .
What facts are wrong ?
If you know then you should have stated what they were and proven them wrong .
You ignored the earlier posting , so I moved it to here .
Because you have not bothered to read the declassified material from the 1945 strategic planning ops for the Japanese invasion that have been released in the last decade .
It turns out that Leahy , Eisenhower , and Macarthur were all wrong , and that Truman made the right decisio http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/wars_downfall3.htmln · .
Now did you really suggest that Japanese offered to surrender in January 1945 ?
Really ?
Oh , my .
Your argument is a false analogy .
Choose something more equivalent .
A land invasion may well not have succeeded .
The casualties were going to be incredible even if the Allied armies managed to consolidate beach heads , much less push inland .
The bombs were necessary .
There is no real argument about this anymore .
It 's one of those flat historical facts that is indisputable .
That must be why you work so hard to avoid simple questions .
Quentin posted a boat load of facts you people will n't even pretend to address .
If new facts invalidate the old facts , the discussion is over .
Starkey @: mutter bugret sherlock mutter onna bun mutter mutter gu gu ca ca ( the discussion is over )
He posted no facts .
He cl ; aimed as you have that Japan offered to surrender before the Atomic Bombs , that is a BALD FACED lie .
All Japan offered was to cease the war and return to the 1941 start lines .
And after one bomb they still demanded their terms be meet .
It took 2 bombs , a Soviet Invasion AND the DIRECT intervention of the Emperor to end the war .
Even then the Army attempted a Coup .
He posted no facts ?
Holy fuck .
Dishonest people like you should have to pay other posters .

Curve , you would make an ideal representive for this countries enemies .
It was understood at the time that unless the Japanese surrendered , we would lose as many as a half a million to a million of our fighting men to finally defeat the Japanese Empire .
And the Japanese were not going to surrender .
The citizenry was being trained in how to fight to the last man , woman and child .
It took the atomic bomb to prove to them that it was futile .
And even the first one did n't turn the trick .
Compared to how many of OUR soldiers @' lives were at stake -- not even counting the many fold MORE Japanese lives that would be lost -- the math alone underscores a tragic ( but real ) morality in going atomic .
A horrible , horrifying and wrenching decision by President Truman ?
Absolutely .
But immoral ?
Based on the quantification of human life , the decision was far more moral than the alternative .
This is the same exact line that 's been proven wrong on several levels .

You keep ignoring the fact Leahy clearly stated the bombs were not necessary for Japan to surrender .
Why ?
Because you are n't here to discuss anything .
You 're a parasite .
Your puerile and always ineffective effort at ad hominem has never bolstered even one of your ridiculous arguments and in this case it constitutes just another massive fail by you in your long line of massive fails .
We called for unconditional surrender and we got it the day AFTER we dropped the SECOND of the two atomic bombs .
That we chose to be even moderately magnanimous does n't change the equation at all .
Not even a tiny little bit .
The Japanese were permitted to keep their titular head , the Emperor .
We granted them that much .
But the unconditional surrender we had demanded came only when they saw clearly that we could completely destroy them .
( Ironically , the second atomic bomb was the last in our then very tiny "@ stockpile . @"
But thankfully , the enemy was in no position to realize this . )
I have not embarrassed me , you stupid PussyPuddle .
I embarrassed you , even if you remain too stupid and dishonest to recognize it or admit it .

All your pathetic attempts to contort it or twist it and lie your absurd ass off about it will never change it .

Now , of course , you being the abjectly and always dishonest lying cowardly pussy that you are will deny the plain words of the text , but the Instrument of Surrender signed by Japan ending WWII is really quite clear @:
We , acting by command of and on behalf of the Emperor of Japan , the Japanese Government and the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters , hereby accept the provisions in the declaration issued by the heads of the Governments of the United States , China , and Great Britain 26 July 1945 at Potsdam , and subsequently to by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , which four powers are hereafter referred to as the Allied Powers .
We hereby proclaim the unconditional surrender to the Allied Powers of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters and of all Japanese Armed Forces and all Armed Forces under Japanese control wherever situated .

End of story .
Straight up LIE .
Before the bombs Japan wanted us to agree to a cease fire and a return to our 1941 start lines .
They wanted no foreign presence in Japan , no Change of Government and no change of the Military .
After the first bomb they still tried to make demands they want 4 things only one of which was the Emperor .
After 2 bombs and a Soviet declaration of War they agreed to surrender and WE agreed to let them keep their Emperor as a FIGURE head only .
The final surrender was UNCONDITIONAL .
As evidenced by the Documents the Japanese signed .
You have yet to provide us with all the supposed surrender attempts by Japan in 1945 .
You keep making the claim but provide absolutely no evidence of such .
There is nothing that can be posted that you would pay attention to unless it appeared to re @-@ affirm your pre @-@ maturely developed position .
I 've already posted evidence that you flat out ignore but demand more @......
Targeting civilians or civilian population centers is always unethical ; using weapons of mass destruction makes the situation unimaginably worse from a moral standpoint .
By 1945 , Japan 's military had been crippled to the point of ineffectiveness .
A bombing campaign against strategic military and industrial targets could have been carried out with minimal casualties among the US military as well as among Japan 's civilian population .
One of the reasons the sites were chosen was based on creating an atomic barometer .
They needed to drop the bombs in places that were very much in tact to measure the damage and fall out .
That is exactly what happened @: two atomic bombs and the Soviet invasion ended the war with very little casualties to Americans .
No atomic bombs , no surrender .
You are now engaged in the immorality of stubbornness .
Your assertion has flatly been disproved .
You can n't admit it , which says very poorly about your character .
You have made a claim , that Japan offered to Surrender in 1945 NUMEROUS times before either bomb was dropped .
PROVE it .
The ONLY offer they ever made was through the Soviets and that was not a surrender it was a cease fire with a pullback to the 1941 Line for all sides .
And according to this offer nothing else would be done to the Japanese .
After the first bomb was dropped they made an offer with 4 demands .
We rejected it .
After the second bomb and the Soviet Declaration of War and Invasion Japan 's Emperor ordered an immediate surrender with no Conditions .
The Allies accepted and changed the term to keeping the Emperor as a FIGURE head .
Japan surrendered unconditionally .
This is rock solid proof you ignore facts you do n't like because I 've linked a government website showing japan offered a conditional surrender but you continue to ignore it @.....
like your twin Starkey .
Flatly disproved ?

you have ignored the government link I posted showing Japan 's offer of a surrender on one condition and we accepted .

you do n't even attempt to support your claims like saying all the top military leaders were wrong for saying the bomb was not necessary .

I suppose this type of callousness towards the slaughter of civilians should be expected from an avowed Zionist .
two atomic bombs and the Soviet invasion ended the war with very little casualties to Americans .
Baseless .
Nationality is an artificial distinction .
The location of a person 's birth does n't make his life any more or less valuable than his neighbor 's .
Hundreds of thousands were not vaporized in EITHER city dumb ass .
And yes the Two Bombs ended the Pacific War , with out them we would have been forced to Invade them .
CurveLight would never have been born .
hmmm
What a goof .
The nation states have superseded the Papacy and the Caliphate , and geography grounds an individual 's character and values system .
The proper course was taken about Nagasaki and Hiroshima .
Where is the evidence how many were saved by leaflets ?
You 're also glossing over the fact we targeted and killed countless civilians out of pure evil .
How sad , the Japanese died , I did not read all the posts in this thread so maybe the next fact has been covered , if so forgive me .
How about the hundreds of thousands of lives the USA saved in Nagasaki by dropping leaflets warning the japanese that we were going to drop a bomb on Nagasaki , hundreds of thousands fled and lived
War is not ethical or moral .
I do n't think killing is ethical or moral for any reason ever .
We had to fight the war period , it was not our choice , the war forced us to do unethical , immoral acts .
Is it justifiable to act unethically , yes .
Is it justifiable to be immoral , yes .
We did not start the WW II , we were forced to defend ourselves , unfortunately the lesser of two evils is to kill the enemy before the enemy kills your children .
Do you watch a man rape and kill a child or do you do the unethical immoral act of killing the man , justice demands man break the moral codes of society .

doink
There was no debate you dumbfuck .

Holy fuck you are stoopid .
No the STUPID one is you .
NONE of the Generals or Admirals that FOUGHT the Japanese are on your list , now are they ?
The Pacific war against the Japanese was so different from the European war as to make the experiences learned from one pointless in the other .
The reality is a simple one .
The US intended to force an Unconditional Surrender .
The Japanese on paper were beaten but refused to give up and had millions of troops under arms with millions more civilians able to be called on .
The Japanese Government was Fanatical .
Run by the Army they had no intention of surrendering .
We were looking at a main Island landing the first part of 1946 .
This would have cost MILLIONS of lives mostly Japanese .
None of the European Officers had a clue what the Japanese were like .
Holy fuck you keep increasing your stoopidity factor .

Yep , there is Curve 's rational , bright brain .
You moron .
Everyone is laughing at you .
CurveLight , you are clearly emotionally disturbed and cognitively impaired .
The rest of the world is overwhelming in step , and you are out of step .
You are wrong , period .
Good job on sticking to ad homs when you can n't support your claims .
You never showed why all the commanders were wrong and your Iraq Melthod is fuxxing stale .
The Iraq Method is your idiocy , and the event proved the few commanders who opposed it to be wrong .
This discussion proves that your cognition is definitely impaired .
So move along , your case is summarily dismissed .
eots is waiting for you in the conspiracy forums .
Once again you fucking donkey dick sucker @......
you said @:
"@ Curvelight has made the claim we never intended to Invade Japan . @"
So show where I made that claim you lying fuck .
So Curvelight @.....
Since the US was prepared to invade the home Islands , the Japanese were unwilling to surrender and were training their civilians to human wave attack the landing beaches with bamboo spears , and you never claimed the casualty figures were false @.....
You would rather have seen several MILLION dead Japanese and upwards of a million casualties on the allied side , rather then drop 2 bombs that killed FAR less people ?
And you want us to believe that dropping the bombs was unethical ?
You are a coward .
An intellectual coward and an ethical coward .
YOU keep making ignorant claims that are not true and I can link to them through out this thread .
YOU claimed Japan made numerous attempts to surrender before the Bombs were dropped .
AN out right LIE you can not support .
They made one attempt and it was not a surrender but a cessation of Hostilities with Japan relinquishing captured territory after Dec 1941 and the Allies returning Captured Japanese territory .
YOU claimed that Japan made the EXACT same offer to surrender before the bombs were dropped as the one we finally accepted , which was UNCONDITIONAL .
Another bald faced lie .
YOU claimed Japan did not surrender UNCONDITIONALLY , when we all know and have the surrender documents to prove they did EXACTLY that .
YOU claimed that the US fabricated casualty estimates for an invasion of Japan .
Implying further that we had no intention of invading and that Japan was already beaten .
Another lie .
And I disagree .
The question is a simple one .
DO we kill a few hundred thousand in order to save MILLIONS or do we just kill MILLIONS .
That is an ethics question .
You may not LIKE the ethics but it is ethical .
Your saying it does not make it so .
Your question implies you have the right to decide who lives and who dies , you do n't .
The only life you have a right to make that choice about is your own .
Absolutely incorrect .
Decisions of the most horrific choices are caused by tyrannical governments and leaders that force men and women of good will to make such choices .
Please , naivete informs your statement .
Please think very carefully before uttering such statements .
You 're full of shit and I 've proven several times the bombs were not necessary but you keep on wrapping your ignorance up in a form of patriotism indistinguishable from butt monkey crack .
No , it was not unethical .
You have not proven anything .
Once again , you claimed the Japanese made numerous attempts to surrender before the bombs were dropped .
A LIE .
You claimed that Japan made an offer EXACTLY like what was given them after the bombs .
You claimed that Japan was offered a conditional surrender .
Again a LIE .
MEANWHILE , I provided PROOF Japan made ONE attempt to end the war before the bombs were dropped and that was no surrender offer .
I provided proof that even after both bombs were dropped and the Soviets declared war the Japanese Government REFUSED to surrender .
It took the DIRECT intervention of the Emperor and that was nearly foiled by an attempted Coup by the Army .
Try again you coward .
So you can not provide any factual evidence to support your bogus claims ?
We already knew this , keep on lying it is hilarious .

All the men in my family have always been Marines .

Cool logic , just because you never met any so called "@ hard motherf'ers @" in the Army it does not mean they fail to exsist .
But of course coming from a family of Marines I will exscuse your bias opinion .
Well , we could discuss the Army 's judgement .
Both of my brothers are Army zeroes .
That 's almost like being in the real Army , is n't it ?
One has to wonder just WHAT THE HELL the Army was thinking with THAT dynamic duo ; especially , the West Point grad .
Do I suspect a bit of sibling jealousy ?
Well I do suspect that the siblings are a bit jealous of the Gunny being , well , a Gunny .
Yeah , like being a sailor is almost like being a Marine !

Sorry , could n't resist .
On a side note , for those of you who think there are no hardcore Army folks , you need to quit hanging out with the REMFs !
Why did Obama wait so long in getting our people out of Egypt ?
I thought the other day when they were saying "@ no problem @" they were actually evacuating as they spoke .
They had to be .
Now I hear as things are boiling over they are just thinking about taking a ship over there going through the Suez fror a month long trip ?
Did anyone tell Obama it 's dangerous over there ?
Tens of thousands of Americans !
I have family waiting in the Cairo Airport right now .
They report that there are no planes coming in or out , and that there are tens of thousands of people at the airport .
The NY times reports that we are evacuating - so I called them to see where they got the information - and they said the embassy - as you can imagine - getting through to the American Embassy in Cairo is impossible at this time .
My family has been told by State Department ( today ) that there is no evacuation order in place , and that there is nothing we can do but wait .
So I really do n't think this is even happening .
ABC did quite a bit of coverage this morning with Christianne Omanpour .
She does excellent work in the Middel East .
She flew in yesterday , but said no flights out .
The airport seems safe .
The rioters are pretty focused on the police and the President .
Some reports coming out for Americans not to go to the airport but to find their own way via car to other cities or countries if they have the resources .
Feeling very bad for them @..
The Glock dealer was no more a perpetrator than the American Imam .
The Glock dealer would not think to open up a store on the site of a mass murder .
Nobody would defend the decency of his decision to do that , including me .
The American Imam , he does n't have the same decency and respect .
Cool .
Using that logic , if some Christian goes postal in some small town in America , we 'll demolish the church @....
Impossible .
Christianity has never been responsible for any atrocities throughout the history of mankind .

I 'm betting if Christian were responsible for atrocities you 'd love them more .

than why the outrage over the Mosque at Ground Zero ?
Im not outraged over it .
Revere
That aside Your analogy is flawed .
If 20 people were killed by a gun , then you have a point .
To make your analogy similar you would have to have somebody open a place that sells aeroplanes .
IOW , a mosque had nothing to do with it @....
Actually , mosques were used to plot attacks , here and all over the world .
That 's not in dispute .
That sounds like a crime !

It is in reality .

They killed another Christian in Egypt today .
How many think it would be cool for us to fly airplanes into the pyraminds and erect a big Christian Church on the site ?
Raise your hand !
So now you 're comparing one of the eight wonders of the world with the twin towers ?
More worryingly , you are comparing a 3 rd world shithole 's morals / mores / norms with that of the USA .
How does that feel ?
The site of the WTC is hallowed ground , just like where the USS Arizona sunk .
There are remains of Americans brutally killed in both of those places .
It deserves the same reverence , decency , and respect .
So just how far is the standoff from Ground Zero to the point where you want to afford Americans their constitutional rights ?
There are hundreds of mosques in NYC , and several offers of alternate sites .
It 's not an issue of Constitutional rights , it 's an issue of the lack of decency and respect shown by American Imams .
It 's absolutely an issue of constitutional rights .
Revere
He 's not far from wrong .
But he will n't be able to tell you why @...
If you claimed to be respectful and decent , why would you thumb your nose at familes of survivors who asked to to build your mosque elsewhere ?
I felt similar to you at the outset .
Then I realised that you are punishing people through no fault of their own .
So , those good "@ christian @" folk in Mississippi who killed those three civil rights @' boys back in the 60 s should have their local church demolished ?
Where did Timothy McVeigh discuss the Oklahoma bombing with Terry Whatshisname ?
The local Taco Bell ?
And if so , is that to be demolished , too ?
Who are the Christian clerics stepping forward to claim they ordered these atrocities , as Muslim Imams always do ?
Who are the US Imans doing the same ?
No it 's not .
It 's mainly commercial real estate .
And you can n't walk on any ground in New York City @..

You know , when bodies get mixed up at Arlington , the military haters are out in force with all of their "@ respect for the dead @" lip service .
When you ask them for a little decency and respect in a place where human tissue was flying out of destroyed aircraft on the buildings below as far as far as jet parts , they can n't deal with that .
You ready to call for the United States to quit the Middle East ?
So , how much stand off does Ground Zero get ?
And do we limit any new buildings ( short of a monument ) or just the religions that offend us personally .
Does n't affect the fact that I 'm not
I am not sure I understand the context overall @....
but I 'll give it a whirl .
I saw that as a twitter btw , in any event if 20 guys like this guy went out and committed the same crimes , then there is most probably a common causality , here this is n't the case , he appears unbalanced and @....
the end of him is the end of this singular event via his madness that drove him to it .
I think the mosque and what we see as motivating factor behind Khobar towers , the embassies , the Cole , 911 , Hasan are linked , it does n't disappear with just 20 Terrorists .
If a legitimate group of survivors families asks for respect , then a religion of peace should honor that .
If they do n't , then they 're offensive assholes .
They are not asking to clear out all of lower Manhattan of mosques .
i weep at this non @-@ story
Agreed .
What is legitimate ?
What about the families who said they did n't mind or even supported the mosque ?
Some of those survivors were of the Muslim faith .
The context is to simply point out that Palin says one thing , but does another .
For the larger issue , If you are going to take that route , then is Islam an inherently evil / violent religion ?
what thing has she done and what other thing has she done ?
as far as evil ?
no of course not , but its best we be on our guard , theres only one or 2 threads that ties the overarching threat together @...
*@ shrugs @* what are we supposed to do forget the minute after a T act is committed or self bungled or unsuccessful for whatever reason ?
The mosque issue itself ?
I wish they would employ understanding and display sensitivity myself @...
My opinion of it might change if they showed respect to the survivors and families who perished at the WTC .
Barring that , they 're nothing but self @-@ centered ideologues .
So what ?
That does n't negate the majority of survivors who do n't want it there .
The quote in the title is hers .
Opposing the mosque is the thing that she has done .
If "@ crimes begin and end with the criminal who committed them @" , then why hold an entire religion accountable for the actions of 19 people .
Link to poll of survivors .
Thanks @....
What is "@ show respect @" ?
Apparently , reopening a Burlington Coat Factory .
Because that is what this house of worship and community center will replace .
Seriously , does n't this hurt ?
It 's a great argument .
If you do n't agree , refute it .
The cheap shot does n't cut it Maddie .
Okay , let me see if I can explain , Missourian .
For the days since the terrible shooting in Arizona , Revere and I have been arguing .
I have said the violent rhetoric should be foreclosed , and he has said I am undercutting free speech .
He does not at all agree that an atmosphere of such speech may make such tragedies likely to recur .
"@ Only the shooter is responsible @" , he keeps saying .
But in the case of the Park 51 Mosque , he seems to do a complete backflip .
Now ALL American Muslims , all mosques , are somehow responsible for 9 / 11 .
Now , a tenuous connection ( that only exists if you agree with his beliefs about the role of religion in that tragedy , and I do not ) between those who commit a crime and those whose speech MAY support their ideas ( and other premise I 'm not buying ) should be used to foreclose freedom of religion .
Consistency is not exactly Revere 's hallmark here .
He still makes a good point @...
one I 've made myself .
I have as yet to meet a Muslim I did n't like .
And even tho Sunni Man and I often disagree , I like him personally .
But I still oppose the GZ Mosque for the exact reason Revere put forward .
Just like I would oppose a Shinto Shrine built at Pearl Harbor during WWII or a Glock outlet opening next to the Safeway in Tuscon next month .
When Muslim extremist are no longer plotting to kill us , we can revisit the subject .
I 'm having trouble with you analogy .
No one is saying an existing mosque should be demolished .
The debate is whether or not a new mosque should be built at that very location .
So , I am having trouble understanding how you come up with demolishing the church in Mississippi .
Immie
I think in his twisted mind denying the killers the privilege of building a mosque to establish Muslim dominance over Western culture at ground zero is the same as demolishing a mosque that already exists .
I guess .
It 's sick and twisted , but I think that 's it .
Grump is a sad , hateful little bigot .
I 'd like to say he grows on you with time , but except in the sense that a fungus or viral infection grows , it just is n't true .
Yep Muslims through their history have a propensity of building MOSQUES on conquered LANDS @...
Hence the project 's FIRST NAME of '@ Cordoba @' @...
And the scumbags certainly built a Mosque in Cordoba , Spain after their conquest .
You can not apply vicarious liability to one group and not to another , Missourian .
That is why I have said Revere puts himself into a pretzel shape .
In what ?
900 A.D. ?
I guess you are n't aware of the history of christianity in the UK , or in California ?

What group did Loughner belong to ?
Would n't you expect them to build mosques in their own territories ?
They controlled Spain for quite awhile back then .
I 'm sure there were plenty of Christian churches built during and shortly after the various Crusades in what had formally been Muslim territories .
The Muslim Community Center in NYC that has been termed the Ground Zero Mosque is not a monument of Muslim victory but rather a place of worship that American Muslims would like to build and according to our own Constitution they have the right to build it if they own the property .
I still feel that it would be disrespectful to build on ground zero .
He was an American , and evidentially had some interest in politics .
One would expect that ?
THEY had a Victory on US SOIL .
Why do you think the fervant PUSH to build so close to where they murdered so many ?
It 's a statement by them @...
as they have done throughout their history .
NONE .
He was a NUTCASE in his own right .
Bullshit .
To say a lone gunman with no particular political views and no backing is the same as the thousands of zealots , fueled by $$ and rhetoric of their imams are the same is juvenile and dangerous .
Stop defending terrorism , Madeline .
It 's not a good thing .
Even if you do it by pretending it does n't exist .
It does exist , and it 's a fucking crime .
Islam is a controlled and carefully orchestrated terrorist movement .
Arizona lunatic acting on his own is not .
There are no groups of right wingers dancing in the streets waving signs that say "@ Death to Liberals ! @"

If he dies tomorrow , he will n't be considered a martyr ; there will be no mother saying "@ I 'm proud of what my son did ! @"
I can n't believe you can not fathom the difference .
And PS , this is a perfect example of blood tithing @...
you insisting that right wingers are as bloody as the Taliban .
That IS blood libel , you know .
A victory on US Soil is not in the same league as conquering the U.S.
We have had victories in Iraq and Afghanistan but we have not taken over the land .
One might say that Muslims won a victory on 9 / 11 , but in reality all that happened was that America suffered a terrorist attack .
If a victory is won by simply killing people then you can say they won a victory .
My definition of a victory in war is winning the battle and pushing your enemy out of the territory which was fought for .
I do not believe the 9 / 11 terrorists accomplished that task .
Nor have I seen any proof that those who are associated with the so-called Ground Zero Mosque were in anyway associated with the murderers of 9 / 11 .
You say that this is a statement by them .
Maybe that would be the case if they were actually planning on building on the grounds of the World Trade Center .
How far away is far enough ?
10 blocks ?
20 blocks ?
All of Manhattan ?
How about all of New York State ?

It does n't matter .
They brought down the very SYMBOL of Western Capitalist Culture .
The Twin Towers .
They at the time almost caused an economic collapse .

WHY was the initial project name of this mosque called '@ Cordoba Project @' ?
WHY was it changed later ?
I know why !
Pick me !
I know you spoke with passion , Allie , but it is upsetting to read "@ stop supporting terrorists , Madeline @" .
A false allegation , Allie .
Unless you happen to think that freedom of religion = supporting terrorists .
You stepped on my feelings a bit there , girl .
So if a crime begins and ends with the criminal , according to Palin ,
does that mean that in the case of a Jew being murdered in medieval times by someone who had heard the stories of Jews killing children for their blood ( the blood libel of Palin 's speech )
that crime ONLY began and ended with the murderer and his act ?
that crime did n't begin with the stories concocted to demonize Jews ?
that crime did n't begin with vitriolic , inflammatory , inciteful rhetoric spread through that society ?
Really ?
Did she really intend to refute her own argument in the same speech ?????
What are you parsing ?
What POINT are you trying to relay ?
You are MIXING events .
As to the Mosque genius ?
The American people have an aversion to allowing the RELIGION of the KILLERS from that day holding SACRED GROUND .
Or are n't you that fucking bright and showing your lackluster brillience at being a Statist moron ?
There 's a different sort of blood libel .

Be truthful .
Seems to me the proper analogy is how would I feel if someone tore down a Burlington Coat Factory and built a House of Worship ?
Why was n't this land "@ sacred @" before the Muslims wanted to build a new mosque ?
How "@ sacred @" is the land next door , which sports a titty bar ?
Just as I thought @...
You 're avoiding the question .
I 'll ask again , just to watch the next dance you do to avoid it .

The analogy is appropriate .
That is the worst analogy ever .
dude , tell me about it ,
"@ How dare she barge into a story to defend herself against charges of inspiring murder ? @"

yet that same glock dealer will go to an NRA gun show and sell bumper stickers that say ;
make America a better place , KILL a liberal · and "@ HUNTING PERMIT for LIBERALS @" · and stickers that show a donkey with a target on its @' back

You seriously think the left does n't have equally distasteful bumper stickers ?
yup · I did a very thorough search on line for ;
liberal and democratic bumper stickers
and
conservative / republican bumper stickers
I found MANY SITES for both .
from the liberals I found things like ;

from the conservative sites I found ;
nuke liberals · nuke france · nuke NY · club liberals , not ( sandwhiches , seals ) · make America a better place , kill a liberal · I accelerate for liberals · liberal HUNTING PERMITS · targets with pictures of liberals ( obama , hilliary ) on them
Transparent agenda @...
you 're doin @' it right .
Palin said , specifically that journalists and pundits were
"@ manufacturing a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence they purport to condemn . @"
She is thus stating , unequivocally , her opinion that journalists / pundits CAN in fact incite violence with their words .
But she also says @:
Acts of monstrous criminality stand on their own .
They begin and end with the criminals who commit them , not collectively with all the citizens of a state , not with those who listen to talk radio , not with maps of swing districts used by both sides of the aisle
thus contradicting what she said above that .
In short , she does n't have a clue what she 's talking about .
I am not defending her .
I have not read what she said beyond this site nor do I care what she said .
However , the way I see it is that by blaming the pundits i.e. "@ hate speech @" , rather than Jared Lee Loughner , we are taking away the focus on what it should be and that is that Mr. Loughner committed murder and quite frankly I believe he was mentally disturbed .
If any blame should be placed on anyone 's shoulders besides Jared Lee Loughner 's it should be placed on the shoulders of the people and places that refused to help a man who needed help mentally .
I do not believe that anyone can successfully argue that this man was not mentally disturbed .
Blaming politicians , pundits and internet speech is not the answer here .
The focus should not be upon us being more civil to each other ( although it would be nice if we were ) but rather on what caused Jared Lee Loughner to snap last Saturday .
I must say convincing me that our incivility to each other played any kind of a part in this will take a miracle .
Immie
I have n't really seen anyone make that either / or distinction .
I 've yet to hear anyone exonerate Loughner of his crimes on the grounds that the media , not he , was solely to blame .
Yup @...
why do n't you do it for yourself ?

not a thing .
however ; seen in the light of the fav .

Hell , the Catholic Church converted Central America and Mexico at the point of a sword .
Is n't that what I said ?

that seem right to you , in the land of the free ?
The mosque is n't on the sacred site of a mass murder .
It 's located at the formerly sacred Burlington House of Coats
As well as being as close to ground zero as they could get , correct .
The mosque is located at the hallowed ground that used be known as The Burlington Coat Factory , just a few doors down from the sacred Pussycat Lounge
I 've worshiped at both locations .
I think your confused the Pussycat Lounge had woman dancing .
I guess the families of the Muslim victims who wanted the mosque to be built are n't legitimate .
In wingnuts mind , they probably helped plan the attack that killed their loved one .
Of course they helped , do you believe that the Moslems who started this war were alone .
I was unaware the families of the Hijackers came together to build a Mosque .
Hey , if you can n't think laterally , or want to be the messageboard pedant , then have at it .
Go troll some other thread fool @.....
What great victory did the muslims achieve at the sacred Burlington Coat Factory ?
I ask because I 'm concerned that they may have taken over the Pussycat Lounge , two door down .
I worship there regularly
Is that the depth of your argument ?
Do you know why the Imam chose the building ?
You are aware that it 's being hit on 9 / 11 was a factor in his decission right ?
You do know the signifficance of it originnally being the "@ cordova project @" right ?
Are you aware of Muslim tradition in building Mosques at the site of great victories for Allah ?
Do you have any idea what that will mean to our enemies , what they could do with it , and why we closed and deported shinto priests who had a shrine near one of the sites attacked in 1942 ?
Links please .
BTW , just as a side note .
If I was to click on your name and check out what forums you post in , they would n't be Conspiracy Theory ones would they ?
If so , I 'll bow out now @...
If the history of the Shinto shrines in HI from the Shinto shrines will do , including the lawsuit they filed and won to get the property back after the war @...
By 1941 , annual festivals were being celebrated for all three shrines ; Kotohira Jinsha , Shirasaki Hachimangu and Otaki Jinja , with an ever @-@ growing membership of over 1,200 families .
However , the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 , 1941 threw the whole nation into turmoil .
In the worst abuse of government authority in the history of the U.S. , more than 120,000 Japanese Americans were interned in relocation camps .
Issei leaders of the community in Hawaii were immediately rounded up and sent to internment camps on Sand Island , Honouliuli , Maui , Kaui , Lanai , Molokai , the Big Island and the Mainland .
All religious and cultural activities were terminated as the war continued .
In 1943 , the interned Rev. Isobe was deported to Japan , forcing officers to call a special meeting on July 21 , 1945 to decide the fate of the shrine .
Kotohira Jinsha officially announced the temporary closure of the shrine and its activities on April 6 , 1946 .
After the war , members enthusiastically restored shrine activities on December 31 , 1947 , despite the absence of a priest .
However , the shrine faced another crisis on June 8 , 1948 , when its property was seized by the Federal Government .
An emergency meeting was called and a special committee formed to initiate measures for the return of the shrine and its property .
On March 4 , 1949 , an announcement for the sale of the Kotohira Jinsha property appeared on local newspapers .
The shrine immediately solicited the services of the law firm , Robertson , Castle & Anthony and filed a suit on April 4 , 1949 against Attorney General Tom C. Clark , the State of Hawaii and the Federal Alien Land Office .
The case was heard in District Court on May 18 , 1950 with a favorable ruling for the shrine .
Kotohira Jinsha was once again able to continue all activities at their property in Kapalama .
Members jubilantly celebrated the Autumn Thanksgiving Festival on Sunday , October 29 , 1950 , nine long years since the last festival in 1941

I thought it was pretty much well known .
This is not unprecedented anyone believing it is , does not know history very well .
No , I 'm after the links that said the Iman wanted to build a mosque at ground zero due to 9 @-@ 11 @..
Your inability to refute the truth is nothing to be ashamed of .
Afterall , it is the truth and all .
And your ability to troll threads in order to garner attention upon yourself is legendary .
But carry on !
For the same reason the local Glock dealer would not open up a store in the same strip mall where 20 people got shot , 6 killed .
It 's the decent and respectful thing to do .
So what does it then say about Palin 's having just accepted an invitation to speak at a GUN SHOW immediately AFTER the AZ shootings ?
That she has NO DECENCY AND RESPECT ?
Was the Gun show at the strip mall where the shootings occurred ?
Was it even in the same city ?
How about State ?
Brilliant question , geauxtohell .
This theory demands that we buy into the theory that the 9 @-@ 11 perps were just nutters and in no way were they motivated by the hatemonging they were exposed to , right ?
That theory makes about as much sense ( read none ) as the theory that this perp killed the politician for no reason other than he was crazy , I suppose .
You 're right @...
he may have had a wedgy
The night before the rampage , authorities say , Mr. Loughner , 22 , dropped off at a drugstore a roll of 35 @-@ millimeter film containing images he had shot of himself posing with a Glock semiautomatic pistol while wearing a red G-string

Attempting to assign a motive to this nutbag is just silly .
To the OP and those that seem to be in agreement with it 's bogus implication @...
willful ignorance and half @-@ baked hyperbolic nonsense is not a compelling argument .
Let me help you out .
He is saying that the right blames crimes committed by Muslims on Islamic rhetoric while claiming that "@ conservative @" rhetoric has no effect on anyone .
I know .
And it 's still bogus for two reasons .
1 ) Nobody says conservative rhetoric has no effect on anyone .
In fact , it 's desired effect is to influence how people vote and it does an ok job in that regard .
2 ) To compare any American political rhetoric , no matter how allegedly '@ violent , @' to the edicts issued by OBL and other Islamic terrorist leaders is about as fucking retarded as it gets .
Take a step out of the trees once in a while and look at the forest .
There is absolutely no evidence that supports OBL or terrorists being connected to the mosque in question .
Use a ladder next time and climb out of the tree instead of falling on your head .
What part of the reality that Muslim terrorists USE their religion to justify their terror , murder and mayhem , do n't you grasp ?
And what part of of the reality that christians use their religion to justify their terror , murder and mayhem do n't you grasp ?
I did n't say there was .
Try reading for comprehension next time .
Can explain how you connect the ground zero mosque and violent crimes committed by Muslim terrorists ?
I do n't believe there is one but you seem feel differently about it .
Okay everyone !
Manifold says this is a non @-@ issue .
Might as well pack it up @..............
The "@ effect @" people are talking about is n't simple political rhetoric designed to sway votes .
It 's whether or not political rhetoric can cause people to do violence .
I actually think Lougher acted the way he did out of some sort of form of psychosis .
I do n't blame Glen Beck , Sarah , Palin , or anyone else for the crazy things that crazy people do .
You obviously missed the point of the OP .
For the record ( and those slow on the uptake ) , I am not comparing American political rhetoric to anything that comes out of OBL 's mouth .
So I agree with your last sentence .
The point is this @: Sarah Palin made a stink about the Mosque that is two blocks away from Ground Zero due to the fact that it was close to ( as we all know ) the site of the twin towers that were destroyed by fanatical muslim terrorists .
The people behind the Mosque had nothing to do with the 9 @-@ 11 attack .
However , they were held accountable for it all the same .
Then , a year or so later , some crazy asshole in Arizona shoots up a bunch of people , to include a 9 year old girl and a congresswoman , and the left wing punditry ( erroneously ) claims Palin is inciting these events with her "@ vitriol @" and shares some blame over the event .
Palin get 's all high and fucking mighty and makes the statement @: "@ Crimes begin and end with the people who commit them @" .
See the hypocrisy ?
OK , thanks for the explanation .
However , I believe I 've found the disconnect and bolded it above .
I do not recall anyone suggesting that those behind the ground zero mosque were to be held accountable for 9 / 11 .
If there were , my guess is it was a tiny tiny fringe minority .
But by all means , provide some links and prove me wrong .
I 'd be much obliged if you can .
There have been plenty of posts in this thread , with links , that argue that the people behind the mosque should be held accountable for 9 / 11 .
Why do n't you ask for something else that has already been posted ?
He designed his mosque @...
oh , yeah , he must be a terrorist .
And hosts a web site extolling his virtues @....
I guess you sort of left that out .
indeed .
Link ?
<a href="http://www.sakeenah.org/celebrate.shtml"> Sakeenah @: Celebrating Goodness </a>
not hard to find seeing as how the links were identified in news stories .
I guess its one of those things you actually have to not want to know to avoid knowing @...
good job on that !
If they are n't being held accountable , then why would anyone give a damn if they build a mosque within a two block radius of Ground Zero ?
Personally , I did n't @' give a crap about the mosque .
But I can understand how some might have found it insensitive .
But I do n't see how finding it insensitive constitutes holding those behind it accountable for 9 / 11 .
They are accountable for their own actions , and when those actions either by design OR by consequence aid or abbet an enemy in war they are accountable for it .
The only question would be whether or not it 's by design or consequence as in the former they could be held criminally responsible for treason and in the latter civily responsable for whatever damages are incurred from their negligence ( which may also be criminal ) .
Unless of course you are of the legal opinion that a person is NOT responsible for unintended malconsequence resulting from their actions ( and in some cases innaction ) , which would be wrong .
How is it insensitive if the mosque has nothing to do with the 9 / 11 terrorists ?
Good one !
I see another wingnut is too scared to defend his own words
Why do wingnuts always run when challenged ?
As far as I can tell it would mean that people who had nothing to do with 9 / 11 were doing a victory dance for something that they had nothing to do with .
Oh , I 'm sorry .
I did n't realize you were being serious .
I did in fact laugh out loud when I read your post .
The answer seems obvious to me , but let me give you an analogy that might help you out @...
How would it be insensitive for me to call a black man a nigger if I had nothing to do with slavery ?
Suss that out and maybe you 'll get it .
Yup .
And I agree that it 's a pretty silly accusation , but believing this and also believing that crime begins and ends with those who commit them is not contradictory or hypocritical , as the OP implies .
Good one !
Last time I went by the area , the mosque was n't calling black people "@ nigger @" .
Please explain how it is insensitive to build a mosque on the former site of the Sacred Burlington Coat Factory
I can n't explain why something that does n't offend me is offensive .
But neither you nor I get to tell other people what they are allowed to find offensive .
Again , the point I 'm trying to make is that being offended by the mosque and also believing crime begins and ends with the criminals who commit them is not contradictory or hypocritical , no matter how much you and geaux want to pretend that it is .
Gee , earlier you said that building the mosque is insensitive and that the reason was obvious and simple .
Now , it 's suddenly impossible for you to explain why it 's insensitive
Keep dancing
Those responsible for 9 / 11 were Muslim
Those who want to build a mosque are Muslim
Some view this as insensitive .
That much seems obvious , you hacktard .
It 's the WHY that I can n't explain .
But you 've clearly demonstrated that you are incapable of objectivity and it 's been duly noted .
Thanks for showing your hand so easily @...
I agree with you , Quantum Windbag , and so do most legal commentators I have read .
There does n't seem to be any novel con law question presented on these facts and it 's a puzzler why the SCOTUS took the cert .
Have you read the 4 th Circuit opinion and the transcript of yesterday 's questioning ?
It seems the Court is looking at whether the 4 th Circuit was correct in disregarding the public v. private nature of the individuals and event and focusing on the type of speech instead .
There 's also a side issue of amicus waivers .
Interesting stuff if you have n't looked at it .
The attorney for the church is the daughter of the nut case pastor .
The public v. private nature is THE argument for the church as the ruling in the Jerry Fallwell v. Hustler case is what they are hanging their entire argument on .
How they can claim the father of the soldier is a public figure is absurd .
That is the entire case .
The father IS NOT a public figure and is a private citizen .
The jury verdict must stand .
Actually what they 're arguing if you read it closely is that Hustler should be expanded to private individuals , or conversely that the definition of public figure should be changed to include anyone who has personal information available publicly - in this case , through the deceased 's obituary .
Why they dropped the sufficient evidence objection and it had to be raised on amicus is beyond me , that 's the key to the entire case .
The WBC people were never suspected to be all that bright though .
ETA @: On the other hand , the Snyders are arguing they were a captive audience at the funeral , when they testified they never even knew the WBC was there during the funeral .
Both sides could have used better attorneys on this , the arguments dance around the real issues and ignore the facts - on both sides .
No , may I have a link ?
I wonder where they are going with this @...
sure sounds like libel and slander is gonna get refined , eh ?
Nah , the WBC got a summary judgment on defamation at he District level and the Snyders never appealed .
They won on Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress and Civil Conspiracy .
So handle them the same way we handle the freaks that harass women going into clinics - establish a mandatory buffer zone around the site and let them spew whatever they want from outside that perimeter .
It worked in the Snyder case .
The WBC assholes were kept a few hundred yards away , they got to wave their little signs and the family never even knew they were there .
I can see mebbe clarifying when someone becomes a "@ public figure @" for purposes of libel and slander law -- but even that is a stretch , as I am not persuaded anything the WBC wrote on its signs or shouted at passers by could be legally regarded as libelous .
Beyond that , I am not convinced the SCOTUS can find anything new to say about the First Amendment on these facts .
"@ Harassment @" is a matter of criminalizing conduct , not speech @.....
I doubt the Synder family could have filed a police report on the WBC for any harassment type crime in connection with their son 's funeral .
How can a reasonable person be "@ put in fear , etc. @" by a protest they were not aware of until the paper reported on it the next day ?
Actually if you read the decision the Snyders were awarded $ 2.9 million ( reduced to $ 2.1 million ) not because of the newspaper coverage , but because Mr. Snyder sought out and watched the WBC 's "@ documentary @" video of the protest on their website .
True story .
The 4 th Circuit used Milkovich as their primary case with Cantwell quoted as the secondary .
But what they actually overturned the District on was sending the question of law as to whether the speech should have First Amendment protection to the jury rather than deciding it from the bench - which is what they did by focusing on type of speech rather than nature of speaker and audience and concluded it was protected .
The only problem may be that they used New York Times in their tort analysis after saying public v. private did n't matter .
The concurrence at the Circuit level also raises the ( valid , IMO ) point of lack of sufficient evidence to prove harm but on an amicus waiver , over which there seems to be some confusion .
That 's an interesting side issue that may be addressed .
Cool stuff .
Here 's the 4 th Circuit decision if you have n't read it .
It 's a pdf but you do n't need PACER access @:
<a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/081026.P.pdf"> http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/081026.P.pdf </a>
Excellent .
The court must take into consideration the technology of the times in their ruling .
I just had a case where a youth committed suicide and the bullies posted more negative crap about this kid on the web site dedicated to a memorial for the youth .
The parents of the youth would go on the web site to see all the kind remarks about their child and then see the negative crap also .
Usually free speech cases like these take a long time to rule on and do not have split decisions .
That 's just crazy talk !
*@ Laughs @*
Thankies for the link !
Of course they are because without the "@ expansion @" they have no argument .
However , they argued yesterday that TV interviews the father gave "@ expanded @" the father to a piblic figure from a private one de facto .
The problem I have here is that the WBC 's site is n't a memorial site for Matthew Snyder , it is their own property to disseminate their point of view .
By the time Mr. Snyder did his google search he knew from media sources WBC had been present , but he chose voluntarily to view it anyway .
IIED is a very narrow and hard to win tort for a reason , you do n't want to open the door to multi million dollar judgments for anyone who says something that hurts a person 's feelings , whether directed at them or not , whether made in their presence or not , whether intent to harm that individual is real or whether it is a promotional piece for their movement and the intent to harm is simply imputed because the offended party went out of his way to find it .
If this were any group other than WBC , would you feel the same way ?
Think about that , because whatever ruling comes down will affect all religious , quasi @-@ political and groups out there as far as whether they can picket , protest , or use any material on their website or in their publications naming groups or individuals or that could be considered offensive to named groups or individuals .
It 's the voluntary and knowing nature of Mr. Snyder 's exposure that bugs me .
I just do n't feel comfortable with expanding IIED that far , WBC assholes or no .
I am surprised the ACLU is not representing the WBC . Doubtless they 'll file an amicus brief .
If the parties @' lawyers have fucked up the law and the facts , this is one more reason why SCOTUS normally would not grant cert .
There has to be a present risk of harm , editec .
Reasonable time , place and manner restrictions on first amendment rights are constitutional , but only if they pass muster on this point .
<a href="http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/771/771.F2d.920.82-1913.82-1865.html"> 771 F . 2 d 920 </a>
And those already existing time place and manner restrictions were utilized at Matthew Snyder 's funeral , with the result that the family never even knew WBC was there .
So why do we need broad new restrictions on speech , or liability expanded for speech , when existing restrictions already work ?
Apparently the restrictions did not work as harm was done .
It was proven in a lower court by a judge .
Granted that was overruled in a higher court , that is how we got here .
I highly doubt the Supreme Court took this case , only to agree with the appeals decision .
A narrow ruling with a ban on political speech focused on a private individual without a political opinion on the speech in question does no harm .
In this case , the soldier was the private individual and could not speak in his own defense .
I think something about private events that have no reasonable expectation of being completely out of the public might be part of it .
I 'm not so sure .
To my knowledge IIED has n't been expanded anywhere to cover knowing and voluntary viewing of offensive material in the media or online , but with all the tort cases out there it 's hard to say for sure .
I 'm uncomfortable with it though , for a lot of reasons .
The example of defacing a memorial site that Gadawg brought up is one thing , that 's essentially vandalism of another person 's property and the parents would be viewing it unawares .
But what about when the "@ victim @" voluntarily seeks out a site knowing in advance the content will be offensive and then claims millions because he was in fact offended ?
There are a couple other problems with this argument .
The first is the sufficiency of the evidence , which was considered so vital on appeal it caused a split in the bench not over whether the evidence was sufficient but whether they could rule it was insufficient on an amicus waiver ( read the 4 th Circuit ruling ) .
The second being that the question of whether the speech was protected , a question of law , was given to the jury - which is only to determine questions of fact .
The judge is to hear arguments and determine all questions of law .
That alone pretty much guarantees this will be remanded for either summary judgment or retrial - under what instructions is what remains to be seen .
The court has both liberal and conservative points to make .
The opinions will be interesting .
The church is going to lose .
Tough case , but privacy and harassment enter the picture too .

Or we may see Snyder v. Phelps II coming soon to a court near you @....
stay tuned .
Well said but I trust the jury verdict .
They are the voice and interpreters of this tort and did their duty .
This is about a family and their grief first and religion , or lack of it as WBC clearly shows , plays no part in it for me .
Calling for people to commit crimes against a group is hate speech .
Basically it 's a kind of incitment to riot and it ought to be illegal .
By statute as you indicated .
Excellent .
Very good thread here sports fans .
The only problem with trusting the jury on this one is that they were given a question of law to determine .
It was left up to them to decide whether the First Amendment applied .
No jury should be deciding questions of law , those are to be decided by the judge prior to giving the case to the jury to determine the questions of fact .
So if the jury was in fact instructed incorrectly , chances are they will not come to the correct conclusion .
The Jury Instruction given on this clearly put the question of First Amendment protection in their laps .
I still think for this reason alone it will be remanded for a new trial with instructions no matter what the outcome , unless WBC wins outright ( probably not ) in which case it will be remanded for summary judgment .
There was n't a jury verdict based on the proper findings from the proper source .
Nor should the jury be interpreting the nature and scope of the tort - again , that is a question of law .
The jury is to be instructed as to the law to be applied to the facts they determine , not the other way around .
Determining the law and instructing the jury in that law is what the judge is for .
Respectfully , I have investigated over 1000 cases for trial in 30 years .
The jury is charged on the law and in this case material fact was the free speech 1 st Amendment protection .
That is a jury decision as to the facts @: · State v. Howell "@ The jury must beleft perfectly free in reaching a conclusion upon the testimony introduced , untrammeled by any intimidation from the judge as to whether a certain fact at issue has been proved or not @" · Concerning the 1 st Amendment Constitutional argument and jury charges by a judge @: · Norris v. Clinkscales "@ A judge violates this provision when he expresses in his charge his own opinion upon the force and effect of the testimony , or any part of it , or intimates his views of the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence , in whole or in part .
Under the Constitution the force and effect , or weight and sufficiency , of testimony and facts must be left exclusively to the jury , uninfluenced by any expression or intimation of opinion on The First Amendment or any other Amendment .
The whole family are lawyers .
Right .
The jury has full power over questions of fact , of evidence and testimony , weight and credibility .
The judge can n't influence them in any way over that .
This is different from questions of law .
For example , the jury does n't decide whether an objection is sustained or overruled .
They do n't decide what evidence is admissible .
They do n't decide what the law says , they are told what it says and they are to determine the facts exactly as you have described and apply those to the law as they are instructed by the judge in order to reach a conclusion .
What types of speech are covered by the First Amendment is not a question of fact for a jury to determine .
It 's settled law that is to be determined by the judge and then the jury instructed as to what speech is and is not protected and under what circumstances .
They then go over all the facts , evidence and testimony and decide whether those facts as they determine them fit the law as they were instructed .
We are on the same page .
I know the rules of evidence .
You fail to understand they were already PAST that when this went totrial .
The jury was charged on the law .
What IS free speech is a judicial decision and that is where they are now , only after appeal .
But the Constitution , where the 1 st Amendment is , does not allow judcial interpretation AT TRIAL on issues of material facts IN evidence .
That is a jury issue .
Did you read Jury Instruction 21 in the 4 th Circuit opinion ?
If not you should .
To paraphrase ( there 's a link in one of my earlier posts on page 2 , I think ) the jury was simply told the level of protection varies on the type of speech , with no instruction on what the levels are or what types do and do not receive protection .
And yet the level of protection for different types of speech is a matter of law , not fact .
So the jury was in fact given a question of law to determine - the judge did not spell out the law but left it up to the jury to decide what is and is not protected speech .
See the problem here ?
shows the statists all around the country .
fucking emotional pussies
I think an SC ruling on where speech becomes harassment might be helpful though .
I dunno .
It 's a very , very hard one .
I do n't want free speech curtailed , but I also loathe the actions of these guys @....
and those that harass women going into abortion clinics .
There are better ways to speak your mind than to scream like banshees at ordinary people going about their private business .
The case before the court would not allow that sort of finding from the facts , because the family never saw , or heard , Phelps and his church .
I would think that harassment has to be immediate before it is actionable .
They heard it after the fact Quantum .
Harm seems to have been established in the lower courts .
I think drawing a bystander into a political speech for your benefit and the other private party 's harm is the key here .
I think you have that backward .
Snyder is the one pinning his whole case on the public / private division , and the news about that funeral was very public .
The family even invited the Patriot Guard , making it even more public .
WBC is getting sued by a grieving parent .
What the fuck law or act ( of Congress or of a state ) is even implicated ?
Freedom of speech has never been understood to restrict the ability of people to sue other people for things like libel and slander .
It can not be properly understood in that way , in fact .
Only the so-called "@ 1 st Amendment '@ absolutists @' @" think in such ridiculous terms .
So if a citizen can sue another citizen over something said or written , then why can n't a citizen sue another citizen for the intentional infliction of emotional injury caused by the outrageous CONDUCT of the party getting sued ?
If the plaintiff succeeds in the lawsuit at the SCOTUS level , there will have been ZERO violation of the First Amendment 's guarantee of freedom of speech .
The fucking scumbags of WBC will merely have had their depraved , disgusting and outrageous behavior properly called into account .
They remain perfectly free to express their idiotic beliefs either way .
Fuck them .
God hates them .
I know .
HE told me so .
How much free speech will anyone have if someone can sue anytime they are offended ?
I like how free speech rights all point to protecting objectionable speech .
Free Speech was meant to protect a political minority from the majority in getting their message heard .
It was not meant to protect pornographers , hate speech against a minority or politically motivated attacks on a small group of private citizens , who are not even part of that discussion .
Some speech is simply unnecessary to the ends of a political debate .
I expect that the ruling will fall on the time tested principle of liberty up to the point it displaces the liberty of another .
So , if I print up a political track that talks about sex in a graphic manner , that is fine , but if I leave politics out , is is n't ?
How exactly is that supposed to work ?
They can n't sue just because they are offended and that was not the basis here .
Harm from deliberately seeking out offensive material .
that is like me going in the store and asking for a Hustler , and then demanding my money back because it contained pornography .
I do n't think that will fly .
The point was , free speech many times IS protecting something that is objectionable for no other reason than that .
I fail to see how political discourse is harmed in its true form by dropping the pretense that objectionable stuff can protect the other .
Slander is action against against an offensive statement that claims to be true .
The statement that God killed Mathew Snyder because he hates fags , and demonstrates that hatred by killing US soldiers who defend fags , is extremely hateful , and demonstratively offensive , but I doubt it meets the legal definition of slander .
The jury had the chance to hit back at a bunch of despicable people for a horrific belief , but those beliefs , and their right to express them , is a fundamental right in this country .
You may not like it , but it also helps you say the exact same type of thing about Phelps and his church .
I have some good friends that ride with the Patriot Guard Riders .
At age 56 , the more I think about it and the madder I get , to hell with the SC rulings .
Baseball bat to the head of a WBC protestor would make me feel better .
I 've shown up to counter protest at a few funerals myself , I understand the feeling .
And if the case were different , if it were about their actual conduct at the funeral and getting in the family 's face , I 'd be on your side completely .
Maybe it 's the lawyer side of me taking over and reminding me to step back and look at this objectively , without regard for the parties involved .
Because that 's how whatever comes out will be applied in the future @....
objectively and without regard for the parties involved .
Yes , they have to decide the case in front of them , but it will be applied as precedent to all kinds of situations .
If the facts were different then it would be so easy to say I want those bastards to pay and feel justified in doing so .
But they 're not , and you have to take the case you get .
My Irish temper is in check , somewhat .
I was there when my brother came back from Nam in 1968 after THREE tours and the community acted like he was n't there , saw the hooray parades for Gulf War I which was great to see but made me even madder because of what my brother went through and now this bunch of clowns .
Keep in mind also that I despise all religious kooks .
I quit riding years ago otherwise I would be there with them .
Heard some true stories but when asked publicly I go to my Sgt. Schultz routine .
Been to two where they showed up , one where they said they were coming but did n't .
I 'm a firm believer in nonviolence myself , but I hear nothing , I see nothing , I know nothing .
You can do that now but a jury will not allow damages unless the case is strong .
As this one is because we have a grieving family and the chyrch actions are outrageous and not the norm of just "@ offending @" someone .
It is nice to think that , but juries have allowed damages to people that fell through the roof breaking into stores .
Where exactly do you think the line between outrageous and offensive is ?
Does it exist only for positions you think are offensive ?
Can I draw it for positions you think are right ?
The further down that slope we go , the harder it is to pull back .
It is a lot easier to not start down it at all .
You are right .
There may be better ways , but these scum bags will n't get the same attention , by using them .
I guess it will be up to the victims to start designing ways to have privacy , without an arena for the scum of the earth @......
That is the whole point of my OP .
People can insulate themselves from speech they find particularly offensive a lot easier than society can step in and define what is , and is not , offensive .
the whole controversy over pornography is a perfect example of this .
When the court ruled that pornography was anything that did not have socially redeeming qualities the result was far from what all the people who set out to protect us from ourselves wanted .
Instead of eliminating an entire industry , we ended up with an era of porn that included a short disclaimer about the social perils of promiscuous sex , and the exact same movie we would have seen before the ruling .
A simple voice over changed it from porn to permitted speech .
Why is it that Americans will bend over backwards to appease the Islam country 's ?
Why is that we must walk around such issues like the 9 / 11 Mosque , and the Florida Qur’an bonfire ?
Is it from fear of an attack from a peaceful religion , It 's a known fact they have killed Americans before without any provocation in the past .
Like some of these attacks from the following link .
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/target/etc/cron.html"> frontline @: target america @: terrorist attacks on americans , 1979 @-@ 1988 </a>
Not sure how we appease Islamic countries .
No one is walking around the mosque issue .
Hell , its been a huge discussion for both sides of the issue .
Theres nothing wrong with that .
Thats the American way .
The Florida Quran burning has been the hot button issue of the last two weeks .
Not walking around that .
To say people fear something because they discuss events is just not correct .
To hate another people because of their religious beliefs is fear .
Im not afraid of anothers religious belief or color or creed or sexual preference .
I love America and fear nothing .
Glad to hear that you do not fall into the media and obama hype of fear .
If the crazy preac hers burns a few Muslim books so what If they get piss so what ?
If they kill so what ?
That was their plan all along .
They do not need a reason to kill .

Supporting obama has made you delusional son
According to the IMAM behind the Mosque they can not move it , Because moving it will lead to anger , hate , and violence around the world .
From so called Tolerant , peaceful Muslims .
LOL
Noted so what else is new ?
"@ To know a person 's religion we need not listen to his profession of faith but must find his brand of intolerance . @"
Eric Hoffer
The idiocy inherent in this OP is that somehow tolerance and respect for all religions is a bad thing .
No one is bending anywhere , this is America , there is religious freedom , is that not clear by now .
The fascist element on the right wants to limit freedom for all religions over 911 , they obviously know none of our history of interfering in other nations .
If you occupy or interfere in a nation 's internal situation you open yourself up to retaliation .
Have any of the idiots who hate Islam ever turned their hatred on doctor killers in this nation , on McVeigh a Catholic who killed many , or Eric Rudolph , another Catholic , who thankfully was less successful ?
The same narrow minded idiocy that fills the heads of these murderers fills the heads of those who can not respect all people .
Hatred and stupidity have no national or religious bounds .
Humankind is still a primitive animal who can kill over ideas that exist only in the mind .
"@ We first kill people with our minds , before we kill them with weapons .
Whatever the conflict , the enemy is always the destroyer .

We 're good , they 're evil .

You do not respect all religions .
I will keep you in miond in the next bash Christainity thread .
Dumb ass .
I do n't see anyone walking around either issue .
Both that Iman , and that preacher have the right in this nation to do what they are proposing to do .
How wise these actions are in this present poisoned atmosphere of hate , both of the Radical Islamists , and the Rightwind Nuts in our nation is a subject of debate .
However , under our Constitution , both have the right to do what they are proposing .
I might note that what I am seeing here is apparently the right wing thinks that the 1 st Amendment can be suspended any time that it offends their prissy little sensibilities .
Just because obama does it do not think that of most Americans .
So , what youre saying is that its no big deal if the preacher burns the books even if they get pissed , right ?
What part of " a protected 1 st Amendment right @" do n't you understand ?
Another anti @-@ Muslim thread from the hate monger who wishes to see them all dead , whether they be man , woman , or child .
Whether they be innocent or guilty of any sort of crime .
To put things into perspective , the Muslims flew some airplanes into a couple buildings and we got angry .
We , on the other hand , in the forms of the British up to 1945 and the US following that have redrawn the map of their region , knocked down and set up govenments , ruled , tried and condemned their citizens , imposed our culture and held up their beliefs as quaint , backward and provincial .
All things considered , if they did to us what we have done to them , there 'd be more mushroom clouds than oil derecks in the Middle East .
Isreal is the right homeland of the Jew .
The arabs were the killing mechine after hitler was removed .
We have done nothing but put things back in its rightful place .
Was n't directing the question to you .
FUCK 'EM and if they want to kill over this kill 'em
Has anyone else ever noticed that whenever a group asks to be accepted and granted the same rights as everyone else , the reactionary right belly aches about "@ Bending over backwards @" to accommodate citizens and their rights ?
Take a look at any of the anti @-@ Gay marriage threads .
Same meme .
Women 's rights ?
Civil rights ?
Why the reactionaries all gripe about "@ bending over backwards @" .
I guess the rights enjoyed by the reactionaries are somehow exclusive to that group and anyone else wanting equal treatment is just an annoyance .
I love the way the left belly aches and whines for equality but when they are in control theirs no such thing .
It 's their way or else .
I have concluded that many republicans have simply gone insane .
I 'm not saying that some Dem 's are n't insane either , but not the same pathological egotistical insanity that now plagues the republican party , and is why they have lost so much credibility .
The irony is that , though they pretend to defend this country , they are infact the ones that would cause it to go down if they had their way , because , every country would hate us , and we would be all alone and have nobody or nothing , if Republican policies were fully and comprehensibly instituted .
This post is a perfect example of moronic Americanism , fueled % 100 by current republican ideology .
I conclude that you are insane .

Richard the Lion Hearted would appreciate your world view .
That view might benefit from a consideration of the Golden Rule .
I 've heard that the Tora ( sp ? )
can be condensed to this one thought @: Do not do to others what you would find hateful to yourself .
May or may not be right on this , but it seems pretty wise .
Would you find it hateful for a foreign power to roll into the USA , re @-@ name all of the states , re @-@ draw the borders according to nothing important to you , select and support a ruler not of your choosing and impose a culture dictating the dress codes , social conduct and education ?
If your answer is "@ Yes @" , you may be on the verge of understanding the past hostility of the Middle East to the West .
The current situation is not the past , but the past is prologue .
That land is Israel 's land but even if they were not there someone would be trying to exterminate them .
Just how is there no such thing as equality ?
Are you being denied equal rights ?
Can you please cite specifically where I 'm wrong and you are right on this issue ?
Or are you just venting and whining because that 's just what you do ?
I am not the one who has cried about being treated unfairly .

That 's not what you said !
Need I remind you ?
It 's their way or else

It is all about an election cycle .
You see the Liberals think they can blame the Republicans for the opposition to the Mosque and the Koran Burning and win political points .
They will say or do ANYTHING at this point cause they know they are in deep trouble .
Bullshit .
On September 17 , 2001 , George W. Bush gave this speech .
Muslim hatred has zero to do with "@ election cycles . @"
He knew , as does President Obama , that it serves no good purpose to enflame an entire population because of the behavior of a few .
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ZoroJdVnA"> YouTube - GWB 's entire "@ Islam is Peace @" speech </a>
Yup that was when Bush decided to lie rather than educate .
Sad moment , a disgrace really .
Perhaps because we are supposed to be the '@ adults @' on the planet .
Maybe because Christianity got this sort of mess out of its system when it was also about 1400 years old .
Perhaps because we are supposed to be the ones who have found a place for religion somewhere below the mystic .
Perhaps because we understand that two wrongs ( or three ) do n't make a single right .
Perhaps it 's simply because , we prefer to hold individuals accountable for their actions and not the group they come from .
So ?
He should know .
Do you think peaceful Muslims are n't aware of what 's going on with the non @-@ peaceful brethren ?
I 'm guessing people who think like you ( and even Pastor Jones ) have never been inside a church where the REAL meaning of Christianity is discussed .
You left out that he 's a "@ Christian . @"
Uh huh @...
Begs the question .
Do we really bend over backwards to appease Islamic countries ?
Hell , lad , we 've invaded two Islamic nations recently .
Is that what you call appeasement ?
I call what we are doing now appeasement .
There is no need to do that .
But when you elected a muslim as president that what you will get .
Was George W. Bush a Muslim ?
Good grief , they do n't come much dumber than you .
Who 's a Christian I have laid no claims to that name .
You are either blind or just plain stupid yes obama is a muslim and you are stupid for tring to spin this when you mention Bush .
So what are you demanding , you illiterate clown ?
It 's idiots like you who give southerners a bad reputation .
I could n't agree more .
Frankly , it 's scary .
I am not demanding anything stop being an illiterate cunt .
Some people are so devoid of knowledge they think they can win hearts and minds of Mohammedans , Anything that threatens that gossamer delusion is an act of anti American hate .
There was a failure With GW Bush directly after 9 / 11 to make the case specifically addressing the ideology that put into actions that ended in the piles of ruble in New York and Washington and a smoking hole in Pennsylvania .
This failure has been passed on daily .
The Acts of 9 / 11 were acts of fundamental Islam believers acting in accordance with the Quran and hadith .
The problem with that facts is those in "@ power @' have no answer to combat Islam .
Since that day · Those in Power have lied continually to protect Islam from the 15000 attacks since 9 / 11 · We have made no effort to promote the treasures of western commerce education and freedoms , we have devalued the dollar and capitalism out of existence . We had shackled our freedoms in an effort to make ourselves safe .
The Christianity has been attacked as Islam is beheld as a jewel with an unblemished history .
Our business are movie to Islamic countries and our allies begin to take US less seriously and our government walks around in clownshoes with a red nose spouting more ridicules lies about the economy , its efforts and Islam .
Soon the Government will have the full bozo suit on and the west will collapse all to protect a lies .
So what would YOU have done , genius ?

Aaron Glantz , OneWorld US · Thu May 18 , 11 @:@ 41 PM ET
The U.S. government has lost track of over 200,000 machine guns that were supposed to be used by the Iraqi police , according to a prominent human rights watchdog calling for tougher international regulations on arms dealings .
The 99 @-@ ton cache of AK47s was to have been secretly flown to Iraq in 2004 from a U.S. base in Bosnia , but there is no proof that the four plane loads of arms ever arrived , said Amnesty International in a report released last week .
According to the report titled "@ Dead on Time , @" private arms brokers working for the Pentagon clandestinely shipped hundreds of thousands of weapons and tens of millions of rounds of ammunition from Bosnia to Iraq between July 2004 and June 2005 .
During those shipments , at least 200,000 Kalashnikovs went missing after passing through the hands of private contractors from a half dozen countries .
&quot;@ The principal U.S. contracting firm had to use a broker in Croatia that was not known to the Croatian government , @&quot; said Amnesty 's arms control expert Bryan Wood .
"@ They then used a freight forwarding agent in Bulgaria .
They contracted a cargo company that had broken the UN embargo on Liberia and also flew an aircraft out that did n't have air operating authorization . @"
Reached by telephone , officials at the Pentagon would not comment for this story .
According to the humanitarian group Oxfam International , there are currently no global standards for governments @' regulation of arms exports and no international requirements for governments to link guns to their location @--@ whether military stockpile , police depot , or civilian home .
This is an especially big problem , says Oxfam , because 12 billion bullets are produced every year @--@ enough to kill everyone in the world twice .
They and other human rights groups have pinned some of their hopes for tougher regulations on a United Nations Summit scheduled to begin June 26 th in New York .
Oxfam lobbyist Greg Puley told OneWorld that the 2006 UN Small Arms Review conference will help usher in a new level of agreement "@ on basic principles @--@ such as you do n't sell weapons to people who will use them to commit human rights abuses or other atrocities . @"
Puley said the European Union @--@ along with a host of African , Asian , and Latin American nations @--@ have already endorsed this position .
The Chinese government 's position is unknown .
The Bush Administration , he said , "@ has n't blocked progress . @"
"@ It 's certainly in their interest , @" Puley added , "@ to stop people from selling arms to people who plan to use them for terrorist acts . @"
There is nothing about making weapons illegal for civilians in this treaty because that is not the point of this one .
This one is just designed to make it easier to track down people 's weapons .
Only after they get enough tools in place to track down all the guns will they start pushing treaties that make guns illegal for civilians .
oh ?
Point to the part of the treaty that makes it easier to track down who owns guns ?
Articles 7 and 8 ( which replicate the decentralized gun registration system that was set up here in 1968 ) .
So you do n't want to enforce US laws then ?
The treaty does n't create anything not already in existence in US law .
Laws concerning the ILLEGAL transfer of weapons hardly make it easier to track down weapons owned legally .
Yes they do .
Since the laws already exist in the US and have since 1968 , your fear of losing your weapon has obviously been realized , right ? .
Your fears have proven correct , have n't they ?
When did you lose your guns ?
Or is 38 years not long enough to get over your paranoia ?
More idiocy from the gun nuts that can n't seem to read simple english .
Do n't be a bigot .
So , when did you lose your guns ?
There is nothing in the treaty that is not already US law .
Yet you have n't lost your guns under US law .
When the treaty to take your guns away comes along then you can complain about treaties wanting to take your guns away .
Until then you are acting paranoid and demanding we ignore US laws .
It seems you did n't bother to read the statement by Bolton oralloy
The United States goes to great lengths to ensure that small arms and light weapons transferred under our jurisdiction are done so with the utmost responsibility .
The transfer of all military articles of U.S. origin are subject to extremely rigorous procedures under the U.S. Arms Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations .
All U.S. exports of defense articles and services , including small arms and light weapons , must be approved by the Department of State .
Assurances must be given by the importing country that arms will be used in a manner consistent with our criteria for arms exports @: they must not contribute to regional instability , arms races , terrorism , proliferation , or violations of human rights .
Arms of U.S. origin can not be retransferred without approval by the United States .
To ensure that arms are delivered to legitimate end @-@ users , our government rigorously monitors arms transfers , investigating suspicious activity and acting quickly to curtail exports to those recipients who do not meet our strict criteria for responsible use .
In the past five years , the United States has conducted thousands of end @-@ use checks , interdicted thousands of illicit arms shipments at U.S. ports of exit , and cut @-@ off exports entirely to five countries due to their failure to properly manage U.S. origin defense articles .
All commercial exporters of arms in the United States must be registered as brokers and submit each transaction for government licensing approval .
Our brokering law is comprehensive , extending over citizens and foreign nationals in the United States , and also U.S. citizens operating abroad .
Believing that it is in our interest to stem the illicit trade in military arms , the United States has avidly promoted and supported such international activities as the Wassenaar Arrangement and the UN Register of Conventional Arms .
Bilaterally , we offer our financial and technical assistance all over the world to mitigate the illicit trade in SA/LW . We have worked with countries to develop national legislation to regulate exports and imports of arms , and to better enforce their laws .
We have provided training , technical assistance , and funds to improve border security and curb arms smuggling in many areas of the world where this problem is rampant .
And in the past year , we have instituted a program to assist countries in conflict @-@ prone regions to secure or destroy excess and illicit stocks of small arms and light weapons .
It seems Bolton ( and the US ) is against "@ illicit @" trade just like the UN treaty is .
That filthy commie , Bolton !
Somebody should shoot him !
Great !
Now these idiots will start to ramble on about how the US gov't .
is kaotaoing to the UN , if not in the UN pocket outright .

That and their firearms @....
As long as you got your Colt , you 'll never be lonely .
Pathetic and alarming , but never lonely .
I 'll say it once again @: We need to have the military conduct airstrikes on these NGOs .
They hate our freedom even more than Osama does .
A single napalm raid on IANSA headquarters could save us a lot of grief in the long run .
It has been pointed out that the proposed treaty deals only with the illegal manufacture and distribution of firearms @--@ in which case , your objections do n't seem to actually refer to the text of the proposed treaty .
As they build stronger and stronger measures to track down "@ illegal weapons @" they 'll move into making treaties that start declaring more weapons illegal .
It has also been pointed out ( in particular , by me ) , that the consent of two thirds of the Senate would be required to secure ratification of such a treaty .
Do you apprehend that this would occur ?
The NRA does not have as strong a hold on the Senate as they do on the House .
However , the requirement for 2 / 3 rds of the votes is comforting .
I 'd guess that the NRA could block most of it .
But my preference would be to not risk such a vote in the first place .
Also , the NRA has a poor track record in standing up for full @-@ auto weapons , so their defense there might not be as solid as for other weapons .
The argument of the fanatics of the gun lobby is , whether overtly made , or inferentially , that they need weapons to protect themselves from the tyranny of the government , and that this was the intent of the second amendment .
Well , the primary motivation of the Framers was based on the premise that with a strong militia there would be no need for a standing army .
They had the notion that a militia could never be tyrannical , and a standing army would probably lead to tyranny .
However , there was a bit of a notion of the militia providing a last ditch defense against tyranny if it came to that .
In 1939 , an appeal was made to the Supreme court by a representative of the Justice Department after an idictment was quashed against two men for transporting a sawed @-@ off shotgun .
In The United States versus Miller , the Court held @:
In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a '@ shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length @' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia , we can not say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument .
Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense .

This case can be read <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&court=us&vol=307&invol=174"> at this Findlaw page . </a>
A good ruling .
I wish they 'd start enforcing it .
The Supreme Court has never comprehensively reviewed the application of the IInd amendment .
What about the above Miller Ruling ?
Further , in The United States versus Miller , the Court suggested that there might be a standard for determining what constitute the arms of the militia , although they did not delve further into what that might be .
I think they did far more than suggest it .
So far , case law with the Supremes holds that states may regulate the militia and their arms , and prohibit armed bodies outside their regulatory code .
Actually , I think it would be up to Congress to decide the arms , although the courts should be able to step in if Congress chose something inappropriate .
Quite apart from the appalling poor performance of militia in the history of the United States , there is no good reason to believe that any state ever has or ever will allow citizens to arm themselves as they choose and associate in armed bodies at their own discretion .
However , hopefully we will someday return to the Constitution and have the states actually set up militia under government control , which people could join if they wished to .
Whatever may please Oralloy has no bearing upon what regulation the states may enact , and whether or not the Supreme Court will permit such regulation .
Well on the Supreme Court thing , my statements are in line with the Constitution , and the Supreme Court has a fairly good track record of eventually returning to the Constitution when they have departed from it , so there may come a day when they will rule that way .
And until then we have the NRA to fight gun legislation in Congress .
It 's a dream , and a sick and dangerous dream at that .
I do n't see what is sick or dangerous about dreaming of having the Constitution followed .
If the Supreme court decided a law was constitutional then how can it be unconstitutional ?
By violating the Constitution .
The Supreme Court does not get to rewrite the Constitution .
If they make an illegitimate ruling in support of an unconstitutional law , the government will have free rein to violate the Constitution until such time as the Supreme Court reverses their ruling , but it does not change the fact that the Constitution is being violated throughout this time .
"@ Separate but equal @" is a good example of this .
The Supreme Court issued bogus rulings that allowed the government to do unconstitutional segregation for many years .
The fact that the Supreme Court allowed it does not change the fact that it was a blatant violation of our Constitution .
So , you do n't support enforcing the laws then oralloy .
You only support enforcing those you do n't disagree with , those laws you do n't think violate the constitution .
The legal rulings do n't matter .
Only your personal opinion does .
A fool 's game that allows you to pretend to want to follow the law at the same time you are more than willing to ignore it .
I 'd hardly characterize "@ support for our Constitution @" as a fool 's game @....
The fool 's game is deciding solely on your own about what is constitutional without reference to the constitutional manner in how constitutionality is decided .
@izzythepush ,
It is quite shocking that u 'd think that America · wanted to inflict the horrors of the French Revolution on the English .
We were innocent of that .

Alright David perhaps I am being a bit too extreme .
Being extreme is OK if u r ACCURATE , in bearing close fidelity · to what actually HAPPENED .
Your accusation against us is purely imaginary , · with no trace of a basis in fact .
It 's all a question of where you 're sitting .
Its NOT ; its a question of being factually ACCURATE in your assertions .
I do n't honestly believe that the ordinary American in 1812 wanted to do such a thing .
I never heard of extraordinary Americans desiring that the French Apocalypse fall on England .
We were at peace since 1783 .
France and England have been enemies since 1066 .
U know that William had good and logical claims on the throne , by heredity .
During the Napoleonic Wars Britain , ( not just England , it was after the Act of Union ) faced one of the biggest threats of invasion ever .
We had witnessed what the revolutionaries had done to their own people .
What would they have done to the old enemy ?
I see ; u had Napoleon in mind .
I get a bit fed up with all the Brit bashing whenever the Revolution is mentioned .
You seem to hold the founding fathers as some sort of group of Saints , which is fine .
AGREED !
You then expect everyone else to blindly accept that .
NO ; thay were good for US , not for u .
We also have to take the part of the black hearted villain with good grace .
George III is vilified as some sort of Geogian Nero , but in terms of monarchs he was n't that bad .
He was a big admirer of George Washington .
He was very interested in modern agriculture , was concerned about the common man and lived a rather modest lifestyle , for a monarch .
Compare him with his son to see a figure more befitting of the title Nero .
Your founding fathers were not wholly altruistic Saints .
America stands for personal freedom & Individualism , not for altruism .
A lot of them did very well out of the Revolution .
GOOD THING !!!
George Washington became the first American millionaire .
I 'm not saying the American Revolution was n't a bad thing .
America is by and large a wonderful country , but it was founded by men with their own vices , not saints .
I also do n't think that I should get down on my knees and thank every American for their wartime contribution .
Will u not be kneeling qua the First World War , or the Second World War ??
Britain and Russia could not have won the war alone , but to hear some Americans talk you 'd think America did it all single handed .
Not only that but we get Hollywood blockbusters telling blatant lies .
Band of Brothers , and more recently the Pacific were two wonderful wartime series which acurately showed the wartime experience and contribution of American troops .
Not to mention the outstanding bravery .
It grieves me that Ike acquiesced so much to Monty .
Bad news .
Ike was too much of a diplomat and not enuf of a soldier .
Other films are not nearly so truthful .
I 'm not talking about films like Inglorious Basturds , which everyone knows is a load of nonsense , but films like U-571 which portrays itself as being historically accurate , but is a complete lie .
1 ) U boat crew are presented as evil murdering Nazis , whereas most of them were quite decent .
I do n't think any U boat crew were prosecuted for war crimes .
2 ) An American ship captures the enigma machine .
The Enigma machine was captured by HMS Bulldog before America entered the war .
Not only that the enigma codebreaking operation was an almost entirely British affair , run from Bletchley Park .
Most analysts say it shortened the war by about 2 years , but we do n't go on about that .
( I know I did go on about it then but it 's just once ) .
Having said that , I 'm sorry if I 've offended you and Setanta .
I do think America is a wonderful country with lots of lovely people .
Nuff said .
@Thomas ,
And not to forget the Scottish @-@ Irish colonists .
Leaving out Spanish and French colonists in what is now the USA seems to be quite common @...
@izzythepush ,
Alright , Chesapeake Bay incident happened during the Napoleonic wars .
America was n't really neutral , it was a major ally of the enemy .
Things happen in wartime .
Pressganging was something else that happened during war .
It ended in 1814 .
That 's a good thing !
U better not try it NOW .

@izzythepush ,
Our troops were fighting Napoleon in Spain and Portugal .
Maybe our interpretation of history does not reflect the American view .
Then again you all seem to be more concerned with patting yourselves on the back than anything else .
Izzie gets the A2k award for projection for this one !!
America is not under threat of invasion from Iran .
That does not mean that the US Navy would not stop a North Korean cargo ship en route to Iran .
Is that hubris as well ?
America in 1812 was not a threat to the British Empire , while nuclear armed North Korea is today a threat to both the USA and the UK .
@Thomas ,
The religious @-@ persecution story is overhyped by pious schoolbook editors .
This can n't be emphasized too much .
It 's also a part of the "@ New England @-@ centric @" American mythic history .
@izzythepush ,
What the hell qualifies as a "@ major ally @" for you ?
There were no American ships supporting the Franco @-@ Spanish fleets , there were no American troops fighting with Napoleon , American merchants were n't shipping war materials to France .
Your paranoia is truly amazing @--@ and completely unjustified .
I 'm frankly not surprised you feel the need to insult me .
The nation state is humanities most effective form of societal organization .
It is what has allowed the West to become so powerful , and so prosperous .
As a citizen you have signed an implicit contract with the nation state .
You are , in effect , its partner , and a partner with every other citizen .
Your safety , you livelihood , and your freedom to act are all dependent upon the stability and success of the state in which you reside .
If your state happens to be successful , that is , if it happens to grant you a safe living environment , support against life 's ills , and the right to express yourself , then of course you should feel a connection to it .
You should desire that it remains powerful enough to continue providing these luxuries which do not exist elsewhere , you should desire that it becomes even better , and you should take pride in it .
Pride , patriotism , nationalism , whatever you want to call it , is what built the British state .
Like it or not .
If nobody cared about what happened to Britain , then Britain would n't exist .
You 're kidding , right ?
Where did I insult you ?
And you think I "@ signed an implicit contract @" what the hell are you smoking ?
So , whilst swimming in the womb , some god of Britain floated down to join me , handed me a pen and paper and said "@ you can be born here , but only if you agree to our rules @" ?
I did not CHOOSE to be born in this country .
I owe this country NOTHING .
Frankly , I find your attitude sickening .
Pride , patriotism and nationalism are holding the species back .
Only when they are defeated ( and they will be ) can we truly fulfil our potential .
You claim the Argentinian army is useless , provide no evidence to back up your claim , and that attack me for not being knowledgeable .
Ok @...
Ok , @...
let 's put it into context .
In 1981 , Argentina was ruled by the military from what I remember .
They sent their best forces and got annihilated .
Today , an overestimated Argentinian military expenditure is about 5 billion dollars .
An underestimate of British expenditure is about 60 billion dollars .
So , they really have no chance .
I am not going to waste any more time on the issue on imaginary scenarios of Argentinian Espionage when they do not even have a military budget to defend their own country .
No , we should n't .
But there 's no need to react militarily to the problem , when the Argentinians will n't be able to keep up that activity for long in the first place .
We can send extra forces to the garrison , send an extra frigate down there , schedule some training for another battalion , perhaps even send a high profile member of the Royal Family down there [ hmm @.......
] and gently remind Argentina what they already know @: that they can n't do anything other than shout .
The British people know full well that we can n't afford endless operations , but that our Armed Forces have the strength required to resist any attack .
The rest of the world could n't care less .
Britain is without an aircraft carrier for the first time , and is downsizing significantly its armed forces .
The message Britain sends to the rest of the world when it responds with diplomatic "@ complaints @" to blockades and embassy sackings is one of weakness .
The British , if they are as capable as you say they are , should send ships to end the blockade .
You did n't choose to , your parents , grandparents , on ancestors did when they helped to found / moved to this country .
Since you can not consent until the age of 18 , your parents , being your guardians , are the ones who decided for you to have British citizenship by having a child here .
If you wish to renounce your parents decision , and hence your citizenship , you are free to do so .
I get the sense you will n't , though , because even though you claim this country owes you nothing , we both know that is n't true .
You were raised in a safe , prosperous , liberal environment that most of the world would be lucky to call home .
For you to pretend that such a privilege is worthless is an insult to the majority of humanity who can not call a place like Britain home .
What proportion of that 60 billion dollars do you think is spent on the Falklands ?
sorry i do n't understand your point relating to india and china ?
yes , whilst that is true what im saying is the chances of it happening in the near future are n't high at all .
it is clear the government are in no mood to let these people populate the BIOT and with Diego Garcia being one of the most important military instilations at the americans disposal , especially now that iran has began to tick them off the chances of america moving out on the renewal date are next to nill .
for fear of sounding callous , was n't that their choice to move here ?
where despite them complaining about having to put up with the rubbish english climate it is undeniable they have a far better quality of life than either Mauritius or BIOT could offer them .
please you can not possibly compare the two ?
and besides the americans have plenty of air bases in mainland britain why would they want one up in the shetlands
the base does n't just provide the americans with a handy little tick on their tally sheet for military instillations it serves as a vital instilation for forward projection power across the globe , its been used for afghanistan , iraq , libya and countless other missions have taken off from there .
my point is that whilst it is of course very sad the islanders were removed would the benefits to millions [ hear me out here ] that having the base their not out weigh them ?
one could argue that without having bases like this around the globe the americans ability to topple dictators as part of NATO for the good of these countries would have been severely effected .
Fair enough , I could n't think of a decent island , so I just used Shetland as a lame example .
My point about India and China is that together they will be overtaking the US in terms of military spending by 2025 .
And if things go as I feel they will , the global South will start to dominate the North , whilst the US will lose a lot of what it currently has , I have a feeling that the rise of more superpowers and India 's heavy population in Mauritius will mean that it is unlikely that the US will be able to maintain a military base so close to Mauritius .
( Mauritius effectively '@ belongs @' to India , it 's heavily influenced by them would probably be the best way to put it ) .
So the chances in the short-term are yes , very unlikely , but what 's the point in campaigning for anything if they 're not achievable in the long run ?
You talk about dictators etc. You 're telling me that by not using some other base in Europe for example , America could n't have achieved those aims ?
I highly doubt it , there is no need to remove an entire population for self @-@ gain .
While you 're there OP , make sure you campaign for every territory on earth which has been populated by force to be returned to there original inhabitants .
You know being fair and all .
They were forcibly expelled from Diego Garcia so the British could sell off the land to the Americans so they could build a torture centre / military base there .
Of course they have the right to return .

it 's short but if you do n't want to read it basically a guy in the USA has been arrested for agreeing to meet up with and have sex with a "@ 14 year old girl @" who was actually an undercover cop @...
surely this is entrapment ?
he did n't actually do anything because they basically lead him into the situation ?
sure , it would be a crime if he had actually done this with a 14 year old and something had happened when they met up @...
but the american police have basically created this whole scenario and lead him into it , feeding him along ?
He was arrested after agreeing to meet with her Jan. 12 .
this suggests to me that the police officer was the one who suggested everything @...
coaxed him into it @...
we do n't know the full story but i get the impression that this "@ 14 year old girl @" offered him sex on a plate willingly @....
would that be legal in this country ?
i mean i think it 's wrong that this guy would meet up with a 14 year old with the intent to have sex @...
but fabricating the situation @...
you can n't arrest someone for something they have n't done @...
it 's just wrong @...
am i the only one who thinks this is messed up ?
If she suggested it his defence will destroy the case
From previous similar stories , what usually happens is that the undercover officer behind the screen is extremely passive ( as a normal young innocent teenager would probably be ) and then agrees to meet up with the potential paedophile , if he shows up at the place then he is guilty .
I see nothing wrong with this morally , he knows the girl is 14 and still decides to meet her ( having previously stated his intentions through IM ) .
You 've never seen Dateline ?
Please , take a seat @...
if that is the case then i understand and agree , it 's just the way the article is written it sounds as if the police officer is doing a lot of the work , and it 's in america so different laws to here .
They do this and it works , there is even a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Catch_a_Predator"> show </a> about it .
To me its fine , if the suspect has to make a choice , ie leave his home and go to a location , then I do n't really care if he is encouraged .
14 is illegal , same as 10 , both are morally wrong and disgusting .
If he agreed to do it under the illusion it was a real 14 year old , how do we know he has n't already done it before , or would n't in the future , he must have been looking to have stumbled across the 14 yr old police woman .
I think its a good thing
yeah its totally a good thing that police are allowed to trick people to get convictions
He agreed to meet with a 14 year old for sex , and your on his side ?
He should be arrested , if he knew she was 14 ( like some have said , she could have sent older @-@ looking pics and lied about her age ) .
I do n't think the police are wrong for the method they used .
Why wait for 14 year olds to be raped or w.e before arresting people ?
Surely it 's better to be safe than sorry on serious matters like this ?
Paedophile or not , arranging to meet with a 14 year old for sex is ****ing wrong and he knows it , so he should rightly be punished .
Anyone that disagrees needs their head testing , or locking up !
lol ok , this is starting to sound like a dictatorship @..
tricking people into "@ comitting crimes @" and locking away anyone who disagrees .
he is not a paedophile because she is n't pre pubescent @...
I 'm not saying it is n't wrong I 'm saying paedophilia is a strong word and not the right one to use .
Not this debate again
can we not accept that "@ paedophile @" is used as a sort of umbrella term
Anyone else confused as to how a 14 year old became an undercover cop in the first place ?
You utter buffoon / comic genius !
so the end justifies the means ?
I 'm not disagreeing that it is wrong , but i do n't think coaxing someone into doing something they might not otherwise do , which is the impression that the article give , is a good way about catching "@ criminals @" @...
maybe my interpretation of the article is wrong or maybe the author is n't very clear @...
but i do n't think it 's right that you can basically reel someone in to POTENTIALLY comitting a crime ( he did not sleep with a 14 year old ) then arrest them on that basis .
Not sure if someone 's already mentioned this , but a TV programme called "@ To Catch A Predator @" did this - Chris Hansen basically set up stings and then publicly filmed them when he revealed himself to them .
Not sure if they lead to arrests , I think they did
I 'm baffled at how you can be on his side .
He has the intention of sleeping with a minor , which is not only illegal but immoral .
If the police arrest a man with detailed plans for blowing up a building in a city , with all the equipment for making a bomb , but he has n't actually made it yet , would you be on this man 's side too ?
I think not , I think you 'd be glad they intervened and took one potential bomber off the streets , much like they 've took one potential child rapist of the streets here .
There 's a significant difference here - the paedophile caught would have been looking on forums and the like FOR young girls .
It 's not like the girl turned up on his doorstep , stripped and then they arrested him .
The man was ****ing 41 years old
Good
People have their preferences .
Many centuries ago , so-called "@ paedophilia @" would not even have been frowned upon .
You must know morality is relativity , right ?
I mean many centuries ago , if you were known for killing ferocious men in foreign lands , you were praised by your people for valiant behaviour , bravery etc.
But the fact he agreed shows he has it within him to do that .
Just because a '@ 14 year old girl @' offers sex is every man going to accept that , no .
One less paedophile on the streets .
but is a guy who 's willing to have sex with a 14 year old girl therefore definitely a paedophile though ?
in many countries that 'd be completely legal
I think this is more widely allowed and used in the USA than here .
I suppose if they wanted to have a really good case against him , they would have to be extremely passive and let him do most of the work .
Personally I do n't see anything wrong with it - he was gonna do it .
They may have just prevented a child from being raped
I 'm not sure its entrapment really .
Entrapment is where the person has no other choice than to comply .
Eg busting an undercover cop for buying drugs or a civilian for buying drugs under threats of violence .
Why are people defending him ? !
The fact that he even agreed is sooo messed up !
So maybe the punishment is harsh because he did n't really '@ do @' anything , but still , even the thought of chatting to her is wrong !
Stop cutting him slack .
Because it 's been established that this form of attraction , is in fact quite normal in some cases and not necessarily perverted .
- they should have chosen a much younger police officer , Doogie Howsers younger sister perhaps .
We are not necessarily defending this particular individual - just saying it 's possible for there to be a very normal attraction between a man and some young girls - if she reciprocates then it should be between them .
Unfortunately for better or worse some humans have grown so smart they are able to find fault with normal programming and improve on nature .
If instead of age we used cup and frontal cortex size it might be fairer system .
no that 's not true , there does not have to be threats etc. nor does the defendant have to have no other choice @...
well then youve obviously been brought up to hate the monarchy and you need to re @-@ assess your views .
indeed , the monarchy is technically theocratic but thats it has evolved over the centuries - it used to be an absolute monarchy and is now just a constitutional one , we can keep our traditions as long as they evolve to meet the needs of the current generation .
an atheist monarch will come along sooner or later it does n't require scrapping of the whole institution .
and we do n't need her but as i said , she is a source of national pride , distinctiveness , a symbol of our heritage and brings in tourism revenue .
and lastly @..
the queen is the best person for the job .
the queen making a visit to the republic was a big deal , there were some protests from hardliner irish republicans , and general apathy from the rest of the population .
but the irish were bowled over when queen came over and paid her respects to irishmen who fought for britain and those who fought for independence from britain , to her bowing in honour of the victims of the first bloody sunday to even ex @-@ IRA members .
most people in england and ireland agreed her laying the wreath and paying her respects was a great moment in anglo @-@ irish relations - a lot of irish people said it drew a line under things .
now imagine if an elected nobody , perhaps even if david cameron took on the role of president as well as prime minister , would anyone cared or even have noticed if cameron went to ireland to lay down a wreath ?
would the irish have considered david cameron coming over to lay a wreath it a big step forward in irish @-@ english reconcilliation ?
NO
the queen is the best abassador this country could ever have .
she is in a symbolic role and no one has more symbolic pull than her given her familys history - traced back from william the conquer .
have i convinced you yet ?
No you have n't convinced me , that is one act which I agree is good , but does not mean that it is the reason why we should keep a monarchy .
I have n't been brought up with any views my family are also divided over the monarchy , I have just looked at the situation from a neutral point of view and come to the view that we do not need a monarchy .
Also I would n't advise it be best to have David Cameron filling both roles , we need two different people for each role .
Yes it is a BIG part of out history and i am proud of our history and the importance of what they did , and i think the monarchy did a goodish job in the previous centuries , but now in the modern world , we do not need them .
Shows how prompt medical checkups / care can keep you going for so long .
well if TSR found out your mother was seriously ill ( not wishing bad health on her ) you would n't expect me to say "@ frankly there are so many people far more ill than her , just because she happens to be the parent of someone on TSR she does n't deserve any more care than any other person @"
hes the husband of our head of state .
try and dissasociate yourself with them as much as possible , youre from manchester so maybe its the plastic paddy syndrome @...
A close member of my family is in fact in hospital over Christmas , but I do n't request the sympathy of the nation , so your comparison does n't work .
To me , Prince Philip just happens to be the husband of some woman I neither know nor esteem , because all she did was @..
be born to a privileged family .
I wish him well just as I would any other stranger 's husband .
As for your Manchester quip , I do n't even know what stereotype you 're working towards , but I can assure you I do not fit it , and it shows the weakness of your argument if you feel you have to make judgmental comments about my region on the country to back yourself up .
so because we do n't NEED them is enough of a reason to scrap a tradition which many people in this country have a great affection for and affinity to ?
There are other reasons too , but the main ones is that we do n't need them , it also is undemocratic and on a personal note , as an aethiest i can not agree with anyone appointed into a postion such as the head of state by god as i do not believe he is real .
He is such a chrachter , i hope he pulls through

Aww babe , you 're only embarrassing yourself
You embarrassed yourself by saying '@ you mad bro @' .
I can imagine you saying it in a posh accent as well .
But i guess you 're only trying to fit in with your other EDL pals .
I understand , but I 'm talking more about the Anjem Choudary types and the types who are ideologically like but are n't publicity whores .
It 's one thing now that they 're just about 5,000 or so , but imagine in 20 years time , when they 've raised kids and made proselytes to their Wahhabist creed , both among the Muslim community and the prisoners / social outcaste non @-@ Muslims who they target ; they could well be 50,000 or more .
This seems to be what the EDL means to target , but the fact that many of them really do n't know much more about Islamic demographics and sects aside from what comes off of bare naked islam.com and they do n't seem to be the most intellectually astute bunch .
As for the other ethnic minorities , I saw some youtube videos of EDL divisions in Eltham protecting their community during the riots over the summer , and from what I understand most of the rioters where black .
Also , the EDL has a Sikh division , Jewish division and they had a nice article on their website about Ahmadi Muslims @: <a href="http://englishdefenceleague.org/tag/ahmadiyya-muslim/"> http://englishdefenceleague.org/tag/ahmadiyya-muslim/ </a>
Ah right , will read that .
Really ?
Why do you reckon they do n't get as much coverage ?
They 've most likely done something wrong which equates to what we see in the media nowadays about muslims ?
Well , on the surface they go about it in a civilised manner , if you google some documentaries on them you 'll be able to see that they did n't start out that way !
Still , they will never hold enough seats in parliament anyways .
Hmmm no not really .
Even with all the anti @- Islam propaganda , the majority of people do see through their so @- called "@ party @" to the fact that they 're a bunch of idiots .
You can see from their supporters that the people who support them are as stupid as they are .
They 're not even "@ anti @- extremism @" they 're just racists .
Tbh I honestly think the whole Islamic terrorist thing will just fade out in the future .
It 's just another scapegoat theme @- we 've had the Jews and Blacks in the past , now Islam , in the next 5 years everyone might be hating on scientologists or something .
But what I think is really important is that people do n't rise to the taunts , and do n't lower themselves to the other persons level .
The only way to fight racism is to be a good example and change people 's perceptions
I agree with you .
Appriciate your feedback and yeah i hope so too !
Cheers !
No I did n't
And the majority of EDL members probably don;t use internet Memes , as it implies a certain level of nerdieness
This genuinely makes me sad .
Racism is a belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human races determine cultural or individual achievement , usually involving the idea that one 's own race is superior and has the right to rule others .
This is evident in all groups , cultures and races throughout the globe .
To state that racism is in white peoples blood is to effectively ignore the atrocities committed by virtually every other race in the world .
What about Rwanda and the Hutu and the Tutsi ?
Stalin and the purges ?
Pol Pot , Saddam Hussein and Idi Amin ?
Just because a crime , based on discrimination , is committed against someone who may have a similar skin tone does that make it less despicable ?
Discrimination is essentially an evolutionary throwback , and everyone will be guilty of it to some extent in their lives .
India and the Caste system , class discrimination in the UK and inter @-@ group discrimination are but a few examples .
Instead of focusing on the perceived differences between races try and find the root of your anger .
By stating that '@ white @' people are inherently different to '@ black @' people you are indeed succumbing to racism , which to all intents and purposes , is hypocritical .
As for the BNP and the EDL these are in my opinion minority groups born out of ignorance and swelled by frustration .
The EDL are indeed violent and their popularity helped by media images of Islamic fundamentalists protesting against soldiers returning from service in Afghanistan and Iraq , which in a country with a strong military history and history of pride in the Armed Forces was bound to inflame a disenchanted , unemployed and in many instances poorly educated youth .
Which , essentially , is what the EDL are .
The BNP are a far more dangerous organisation .
Insidious in their operations and now validated by acknowledgement by the BBC and political system they are a threat to this country and the very values that Britain should be proud of .
For we are indeed the most multi @-@ cultural and forward thinking nation in Europe .
Do n't believe me ?
The Burkha ban in France ?
1970 's UK style racism in Italy and Spain ?
So , regarding these occurrences , do you think EDL will ever make a mark in history ?
Because , even though they 're portrayed by the media in such a negative manner , they still stand firmly .
Now the true members of EDL are shown .
Spoiler @: · Stevee
piss off
Missed an '@ e @' .
And your point is ?
I am more than happy to defend the EDL , you mad bro ?
The BNP are not however , violent today , to the best of my knowledge , and that is what judgement of them as a political party should be based on .
Not their transition from NF to BNP in the early 90 's .
Yes , they have a rather sordid past , but at some point you have to judge on current merits , not decades old acts .
Besides , there is enough to make the BNP a joke now , without trying to resort to alleged links to C-18 and that sort of thing .

Maybe this conversation posted by "@ Libertarian @" in another thread will put things into perspective @:
A conversation with a liberal @...
Something rather strange happened last night .
Firstly , i was in a pub , which is in itself unusual .
Secondly , i found myself in conversation with some rather earnest liberal types .
The conversation turned to politics , which led eventually to a rather silly looking woman ( RSLW ) saying that she hated the BNP .
Voice of reason ( VOR ) @: Really why is that ?
RSLW @: Because they are horrible , fascist skin head brutes .
VOR @: I see , and what is your opinion of muslim fundamentalists ?
Do you hate them too ?
RSLW @: No , why would i hate them ?
VOR @: You do n't think of them as horrible , fascist brutes ?
RSLW @: No , certainly not .
What are you trying to say ?
Are you a racist ?
VOR @: How many foreign people have the BNP murdered in the name of the BNP ?
But i am aware of the 52 people murdered in the name of Islam in London in 2005 , and the 2,973 murdered in the name of Islam in America on 9 / 11 , and over 1,000,000 murdered in the name of Islam in the Sudan .
Historically there has been hundreds of millions murdered in the name of Islam across the world , every year there are hundreds of thousands murdered in the name of Islam .
Are you prepared to admit therefore that Islam is a murderous religion ?
RSLW @: No , Islam is a religion of peace .
VOR @: But the BNP is a violent sect ?
Filled with murderous racists ?
Even though you can not name a single murder carried out in their name ?
RSLW @: Yes , that 's right , Even if they do n't murder people , we all know they would like too .
VOR @: Would you say that the BNP , whatever you think about them .
believe that their country is under threat ?
RSLW @: No , they are a bunch of thugs , looking for an excuse to hate .
VOR @: Would you say that the fundamentalist muslims , who murder your fellow countymen in the name of Islam , were intent on eventually taking control of your country and running it as an Islamic state ?
RSLW @: What !!
Oh my God , you really are a racist are n't you ?
VOR @: But is it not a act that the BNP claim that they are acting in self defence of your country ; and is it not a fact that the fundamentalist muslim claim they want to take over your country ?
RSLW @: Look , you are trying to put words into my mouth , you are obviously a racist who @...
VOR @: Sorry to interrupt you , but i just want to get something straight here .
On one hand we have followers of a religion called Islam , who murder us in the name of that religion and inform us that their ultimate ambition is to conquer us , whilst on the other hand we have a group of people who have murdered no one , and who wish to defend the country , yet you think that the BNP is filled with murderous haters and that Islam is a religion of peace ?
RSLW @: Yes , absolutely .
Only a racist would think otherwise .
VOR @: Have you read George Orwell 's 1984 ?
RSLW @: Off course i have !!
I have a second class degree in English Literature from the University of Leeds !
VOR @: How admirable .
A veritable achievement indeed .
One assumes therefore you are familiar with the daily Two Minute Hate , carried out by Big Brothers state propagandists , aimed at rousing the passionate hatred of the populace against Emmanuel Goldstein ?
RSLW @: Yes !
Absolutely !
Overt propaganda utilised as a means of empowering the state at the expense of the common man in the street !
Margaret Thatcher @....
VOR @: My dear , you must excuse me interrupting again , but do you not think that yourself might be a victim of state propaganda and brainwashing techniques ?
RSLW @: Me ?
Absolutely not !!
I just happen to be a senior advertising account executive ; there is little i do not know about propagandist techniques .
VOR @: Fascinating , but is it not a fact that the British state via the media , relentlessly portrays Islam as a religion of peace and the BNP as a party of violent racists ?
RSLW @: Yes , but @....
VOR @: You say you are not a victim of state propaganda , yet you defend Islam as a religion of peace , even whilst you admit they commit mass murder in the name of their religion and have a stated ambition of taking over your country ; yet you denounce the BNP , who you admit have murdered no one , and act only in the defence of your country , as murderous racist thugs ?
RSLW @: You are deliberately confusing me , and you are deliberately putting words in my mouth again , i @....
VOR @: My dear lady , i fear the confusion resides with you .
Whilst it has been more enlightening talking to you , i regret that i must now go away .
Alternative hostelries within the near vicinity beckon , with an even sense of urgency .
VOR @: Exits stage left .
The earnest liberals continue drinking half pints of fizzy beer and small measures of Cuvee Napa Brut - all of then uniformly appalled that such an ignorant and racist individual had so recently been within their fragrant and enlightened midst .
Wow that VOR person is a idiot !
If you support the EDL or BNP you 're missing a few braincells .
Such people are n't capable of rational thought and only understand violence .
They 're all a bunch of uneducated , delinquent and ignorant bigots who blame the countries problems on foreigners .
I 'd rather have a hard working immigrant who goes to work at 8 am and comes back at 5 pm to his family then a chav scumbag who sits on his arse all day spending OUR money on drugs and alcohol and playing his loud music all night long .
I speak only of the BNP not the EDL .
Your argument seems to be missing a few brain cells as it does not seem to be formed of rational thought , only prejudice .
Maybe you would like to explain why the BNP is not capable of rational thought .
Do you know what the BNP 's policies even are ?
Have you read their manifesto ?
Taylor Gang wrote "@ I 'd rather have a hard working immigrant who goes to work at 8 am and comes back at 5 pm to his family then a chav scumbag who sits on his arse all day spending OUR money "
I see so , rather than get the British chav people back to work and develop British manufacturing so we a . solve our balance of payments / debt problems and and stop making China current account deficits year after year and b . solve social problems by turning the welfare hellholes with drug dealing , knife & drug crime back into productive places where people have jobs ( which they once were before cultural marxism introduced benefits currently at £ 2,000 per month ) , instead of importing labour so the state pays for a Brit to do nothing , and subsidises a foreigner who is low paid .
You do n't want to tackle this problem then , do just want to keep perpetuating it then ?
And is that supposed to be rational ?
I put it to you that you Sir , with your attitude are part of Britain 's decline .
You do n't understand his post .
Do you think incorporating the BNP 's policies will make the '@ chav @' work ?
No .
The '@ chav @' is n't bothered now , and will n't be bothered when theres no immigrants around , just a slight change in scenery .
There IS work around ; just jobs that people are n't prepared to take since claiming benefits is easier than sweeping streets or cleaning dishes .
If they did take up these jobs , they would n't have such a bad reputation .
TaylorGang wrote "@ These chavs are counter @-@ productive .
It would be impossible to regenerate them into civilised citizens again .
The have no work ethic , no morales or values .
Where I live the council funded a local project to regenerate old houses in a certain housing estate in the town , within a month these new houses were literally destroyed by the same people that lived in them .
What civilised human being would do that to their own home ? @....
the British people are responsible for Britian 's decline . "
I agree with your observations and understand why you feel the way you do , however I do n't think that there is such a thing as "@ beyond saving @" .
There is perhaps a lost generation in a section of society , but that is not to say that a future generation can not be saved .
There needs to be a strong right wing effort to save these people .
There needs to be tough love , what some people would call fascism because extreme measures would need to be taken .
For example one thing I proposed to Iain Duncan Smith was Export Processing Zones , i.e. taking away benefits and giving them the option to work assembling goods for Reebok , Nike or Dell , and this would be subsidised by the State for the benefit of reviving Britain ’s manufacturing industry and improving the trade deficits / debt situation .
Or one could just remove benefits and encourage high quality high specification manufacturing ( like Rolls Royce Aircraft engine dept. ) .
There have been too many carrots for doing nothing and no sticks for doing something bad .
As soon as this landscape changes , people will react because human beings will do what they need to do to survive .
But it will take politicians with some gumption to change this , and the current lot have no gumption , and the brainwashed communists do n't want this because for ideological reasons they regard welfare hellholes with drugs and crime as "@ progress @" ( all they can do is say what they are anti and "@ no passar @" but they have no solutions , and they can not even debate sensibly without degerating a dicussion into a circus with sware words , labels and symbols . )
We need a British vision and we need people with conviction to stand by it , not scared politicians pandering to "@ political correctness @" like we have now .
Every country in the world needs immigrants to function .
America was evolved from immigrants and is one of the most superior countries in the world .
My opinion is that the BNP have no place in our society and I will always stick with that opinion no matter what .
I do n't know if you 're trolling or not ?
But , what makes you think muslims try to convert the people around them ?
Lets be honest , the majority of the EDL are pretty closed @-@ minded .
They 're not trying to get rid of all other ethnicities to make this country composed of just britons ; but muslims , because muslims are now portrayed as malicous beings that caused the 9 / 11 .
Before bombings , 9 / 11 , etc. EDL and BNP did not exist or atleast were not active and muslims were not targeted by such parties as such .
Mass media has caused much of the commotion .
However , EDL 's common members lack the intellect to be able to comprehend this .
want evidence ?
check out the EDL 's facebook page and their forums and observe the ignorance some of the members display in response to some situations .
It 's pathetic .
Sorry I meant it 's far from the best way of going about it .
EDL appear to have been started by people who ( rightly ) did n't want to be taken over in their own towns and have them converted to Islam .
Why should they ?
Why should they be second class citizens ?
Violent people siding with them , the media and people on here give them a bad name i suppose .
No one 's being forced to convert to Islam .
That 's against Islam in itself .
Tell me how they are second class citizens ?
Also , here 's something where their leader called "@ every single Muslim @" responsible for 7 / 7 .
Really , even those that died as a result ?
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqtDG-7ZUpQ"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqtDG-7ZUpQ </a>
As I said , it 's the wrong way to go about it but it 'd proof not everybody wants the whole multiculturalism lark .
That 's all .
Hooligans in disguise , but atleast it 's amusing when they hype up marches expecting 3000 people then 200 turn up , so they end up provoking people and then run away on coaches
There was a protest outside the Blackburn KFC who were trialling so called "@ halal @" meat and EDL were protesting outside .
Although the food was n't really halal because it was stunned first this still made me laugh .
A comment on their facebook page reads .
Tonight the turn out at the KFC was pathetic !
All the so-called members of the Blackburn division and we have six stood up there !
We need to sort this out !

Article made me laugh .
Wow , your one to talk .
Mentally ill ?
Im surprised you remember to breath never mind hold a political veiw point ffs . · People like you should be locked up in an asylum fit the safety of others ffs .
I know that you like Britain to hold political prisoners but , well thank God it is the thug / violent UAF not the gentlemen BNP members that are locked up and in the dock from the demo in Liverpool this weekend .
“@ Anti @-@ fascist @” my ***** .
That is rediculous .
I facepalmed after i read that .
Such a waste of time .
The EDL are n't racist , they have Muslim and minority members .
They oppose Islamification of a largely secular country .
Racism is putting down other races ; Islam has nothing to do with that .
We do n't want Mosques everywhere in this country @...

BNP + EDL - Why = BNP ?
the rise of a far right party whose solution to this balkan situation would be reminiscent of 1933 @-@ 1945 again .
Do you think the world will LET that happen ?
The last European massacre I remember was in Bosnia and the world intervened to stop it , where the perpetrators behind it now face international court
Then why did Tommy threaten "@ every single Muslim @" ?
Also , I thought the EDL wants freedom and democracy ?
If they really want freedom and democracy , then they should recognise that as part of democracy , you get freedom of religion and from religion ie @: you do n't have to belong to any religion , but you are also allowed to practise your religion and by practising , it does mean putting religious buildings up
They do love playing divide and rule .
150 years ago , they divided and then enslaved the black population for no reason other than the advancement of the white race , at a direct cost to those of the blacks .
If they were capable of this just 150 years ago , what makes you think they have changed since then ?
LOL black people enslaved themselves in return for goods .
I guess black people were technologically disadvantaged and thus they were exploited because they were weak

I 'm expecting the usual apologetics from the Tories / LibDems , but putting aside political partisanship , can anyone claim that this news is not devastating to economic recovery , remembering that the plant at Sandwich is not a viable enterprise because of being contaminated ?
( You need to be a local to know the levels of contanimation in the area and it 's deleterious impact on the surrounding environment and animal / wild life . )
Excuse me ?
I 've heard nothing of this widespread contamination - care to explain a little more ?
And if it 's so bad it 's hardly surprising that they want to leave is it .
Your argument is rather confusing , it 's a contaminated , non @-@ viable enterprise and you 're shocked they want to leave ?
They have announced that the closure was nothing to do with government policy .
You can claim they are lying if you want ( why they would I have no idea ) .
And just for future reference , calling anyone putting forward an argument against you a "@ government apologist @" basically destroys any argument you make , because the person reading the post ( well , me anyway ) is just thinking how childish and obtuse your being instead of evaluating any good points you may have had .

This is what happens when people price themselves out of the market .
Why should a business be forced to stay in a location where people demand higher wages , when there are people who will work for less elsewhere .
It 's simply how labour markets work .
Yes because that is a very clever statement to make .
The fact is Royal Security are the ones massively at fault and they should have never taken Prince Charles & Camilla down that route .
They were clearly taken that way to provoke students and make them out to look bad .
Well done politicians and media for being successful at portraying all students to be thugs .
I hope all of you who have branded students thugs never ever need a life saving operation because it will be a past student ( graduate ) carrying out the procedure to save your life - but then again why should you deserve help from people you branded as thugs ?
The police are the legalised thugs in all this and they make me absolutely sick .
I hope the Army kettle and beat the hell out of police officers when they are rioting about being laid off and cuts are being made to the police budget .
Lets see how they react when the tables are turned and they are putting in strikes which are far more damaging and cost the taxpayer more .
Whole country and system is a joke .
Can n't wait to get my degree and get out of this **** hole to pay tax where people respect students for trying to learn .
I will n't be paying tax to help those moaning about today 's students .
Save your own pension because I will n't be paying for it and I hope other students do n't pay for it .
What was Camilla doing with her window wound down .
Was she trying to kidnap a protester ?
Think you just about got your point across .
Oh god .
That was when tsr went really weird and had an error message .
Sorry everyone @....
They had someone on the news today pointing out that they had armed guards in there , and had things really kicked off he said AND I QUOTE @: "@ It could have ended in tragedy , if they had been using petrol instead of paint , those armed guards might have been within their rights to shoot them @"
Beyond that , I think students need to go about their means a different way .
When the idiots who do n't represent the protestors start kicking off , protestors should just sit down @...
Or avoid the whole situation altogether by doing something really positive .
Like getting all those who oppose the tuition fee rises to give blood on the same day .
One of the reasons students are supposed to be so great is because they are innovative .
Channel all of that to a modern way of protesting which means that the cause can not be hijacked and I believe that they will be much more successful ( although I completely disagree with them )
Nobody deserves to be have their car attacked
This is so true , attacking a car is just over the top !!
It is disgraceful , but I must admit I could n't suppress a giggle when I saw the photo of them on the cover of the Metro this morning .
So the consensus seems to be that it is okay for a mob to dictate what roads we can and can not go down ?
Interesting but I do n't agree with that .
Wow !
I mean @...
Wow !
Possibly the dumbest assumption on this subject I have seen , and there have been so many .
Believe me , the students do n't need to be made to look bad - their behaviour is doing that already .
My one piece of advice to anyone interested in the discussion on University fees is @...
READ THE FACTS FIRST .
The vast majority of students seem to be getting their information from idiot friends , Facebook postings , Labour party propaganda or just plain making it up .
Here is my top 10 important FACTS you should all be aware of @: · The £ 9000 figure being quoted is the MAXIMUM that a University will be able to charge per year .
Obviously they can charge a lot less if they want / can .
Previously the maximum fee was £ 3290 but then they had lots of government ( i.e. tax payer ) subsidy then .
If Universities charge £ 6000 or more they need to abide by strict access agreements with the '@ Office for Fair Access @' to allow lower income students to attend .
If they do n't stick to the agreements then OFFA can fine them up to £ 500,000 .
For low income students there is the newly set up £ 150 m National Scholarship Programme which will pay for the first year of their course .
If Universities charge £ 6000 or more for a course then any student who would have been eligible for free school meals ( if they were at school ) would have their second year tuition fees paid for by the University .
This can actually mean that for a three year course they only pay for one year !
Maintenance grants for households earning less than £ 25,000 raises from £ 2906 to £ 3250 a year .
Households earning up to £ 42,000 can still get a partial grant .
The reason for the increase to the cap is because the Universities will get less money in subsidies and have to be more independent .
If the fees are n't increased then the Uni 's will have to provide either less courses or lower the quality of courses which is not good for anyone and would make UK qualifications less valuable in the world job market .
Plus , foreign students who pay the FULL fees ( much more than UK students ) will go elsewhere for more valuable qualifications meaning even less money for UK Uni 's .
The students will not have to pay back these student loans until they earn £ 21,000 a year or more ( increased from £ 15,000 previously ) .
Even if the students earn £ 21,000 these are INTEREST FREE loans .
If they earn more then they will have to pay a small amount of interest up to 3 % ( plus inflation ) for incomes of £ 41,000 a year or more .
If they have not cleared the debt 30 years after graduating then the loan is wiped clean .
The Institute for Fiscal Studies says that only about 10 % of graduates will end up paying back more than they borrowed .
The rest will pay back either what they owed ( interest free ) or less because they reach the 30 year cut off .
Suddenly it does n't seem quite so bad .
Agree with everything above , but try telling that to the sh*t for brain idiots who believe everything they come across they are entitled to , and whenever they want it .
They have nothing to do with the fees increasing .
How would you like it if someone hit you for no reason @...@ ?
There was n't a single part of my post that implied they were responsible for the fees increasing .
They did n't get hit , they got a smashed window and paint on their car .
If you 're going to quote me , I 'd appreciate it if you did n't alter what I say to suit you .
Or at least make it more clear where the alterations begin , and where my actual comments end .
In any case , I assume that you would be angry if a group of people surrounded your car and smashed the windows while shouting threats .
I might suggest that you would think it was , "@ just over the top . @"
I was correcting your statement as it was the car that got attacked .
And honestly im not that fussed .
Now be quiet or i 'll kick your car !
lol
I know they did n't get hit .
You said in your post that you would laugh at Camilla if she got hit .
It 's just appeared on the AP wires and the BBC live coverage .
People who spilled over from the "@ protest @" attacked their car as it went down Regent Street .
No harm done to them , apparently .
Looks like the mob is spilling over .

Maybe they 'll act against these stupid Politicians then .
I would much rather the Royal Family in charge than some house of commons bigots anyway .
Harry is a right laugh and would be great as a proper leader for this country , even Prince William .
Leader ?
Countries do n't need leaders , the leaders of a country are the very people who live there .
Leave the masochist ideas for later , please .
Trip to reality for the royals
they 're just people born into priviledge .
not worse than anyone else
im not supporting the students , im just wondering why its any worse than if it were ordinary people ?
royals do not deserve special treatment , they 're just ordinary people
It 's important - a group of protestors overwhelmed the Police Escort .
That sort of thing is not supposed to happen .
As for disliking them - you might not , but they 're still people .
Nobody deserves to be attacked just for being born into the '@ wrong @' kind of family , be it very poor , or very rich .
They got attacked by being born in that kind of family .
I got my loans risen by being born in that kind of family .
We got beaten .
They too .
Simple .
Life is hard I know .
The point is n't that the attack was minor , it was that it could happen at all .
Royal security is supposed to be better .
One day I would get some TSR users and we will beat almost to death all members of the Royal family except the Queen .
Some users who depend on masochism neg me .
It feels good .
hate them both .
Would n't be surprised if the police escort let the students attack them on purpose .
Just for lols at camilla getting floored .
Rich people need to feel fear too .
Like us .
Agree with first poster - Royals should have more power .
Well , Her Majesty should , anyway .
No problem , let 's go backwards .
Let 's destroy everything elderly British people fought for .
They will die soon , who care about what they can think about it ?
Let 's take the monarchy back and cut people 's rights .
I love your idea , milord .
Ergh , they 'll raise the fees again to pay for the damage done to the car
I enjoyed Boris Johnson 's comment about the attack being an insult to democracy , seems a touch ironic when discussing the royals , no ?
Democracy ?
With monarchy ?
wtf ?
Monarchy by itself erases great part of the meaning of democracy .
It 's like trying to make fire in the middle of the ocean in water surface .
I think you 'll find they fought "@ For King and Country @" @...
I have fallen in love with your comment .
Love me .
Leader ?
Are they ?
That 's funny because I think the majority of the current UK population are under the illusion that we are under the leadership of Cameron & Clegg .
Or those 2 seem to think that its only their opinions that matter .
The UK is not a full democracy and we as the people of the UK never vote on all the main issues .
We also hardly ever get listened to on the majority of topics .
They fought for the country ( if it was ruled by a King okay , but that was something out of their reach ) .
The King likes being King for the power and nothing else , otherwise he would be begging to be taken his position as soon as possible .
Why would someone fight for someone who would not fight for you had the King the chance ?
lol .

All the league tables are based on someone with a clipboard going around taking an annual report of everything at that university and also you do n't know what university is better until you 've actually been lectured there or had an experience as a student there .
All the league tables are a load of rubbish .
It entirely depends on how the students uses what he / she has at his / her disposal .
I also find it funny how you 've said you 've visited loads of universities - there are over 100 universities in the UK .
Any normal person with a job would n't be able to visit many so therefore I take it your unemployed .
Hmm , it 's strange anyone goes to the best unis .
No idea why they 're so competitive .
Because people want to be able to say "@ I went to Cambridge / Oxford @" with a smug look on their face as if they are better than anyone else .
No they really are not .
they normally lack any form of social interaction and can not get on in the real world .
I 've employed Cambridge and Oxford graduates and they have n't a ****ing clue in IT to be honest .
I do n't know about other industries but they are extreme nerds that no employer really wants .
An employer wants a normal person with the skills , not a freak of nature nerd who loves books and goes home every night to practice binary and hex .
And seriously , shut up about Sony .
No one cares .
Well why think you know better when clearly I have experience in the sector .
You may know more about another sector and that 's fair enough .

Tell me how your democratic rights is being infringed by having a monarch , go on tell me @...
The fact is the Prime Minister has all the de-facto power , he / she is the person giving the orders during times of crisis , he / she is the person who decides policy .
The Monarchy is an effective system of checks and balances and nothing more , it infringes on no one 's right for democracy .
Oh and before someone jumps up and down and yells but we do n't elect our head of state and so that 's bad and we are n't free , Norway is frequently voted as the most democratic nation on Earth and guess what they have @...
yup a Monarch .
This was a disgraceful act of violence and would have been whether it was against a citizen or anyone else .
What makes it more worrying is that this is the heir to the throne , that used to mean something @....
The very fact that we have to pay them is enough to affect your rights .
And what equality means .
You should look up the meaning of monarchy in the dictionary .
Just that .
I do n't care if people vote a country without knowing about it .
If Norway is the most voted it does not mean that it is the most democratic .
Of course it was an act of violence but it looks like the event of the day .
Many people are attacked ( and killed , and raped ) everyday .
So stop making polemic .

This is the best news of the election for me , as a supporter of a small party , this shows that it can be done .
It 's so nice to see a colour on the map there that is n't red / blue / yellow ( that is n't snp , plaid or NI . )
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/election2010/results/constituency/a69.stm"> This </a> is the vote share , and swing from labour to greens that allowed this to happen .
What does everyone think of this then ?
I 'm sure people who actually support the greens must be delighted , given that I am and I do n't even support their ( economic ) policies .
Did n't think they 'd go down well with a Libertarian
But anyway , I 'm delighted .
Anyone with a brain knows they 're not a single issue party at all and it 's great to see a left wing party make a break through , especially in this election .

If everyone has everything they need , why is there any need for innovation ?
Why would people bother to produce anything on time ?
Why can people not set up private businesses on their property - why are you making this illegal ?
You are denying them their basic rights .
It is exactly "@ aspirations and **** @"@ , and the desire to have what you want and not just what you need , that has led to the invention of nearly everything that has improved our lives .
I was so happy they got a seat - a glimmer of hope in an otherwise depressing election .
Here 's hoping that , should they have another election to fix the hung parliament , they 'll still keep her in !

Britain also gained enormously from other colonies such as the USA and Canada , but it is n't giving aid to those countries .
Reasons @:

The Smith and the Jones children are now all grown up , and whilst the Jones children have inherited a lot of money from their dad the Smith children are still poverty striken .
Do you think that morally the Jones children have any obligation to give back to the Smith 's the ill gotten money they inherited from their father ?
In that case the Italians have a moral obligation to us for benefitting from the Roman expoitation of Britain .

The Roman empire =/= Modern Italy .
Besides there is a difference between something thousands of years ago and something quite recent that is easier to measure .
I do n't believe they are giving this aid for entirely charitable reasons .
To put in bluntly its like a bribe .
India is very poor person but the economy has been growing massively in the past 10 years .
As people have said India buys arms from overseas .
The UK is one of the worlds biggest arms suppliers so they want to increase sales .
Also as India middle class grows they will buy more consumer goods - the UK will want a piece of this pie .
World and Regional politics also play a role .
India is a very important country in that region so its useful for British interests to have close relations especially with our troops in Afghanistan .
In the future China may be a threat to Western interests .
Just like the UK India suffers from terrorism coming from Pakistan .
Close cooperation will benefit both countries .
Some poster said we should give the money to Pakistan @- why ?
- so they can send more people here to blow themselves up ?
So there are a number of reasons why its in the UK 's interests to give this money .

If you 're gonna take credit for the good stuff , do n't forget to take credit for the bad stuff that went on too , you hypocrite .
The resources wouldve been used for india 's gain rather than the UK 's .
What about it ?
You have a distorted view on islam , what can i say ?
Thats my opinion .
OH , I 'll admit there was plenty of bad , but I 'll not have us blamed for the bad that really does n't lay at our door , like people starving .
So yes , if you want to talk about various instances of brutality and overuse of force by British Officers , then I 'll not deny it , but I 'll not accept responsibility for not feeding everyone in a country when the concept of a welfare state was alien even in home territories .
And no , do n't be so naive .
If Britain was n't there , or to be more accurate , if some colonial force wasn;t there , the resources would n't be .
There would be noone producing and refining them , no market for export etc.
No , I have an objective view , yours @' is distorted
In india , salt was discovered even before the british arrived .
You hate muslims and wish to see them all dead , yeah thats kind of objective
Exactly , I mean despite living in the west we have managed to preserve not only our culture but also our values and morals .
It just seems so unjust and extremely hypocritical , I mean Zardari on one hand , is literally making Pakistan an awful place for most to live in , yet he himself and the higher class are occupied indulging in a completely western lifestyle .
I mean in my eyes , all politicians are power hungry .
I mean my parents are pretty supportive of Imran Khan , he sure does seem a lot better than the rest of them , but at the end of the day how much can one man achieve when the rest of the government is corrupt .
Oh and heres the link to part one @...
Tell me what you think !

Sorry my point was n't clear , but I always though that Pakistan was founded to be a Muslim state , is that not correct ?
:s But yes definitely , I think Jinnah led a lifestyle more lavish than most higher class Pakistanis today .
It 's just the side of Pakistan I 've always seen is literally a world away from what I saw , I think I 've always known that the higher class are extremely different to most other Pakistanis but actually seeing it is a whole other feeling .
My mum was born and brought up here like me , and my dad came here at a young age , so both are very different to most of my Pakistani friends @' parents .
I think their outlook is slightly different , yet I think somehow the Pakistani values have been instilled in me .
And of course , no culture is superior to the next , but when Pakistan was created with a certain vision its sad to see it all wither away not too long after , if that makes sense ?
I guess the more I think about it , it 's true .
There has always been a group that has been a lot more in tune with western society than the rest , but does n't that group seem to be continuously expanding ?
Anyways there was a quote that I read recently by Angelina Jolie about Pakistan , I can n't seem to find it at the moment , I 'll post it to you later .
Definitely !
I mean I think to a certain extent it 's perfectly fine , every country in a way is influenced by western media , but it 's just sad to see the country and people lose their values .
yeah unfortunate is n't it .
i think the country is deteriorating fast .
so much corruption aswell .
its no wonder they 're not doing well economically .
Because salt alone stops starvation and is the basis of a flourishing economy @...
You 've gotten more trollish of late .
It 's quite sad .
Continue such wild accusations , and we 'll see how you enjoy warning points , as you are in the habit of reporting anyone who is less than polite to you .
India was a new nation , salt would not have sustained it but it wouldve gone a long way .
Salt was n't the only natural resource .
Do you have proof of this ?
Its not an accusation , you 've been saying it for a while now
I apologise in advance if there is something similar to this thread , but this is a topic that has interested me recently and would just like to hear your views on the matter .
I 'm a British Pakistani , born and brought up in London , however I would say I am very much in touch with my roots and my views lean more towards the traditional and conservative side .
Recently I watched a documentary by Saira Khan '@ Do n't tell my Mother I am in Pakistan @' , made a few years ago , yet a very interesting watch .
I have been on holiday to Pakistan a fair amount of times , and have traveled throughout the country , so I thought I had a pretty accurate idea of the country as a whole and it 's people .
However , after watching the documentary and various other programs and films on Pakistan I am absolutely shocked .
I may be wrong when I say this , but was Pakistan not founded as a Muslim state , yet only 64 years on and I do n't think the country matches the vision it was initially created with .
It seems that the higher class are obsessed with imitating and adopting western culture , in a sense it boosts their superiority complex .
I actually find it shocking , that most families who moved to England in the 60 's like my grandfather have managed to maintain that cultural pride and certain traditions that have been lost among certain groups of people in Pakistan .
Drinking is a common practice with the upper class society and personally I find it quite upsetting , it seems as if Pakistan is moving in the opposite direction @- the rich becoming more obsessed with western culture and the less well off being neglected further .
Also whilst I 'm on this topic , has anyone seen the film '@ Slackistan @' and what were your views ?
Thank for reading my thoughts !
So , you want to protect or retain a culture , which sanctifies the practices of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_killing"> honour killing </a> , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bride_burning"> bride burning </a> , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_throwing"> acid throwing </a> , the abominable practice of <a href="http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/7523/female-genital-mutilation-in-pakistan-and-beyond/"> female genital mutilation </a> , and <a href="http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/8967/prostitution-in-the-land-of-the-pure/"> sexual abuse </a> ?
Not to forget the tradition of <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2011/09/07/bartered-in-marriage-the-bride-exchange-in-rural-pakistan.html"> Barter marriages </a> , young girls forcefully married to much older men , and some in extreme cases married to Quran itself !
One wonders why Pakistan is the <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/06/15/idINIndia-57704120110615"> world 's third most dangerous country for women </a> to live in ?
Yet you 're worried about upper classes choosing to indulge in a bit of harmless fun ?
As a Pakistani , I welcome western influence on our culture - it might help Pakistan to become a more civilized society .
Edit @: I watched that Saira Khan 's documentary you 're referring to a few months ago .
I would like to know what you found so offensive ?
She was sympathetic to the plight of transgender community in Pakistan - is n't that a positive thing ?
Liberalization is moving in the OPPOSITE direction ?
Personally , any nation 's judiciary system that is in anyway influenced by objective morality scriptures and superstition has no place in the 21 st century .
While I can understand your sentiment that is undesirable for tradition to be dismantled , ever since the fall of the wall in 1989 , Liberal democratic values have spread ( End of History , Fukuyama , 1992 ) and that does not preclude ( just yet ) the sovereign states whom are conformed to Islamic teachings as their rule of law .
Western culture gives people individuality and lets them choose whether to follow conservatism or choose their own destiny and the right to enjoy any liberties they desire ( as long as it does n't harm anybody else ) .
I think it is the right direction that Western culture ( unforced ) is spreading , it gives a common ground for different cultures to interact , promotes tolerance and allows people to pick their own way of life .
I do n't see that being a problem .
Sorry , in hindsight I really do think I should have written the post a little better .
I do not think our culture is perfect , there are many traditions that I do believe in at all and am strongly against , yet I do think that the moral values taught through culture and religion should definitely be retained .
Following your point , I think that to an extent in the 21 st century we require a society based on basic morals and values , I feel that these are the foundations .
I agree with you in the sense that western culture does encourage individuality , definitely !
It has helped to shape the country , allowed women to have more rights and freedom .
I mean now in Pakistan , it is common for women to work and I totally support this .
Women should have as much right as any man .
I think the next step forward in Pakistan is adopting the western idea of equality , which is severely lacking there .
It has a lot to do with the government , when the politicians are corrupt , there is little hope for the country .
What Pakistan needs is a strong leader , focused on the well @-@ being of it 's people rather than power and money .
The westernisation of anything muslim can only be a good thing , western economy , culture and society is way advanced and more civilised and humane .
We 're talking about India here , not Ireland .
My knowledge of Ireland and the situation there is not really good enough to debate on the subject .
I know , just pointing out that Britain has been known to use some vicious sectarian @-@ inciting policies .
They sought to maintain confusion and violence in Ireland by pitting various local religious strands against each other , to stop them from uniting against British rule .
Just a side note , do carry on .
At the time , an India that includes present day Pakistan would have been ruled by the Hindu majority Indian National Congress , which Muslims feared would totally ignore their rights and wants , with the added context of widespread sectarian violence , that is why Muslims felt they must have a separate NAtion .
Also , the INC rejected various proposals at federal deals and so forth .
Really , thats just bogus , as threat of secretarian violence had the Apostles of pacifism in Congress surrendering to the great evil of partition , the very thing they wanted to avoid , so are these leaders the type to impose , please @.....
No Hindu majority due to caste divisions , so who is majority ?
Again USA model would have been best option , with stong regional states with regional laws and a weak centre . Majority of people 1947 did not want partition · India has as many Muslim faith people as Pakistan , so what was the point jeez .
Anyway whats done is done , this is just discussion over something that highly unlikely will ever be reversed , unlike Germany , so better if Pakistan and India can get along and workk for the betterment of the common people , like sewers , better roads , hunger , this is what unites people , regardless of what faith , feeding your family @...
Frankly , I 'm all for the balanced '@ westernisation @' if that 's what you want to call it .
I call it freedom , that just so by happened to be promoted by the Western media .
[ QUOTE=Steevee ; 36252359 India did n't exist until Britain created it .

Britain turned India basically back to time of King Asoka empire , where Indian nation was .
The INC forced it 's creation because they would not negotiate any sort of settlement to appease the fears of the Muslims .

Lets see more
The British Government did little in Calcutta to stop the Muslim violence against Hindus that began on August 16 .
After a week of communal conflict some 5,000 people were dead with more than 15,000 injured , and about 100,000 were homeless .
Chief Minister Suhrawardy and the Muslim League cabinet were blamed for declaring Direction Action Day a public holiday and not stopping the violence .
Viceroy Wavell visited Calcutta and then met with Gandhi and Nehru .
Wavell wanted to postpone the Constituent Assembly , but the Home Government insisted the Interim Government be inaugurated on September 2 . The Muslim League urged people to protest by calling that day a Black Day , and hundreds died in the communal violence that broke out in Bombay and Ahmadabad .
Gandhi learned in October that 5,000 people had been killed and 50,000 injured in Noakhali .
The 77 @-@ year @-@ old peacemaker went on a “@ village-a-day pilgrimage , @” walking 116 miles in seven weeks .
Jinnah suggested a compromise that was accepted , and on October 13 the Muslim League agreed to join the Interim Government .
League members took office on October 26 , but Jinnah still held back .
Pethick @-@ Lawrence invited the leaders to meet in London in December .
Jinnah gained some assurances and stayed on to give speeches warning the English that if they did not grant Pakistan , there would be civil war in India .
Muslims refused to attend the Constituent Assembly on December 9 .
democratic or not , when one party has more votes than the other @:
Meanwhile , Lord Wavell 's efforts to set up a short-term coalition / interim government at the centre had also broken down .
mohammed ali jinnah wanted a ratio of five Congress Hindus , five League Muslims , one Sikh , and one scheduled caste representation in the proposed government .
The Congress rejected it .
Proportional representation could easily have happened
<a href="http://www.banglapedia.org/httpdocs/HT/C_0004.HTM"> http://www.banglapedia.org/httpdocs/HT/C_0004.HTM </a>
end of the day what done is done , no going back really , Pakistan and India have to come to better and friendly relationship , and even after some time a sort of European Union type area , wheere the common people of that area can have better welfare .
Good luck to people of Pakistan
Yea I find that really weird @- I 've never fully understood why thats the case for some people
Read through this thread
Hard for me to answer as I 've probably been over doctrinated from Western Ideals .
However I believe that if westernisation means Pakistan become more liberated and open / tolerant to other beliefs / culture / style then I 'm all for it , ( of course , I 'm hoping that this would outweigh the exploitive constraints that comes with Westernisation ) .
Once these dictators get overthrown , who only raise their voices once their precious soldiers get killed ( not when their civilians are dying in the thousands ) , then maybe , Pakistan can return to its vision .
Why are you living here ?
Oh yeah because Pakistan is a poverty stricken , third world , failed state @....
silly me .
Yet , it was n't too long when your own nation was burning people on the stake because they do n't float on water .
Power changes , do n't be foolish enough to think it will n't change again .
Let 's make this nice and easy for you .
All of the castes are @.....
that 's right , Hindu .
So despite caste divisions , they have a vast majority , and are likely to follow a HIndu agenda over a Muslim one .
Stop arguing this non @-@ point .
Oh my gosh , this is like talking to a brick wall .
The Hindus had a huge majority .
Therefore anything which favours the Hindus will have a majority , therefore to the Muslims , a democratic majority means nothing
Let us assume a country is 90 % Nazi and 10 % Jew , would you just wave through any law or legislation based on the fact it 's a democratic majority ?
Now , do n't be silly here , I am not equating Muslims or Hindus to Nazis , merely making an analogy .
dear me , lets be clear a lable of Hindu means Jack , especially when what is in hindu scriptures IS NOT being followed , so what is point of Hindu label ?
well , do n't you know of the caste prejudices that some carry out so how can thye be Hindu majority when the some of the people go with their caste of tribe firstly , dearie
Next pathetic e.g. of Nazi , pathetic
democratic will of people was against great evil of partition and thats a facts , proportional representation was given and thats a fact !
yes deny democracy when representation was there !!
Talking of nazism , and fascim the 2 nation theory is exactly that hence ethnic cleansing campaigns began in Pakistan area , and later spread @:

All these atrocities on Hindus and Sikhs brought no condemnation whatever from the Muslim League leaders .
They either kept silent about them , or continued to trot out imaginary atrocities on Muslims .
This not only encouraged the Muslim goondas , but gave them the confidence that they could go on safely with the blessings of the League leaders .
You seem like those stupid football hooligans .
Why did you mention Pakistan ?
Islam did n't originate in Pakistan , most Muslims are not Pakistani , and the pakistani government is n't even ruling by islamic laws .

And how do you even know that I am not English or partly English ?
Pakistan is being Westernised , and with it will come rational thought , less religious nutcases and greater economic prosperity .

I would answer this if it were not for the ad @-@ hominem attacks and insults .
OH please , the only person bending over backwards for Jinnah was Ghandi .
Of course India did not want the partition , the INC rather , they wanted to rule the whole of India , and regardless of Caste , it would have been a Hindu majority .
By that logic then , Europe should be Rome ?
Various Empires have ruled various landmasses at various times , that does n't make that a nation .
At the time of the BEIC starting it 's gradual rise to power in India , there was no India in the sense of a single nation .
It was a patchwork of independent kingdoms , states and wastelands .

And that 's a bad thing why ?
Westernisation = Progress .
Imitating the most developed countries in the world is n't really a bad thing .
Pakistan was founded on the basis that Muslims felt their interests would not be guarded by a Hindu government , not as some spiritual Muslim homeland .
As it is , I 'd hardly say Pakistan is '@ Western @' , what with it 's blasphemy laws , it 's constant conflict with India , conservative populace , tacit funding and support for various Islamist organisations .
I think rather than worrying about the populace , worry about yourself .
Who are you to judge people if they wish to drink alcohol , or watch Western TV ?
Also , as you bemoan the West .
It 's worth remembering you would n't have had a country without us
WHAT ?
explain yourself @...
Pakistan was created by Britain .
Without us Pakistan would have been another province of India .
Well , that 's difficult to say , without the British in India who knows what would have happened .
But my point is , it was Britain that created , or allowed the creation of , Pakistan .
Yes , the conference held by the US DOD and attended by representatives from Bangladesh and Pakistan where the Bangladeshis put the amount of dead at 300,000 was clearly some kind of elaborate ISI conspiracy .
The Pakistani figure is near 30,000 by the way not 300,000 .
The situation in Balochistan and Waziristan is regrettable and I genuinely feel the pain of those living in these areas but it 's wrought with complications @- not something I expect someone only intent on slandering my country to understand .
You have been completely blown out of the water .
You can now argue yourself if you wish
Except that the article posted Clearly stated various bangladeshi politicians IN Bangladesh stated the death toll to be in the millions .
And they state as many of the independent political commentators and most of the rest of the worlds on @-@ lookers that pakistan attempted genocide in bangladesh - which India was able to eventually thwart .
But of course pakistanis deny all this so it must be innacurate
sorry but credibility is hardly your strong point .
If india had any real amnimoty toward pakistanis or muslims in general , they had the opportunity to completely bomb most of its cities to oblivion soon after defeating paksitans army - as the Allies did to nazii germany at the end of the war .
But they did n't , they chose to forgive and forget - unfortunately extremism in pakistan has never left its conciousness even after these sorts of events .
I too feel sorry for the Balouchis , who had no problems lviing alongside other indians for a thousand years or so and now are oppressed by fanatics under a pakistani flag .
Yep britain whipped up extremism for years then gave them a home by carving out pakistan allowing it to fester .
Probably the only accurate point you have ever made on tsr .
Oh please .
Britain did not '@ whip up extremism @' , Britain recognised different religious groups , and encouraged all religious groups to have their own identity .
A mistake , but not really '@ whipping up extremism @' .
It 's not Britain 's fault that once these religious types realised their own identity they felt the need to start killing people and engaing in sectarian violence .
Yes , that 's right , systematic rape and the cold blooded torture and murder of around 90,000 people is unavoidable .
As is the the killing of perhaps over 10,000 Sikhs by mobs armed to the teeth and supported by the police .
Please concentrate on admitting all this and not trying to justify them .
Yes there 's a cause and effect for everything but unfortunately for you this includes so called Islamic terrorism @- note how these acts are irrevocably linked to the persecution of Muslims / invasions etc.
I have already said the genocide is a massive blot on the face of Pakistan @- regardless "@ millions @" were n't killed , estimates by neutral historians are around 300,000 dead .
The Pakistani and Bangladeshi authorities obviously give wildly biased figures .
Right , the Barbary pirates were enslaving "@ kaffirs @" because the just @-@ founded USA was invading the Middle East and persecuting Muslims .
Idiot .
It always makes me laugh when people suggest there is no pattern between so called Islamic extremism and the oppression of Muslims .
I know a Palestinian man at university whose mother was killed during an Israeli airstrike and whose brother was buried alive when their house was bulldozed @- now tell me how likely is this man to turn to violence than a Muslim living comfortably in the suburbs of Birmingham ?
That 's a rhetorical question in case you did n't realise that either .
Of course there 's a pattern , but it pisses me off when people use some correlative events as exculpatory anecdotes for Islamic uprising .
This is one of the worst posts I 've seen on TSR regarding Israel , and believe me , there 's a lot to choose from .
First of all , Jews did not immigrate to the point where they formed a majority @:
[ <a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/palpop.htm"> http://www.mideastweb.org/palpop.htm </a> - includes sources ]
Secondly , the Jews did not divide Mandated Palestine nor was the idea to establish a Jewish homeland based on guilt from the Holocaust - how can you even say this nonsense ?
The only thing the Holocaust did was underline the need for a Jewish homeland , an idea that that really came to fruition in the late 1800 's when Theodore Herzl lead the First Zionist Congress which then lead to the creation of the the World Zionist Organization .
The pledge to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine came about with the Balfour Deceleration in 1917 which was incorporated into a peace treaty during the San Remo conference in 1920 ( which included Britain , France , Italy , Japan and the US ) - this is at least 2 decades before WW2 started .
Expanding on the above , the idea to partition Palestine originated around 1937 with the Peel Commission which was then followed up by the Woodhead Commission ( later evaluated at the St. James Conference ) - these were British en @-@ devours , not nefarious Jewish plans .
The idea to partition arose due to the understanding that Jewish and Arab interests were irreconcilable - during this , violence was increasing more and more .
The British wanted out of Palestine as soon as possible and as such , they handed power over to the UN in 1947 .
The UN then established UNSCOP to devise a solution and they too came up with a partition plan which took the form of a GA resolution - Israel declared independence according to the partition plan a day before the British Mandate was due to expire and in 1949 they were admitted to the UN so no , the Jews did not exceed their authority , gain a majority through immigration or come up with a nefarious plan to split Palestine .
Here 's a tip for you .
If you do n't want to expose yourself as being an anti @-@ Semitic moron , then try not to say things like "@ I had a feeling you were a Jew @" or "@ @...
Defender of the Jews @" , trying replacing the word "@ Jew @" with "@ Zionist @" , it 's much more covert .
Do n't bother trying to say "@ but but I can n't be antisemitic because Arabs are Semitic and I do n't mind them ! @"
- the term antisemitism was coined by the Jew @-@ hating German Wilhelm Marr in 1987 @~ and as such refers to Jews , not Semitic people .
I guess , according to your "@ logic @" , Palestinians are n't allowed to '@ defend @' themselves because the bastards have a habit of killing innocent Jews spanning from 1920 up until 2011
According to <a href="http://israelipalestinian.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000636#chart1"> http://israelipalestinian.procon.org @...@ </a> <a href="http://israelipalestinian.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000636#chart1"> = 000636 #chart1 </a> , · Jews were in the majority from about 1950 onwards .
As you can see from your charts , they increased as a percentage of the total population steadily before that ( although there was a big jump in 1948 , when some 850 000 jewish people immigrated )
I believe there is little general denial that the western european states looked upon the setting up of a Jewish state a lot more favourably after WW2 .
That does not mean it was a nefarious plan .
However they did mass immigrate , both before it became a state and afterwards .
They then took control .
According to my logic , you should punish the perpetrators , instead of a group of people which includes the perpetrators .
The state is not responsible as a whole for the firing of rockets .
However they are all punished .
The entire point of discrimination is to group a number of people together and act like they are all responsible for what a small percentage of that group has participated in . Examples are people who blame every algerian immigrant they see for theft because algerians have a higher crime rate on average in their country , or all the christian democrats getting murdered in a 1930 s German city because 2 resisted the SS or SA .
However you might turn it , you have a colony in 1890 with 2 % of its population being jewish .
In 1947 that is 33 % ( <a href="http://www.representativepress.org/IsraelHistory.html"> http://www.representativepress.org/IsraelHistory.html </a> ) .
They obtain control , do not listen to what the UN tells them to do and discriminate against the population which used to compromise 98 % of the population 60 years ago .
That is the fundamental fear of western societies who are afraid of immigration .
They have now almost split up into two separate countries , where some inhabitants of one send a few rockets to the other side once a while .
The other side has invaded with soldiers and tanks , decided what is allowed into the country and harasses people from the other side several times a day ( when they cross checkpoints or the border ) .
The division is nowhere near to how the UN decided the country should be divided .
I strongly hope that on one side the new Egyptian government will open the border to allow any non @-@ arms kind of trade ( such as building materials ) and that the Israeli government realizes that laws regarding freedom of speech issues ( such as a ban on speaking in favour of boycotting products from Israeli settlements based in Palestinia ) only create more frustration and are not in its long-term interest .
Because they people they are supposedly being '@ defending @' themselves against are systematically having their rights taken away by Israeli foreign policy who insist they life in a state of complete autonomy with no world recognition or any equality - and for that matter , subjecting Palestinians to torture , regularly bombing schools and hospitals and refusing to allow them the basic tools and materials to rebuild their society and economy .
I completely agree !
As an individual who is of Jewish descent , ( I am also of Arab descent ) I do not agree with the mistreatment of anyone .
Be it from my own people or not .
Look at what he said when he was running for president .
He has said that he wants to "@ fundamentally transform @" the country into something completely different , and I just do n't think that sounds like something someone who loves his people and country would say .
He wants the role of United States diminished among the countries of the world .
As for anti @-@ american policies , there are so many .
Here are some · He wants to take away free choice with regard to healthcare and put government in charge .
America was founded on free markets and capitalism so this is anti @-@ american · He has taken over many american businesses , again going against american free market principles .
He is trying to silence radio talk show hosts like rush limbaugh by implementing a regulatory scheme that would impose government controls on content instead of letting the free markets decide what the content should be .
This is in violation of free speech , another principle this country was founded on .
He is trying to use the FCC to control internet content , because he knows that as long as there is free speech online , people will be critical of him · He has had many loud and very public battles with fox news and rush limbaugh .
He wants a single party press , not the free one that we have now .
He has repeatedly said that now that he is in power , the opposition should just shut up and get out of the way , and that goes against the first amendment .
He wants to take away our second amendment , the right to bear arms , which is an american civil liberty going back to the time the country was founded .
He believes in higher taxes and with more money taxed from people , they have less economic civil liberty .
More powerful government means less power for the people .
I believe that raising taxes is anti @-@ american .
You are twisting various things he has done , also democrats would have done at least 70 % of the same thing .
Just because your political allegiance is to GOP and not him , does n't mean that he is anti @-@ American @...
just means that he is a Democrat no ?
But no , I do n't believe he is Anti @-@ American at allll
Come on , you know thats rubbish @..
Also do n't make me laugh , American Free Market ? @...
Why did you give so much money to Wall Street then ? @..
if you were really free market , you 'd have let them all crash and burn @..
btw this was n't just Obama but also Bush ! @..
so Bush is Anti @-@ American now right ?
Bush was wrong to try to bail everything out too .
I was not a fan of Bush , he was a left wing progressive who was almost as bad as Obama
Mitt Romney is in my opinion , the American version of David Cameron .
In other words - a conservative in name only .
I have been very disappointed with Cameron , and greatly wish that there was a real Conservative in charge of the Conservative Party and the country .
Some would argue that Romney is the only candidate who can beat Obama , since he is a moderate who can appeal to swing voters .
The same sort of thing was said about Cameron - that the Tories needed someone like him to detoxify the brand and appeal to all of society .
In both cases this is , in my opinion , nonsense .
Ronald Reagan ran from an ideologically truly conservative platform .
He won against Carter ( who was very similar to Obama ) and got re @-@ elected with one of the biggest landslides ever .
Also , in Britain , Margaret Thatcher who ran from ideologically truly conservative platform , was re @-@ elected with a landslide not once but twice .
What did wishy washy liberal "@ conservative @" Cameron achieve ?
A hung parliament when the election was an open goal .
If Romney gets the nomination , he will lose .
America needs a Reagan , and Britain needs a Thatcher .
The problem with that thinking is that you ignore 30 years of political development .
Thatcher and Reagan both beat ideological left wingers in Callahan and Carter .
Whatever you think about Obama , he is quite centralist with a lot of his failings coming from the fact he has tried to work across the aisle even when he had a supermajority .
Since 1992 both the UK and the US and seen the left triangulate the right through '@ third way @' to capture the centre ground leading to the electoral success of Clinton and New Labour .
A right wing ideologue will n't win now as they need to win the centre who generally prefer more moderate candidates .
You change your tune quickly .
I remember not long ago you were defending Bush as the best thing since Reagan @...
Why would you ask the Irish ?
The only people that should be asked is the northern Irish , do they want to be apart of the UK or Ireland .
If you are going to ask the whole of Ireland then you should be asking the rest of the UK too
For Northern Ireland to be rejoined to the Republic there has to be a referendum in the Republic aswell , it 's always been part of the peace process .
It 's a secondary referendum though , only held if Northern Ireland votes for unity .
It 's also not 100 % guaranteed that the Republic would vote in favour of reunification given all the trouble it could cause ; economically I do n't think it 'd be too tough , it 's not East Germany we 're talking about here but politically it 'd be a nightmare .
I think the city name in my location gives it away , or do you not know where "@ Belfast @" is ?
Of course I 'm a new SF supporter , I 'm not even 25 .
I can n't comment on whether I 'd 've voted for them during the Troubles as I was only born near the end .
Least I can remember it .
Personally , given me uncle marches in the Orange Order and I 've lost family members to the '@ RA , it 's bad enough , to my family , that I support them now .
I 've always wanted a United Ireland , though , all my life .
That 's interesting , so you are a protestant background , Scots @-@ Irish SF supporter ?
Nah , it 'll be the Kingdom of Great Britain if NI left .
Great Britain has never been the UK .
Yeah I know it was just the Kingdom of Great Britain before Ireland joined , but I doubt they 'd change the name back to that if Northern Ireland left .
It would be easier to keep it as the UK .
The name would still make sense considering it 's still the union of the former kingdoms of England and Scotland .
Calling it the UK would probably fall out of use eventually , but that would happen gradually .
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBT4ZWy6Lm4"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBT4ZWy6Lm4 </a>
Why do you keep talking like you 're some 50 year old , experienced IRA man , who endured all this hardship and oppression ?
You 're a teenager behind a computer screen ffs .
I do n't think I talk like that tbh . I have learned a lot off many people with first hand experience .
Do n't give me that "@ behind a computer @" crap if you do n't know me in real life .
Let me guess , you 're 17 / 18 years old who happens to know a few older men who were involved with the provos / INLA and are feeding you a romanticised , one sided version of events .
You 've become overawed by all this bull**** romanticism and propaganda instead of using your brain , the sort of chap who sings "@ Go on home British soliders @" when are no British soldiers on patrol in NI .
You 're being used - if you keep going like this it 's likely you 'll end up a member of the conties or ONH , cannon fodder for extremists .
Wise up and snap out of it .
That post barley warrants a reply .
Comic gold .
I think most people are looking at this , again , without an objective analysis of the situation .
Ever since the intervention in Afghanistan and drone attacks of Pakistan , can anyone give me a successful attack by al-Qaeda on the West since the intervention ?
Some people should know better that the United States and her allies are not on some mission to kill innocent civilians , quite the contrary .
Most of the contributions in this topic have failed to recognize that Islamic fundamentalists have been operating in Pakistan and are the root cause of terrorism in that area .
In 2006 , Pakistan saw 657 terrorist attacks leaving 907 people dead .
In 2007 , Pakistan saw 1,503 terrorist attacks , resulting in 3,448 casualties .
In 2008 , Pakistan saw 2,148 terrorists attacks , resulting in 2,267 casualties .
In 2009 , Pakistan saw 2,586 terrorist attacks , that resulted in 3,021 fatalities .
Terrorist attacks have killed over 35,000 people .
If we compare this to figure of civilian casualties ( which I will go into ) it is quite a healthy ratio as of the 1658 to 2597 killed , 385 were thought to be civilians , in contrast of the Taliban / al-Qaeda 's operations to kill civilians .
From a strategy perspective , in 2009 and 2010 , air drones were equipped with new missiles called Small Smart Weapon ( SSW ) or typically known as '@ Scorpion .
' These missiles have increased accuracy and expanded surveillance , including the use of small , unarmed surveillance drones to pinpoint the exact location of targets .
Ever since the introduction of civilian causality countermeasure technology , Bloomberg reports that 1,300 militants were killed and only 30 civilians killed in drone attacks in mid @-@ 2008 .
The New America Foundation believes that civilian casaulties have decreased from 25 % to an estimated 6 % , with a total of 18 civilians killed since August 2010 .
<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/22/world/la-fg-drone-strikes-20110222"> http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb...rikes-20110222 </a>
On the grounds of legality , according to the Geneva Convention , members of regular armed forces – involved in conflicts – are the only persons who may be considered lawful combatants and authorised to use lethal force .
The operators in Pakistan are the United States ( USAF ) and the Pakistani military .
So , who really murders more ?
Islamic fundamentalist groups total of 35,000 casualties ( since 2003 ) or the United States @' 385 casualties ( since 2004 ) ?
Hmm the real figure of civilian drone death is unkown .
Its likely to be much larger than the figure you 've quoted .
WHo cares ?
If it is 30 , 30 innocent people have died for no reason .
If a guy went and blew up 30 people in London right now it would be on the news for months , and we 'd be reminded of it for the next 100 years .
Why the double standards ?
It 's not double standards , there 's just an opportunity to save more lives albeit , at the expense of a few .
You have to negate the individual if it benefits society as a whole .
I 'm not saying it 's right , but it 's the realistic and only solution to an eroding problem in the middle east .
6 % means that a disproportionately small number of terrorist attacks were carried out by Muslims .
Secondly , 9 / 11 is not the worst thing to ever happen in history .
Of course it was utterly disgraceful , disgusting and wrong , but worse things have happened .
Perhaps it was the most devastating terrorist attack in America , but the ones that trail behind it were mostly carried out by non @-@ Muslims .
Secondly , and more importantly , for every American death at the hands of terrorists , even if you want to include non @-@ Muslim ones ( ie the majority ) , there must be thousands of deaths that America has inflicted in other countries .
Though attacks on America are not justified by this , it would be foolish to think that such aggression would not have repercussions .
And so what , was going to war worth America having access to him directly ?
Considering that if they had of just accepted indirect access , 9 / 11 would never have happened ?
I agree America has inflicted hundreds of '@ ground zeroes @' so to speak .
In the last half century America has invaded 50 countries .
Dropped nukes .
Vietnham too just pour agent orange and other such chemicals without a care into the woods .
How many civillians died there ?
THe amount the Americans killed in that country is way more than anything muslim terrorists have done .
Whose the real big baddy terrorist eh ?
I think we all know .
God , zionists really do n't give a **** about human life do they ?
Innocent people are dying and you talk **** .
What ?
thank you .
why can n't people think the same thing ?
if it was two american kids dad there would be media furore .
I did n't see these two kids names on the news ?
Yet we see soldiers who made a choice to go and fight on the news when they die .
That 's because they are our soldiers and our fellow citizens .
We are n't the ones who want to oppress fellow countrymen and use civilians as shields , while planning new ways to kill Americans .
Sure , these deaths are n't great , but only a very small minority are caused by us .
Most of the killings in the middle @-@ east are muslims killing muslims .
You can n't pin the blame on us .
right @....
does that means its okay to kill some innocent civillians ?
I mean western lives are more valuable than those of oriental weirdos right ?
Give me a break man @...
A merican CIA drone strikes are whats creating terrorism .
American intervention , illegal intervention i hasten to add is whats creating terrorism .
If i was that guys brother i would feel so so angry @....
Bull**** .
What caused the African embassy bombings ?
you pick one singular event , im talking about several events here .
THe primary cause is western foreign policy .
oh so right when the idf use human shields thats fine ?
haha palestinians , how bout the 3000 dead in the gaza war lmao .
You sicken me .
Hmm , so where is your evidence of this ?
Who reported these stats ?
Also , why do I '@ sicken @' you ?
Do n't want to see the truth , huh ?
I do n't know where you got your evidence for "@ very few civilians @" because the current death toll says otherwise .
What makes you think dropping random bombs is killing specifically muslim terrorists , wipe out everyone and you 'll get them too ?
Is that the plan ?
They are n't random attacks .
Bearing in mind the US has been free from terrorist attacks for ages , and that 9 / 11 itself was clearly not executed by a few guys sitting in a cave on the other side of the world .
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZEvA8BCoBw"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZEvA8BCoBw </a>
Ah , what good is a US bashing thread without a conspiracy theory ?
You make me laugh , twoofer .
All the evidence points to 9 / 11 being a terrorist attack and that youtube video has been debunked multiple times .
Those engineers simply crave attention .
One thing we can be sure of though is that when the US does finally stop attacking , they are going to get a taste of their own medicine eventually , because the damage they 've caused is irreversible .
They 've brought it upon themselves by being so power hungry and attracted to oil like a moth to a flame .
Oh right , so you are suggesting we keep this up indefinitely ?
Do you know how much these wars are costing us ?
Also , these wars having nothing to do with oil .
We actually got less oil out of Iraq after the war and what oil is there in afghanistan ?
So they made up the foreign policy stuff to hide their true agenda which is the hatred of the western way of life and of the world 's existence !!!
they are run by Dr Evil himself with his evil plot to destroy the world !!!!!!
This is the real world not your stupid fictional film where evil geniuses exist and want to destroy everything .
Everything he said is factually correct .
All of al-Qaeda 's actions against America have been justified by them on the basis of propagating Islam .
And you just use a bunch of exclamation marks and a Mike Meyers character , and do n't even deal with the facts he cited .
Problem is , were those drone strikes to stop you would have far more attempted terrorist attacks .
The collateral is horrible yes but if they stop al Qaeda and these other groups are n't going to say well that was very nice of America shall we all go home ?
calling deaths "@ collateral damage @" is stupid .
Lol , evidence ?
are you ****ing kidding me , google it mate .
Thats why you sicken me @...
you live in a bubble .
The bombing of the embassies started before America "@ invaded Muslim lands @" ( whatever the hell that means ) .
These radical Wahhabis hate the entire world , and even if we stopped and withdrew all troops tomorrow , they would continue to attack us regardless of foreign policy .
The only way to deal with such people is to arrange an appointment for them with their Maker .
I 'm living in a bubble ?
You are the one who takes all this '@ poor palestinians being treated like scum @' BS spewed by liberals .
Stop making stuff up and grow a brain .
At least most muslims are sane , unlike the American government who just can n't seem to stop committing terrorist acts .
Ah , this explains the daily suicide bombings in beautiful countries like iraq
hmm thats because maybe they are @...
whats your definition of being treated like scum ?
Hmm mine is @:
1 . Having your land split into lots of little pieces .
So much so that you have to go to another country to get to parts of your own country .
2 . Having even more of your partitioned land being taken for you .
3 . To make things worse have a wall being put in your land .
And your entry / exit out of this wall is controlled .
like a concentration camp in the holocaust @...
easily forgotten right ?
quick to remember it when you want to .
4 . Having white phosphorous bombs chucked on you .
5 . Having a blockade imposed on me .
They are being treated like scum you ****ing idiot .
Once again we are a country of over 60 million , less than a million protested in this country .
Now you may not be so good at maths , but I'mn sure even you can realise that the protesters were nowhere near the majority .
So the number of protesters determine whether or not they were against the war ?
What about the pensioners who could n't get out of bed or the disabled ?
What about the mothers who wanted to protect their kids if the protest turned violent ?
What about the men who had to work on that day to feed their families ?
What about the people who had the desire to protest but could n't due to prior family engagements ?
What about the people who are NOT allowed to protest ?
Once again , there is no excuse for terrorism .
Not to mention you know , that the anti @-@ war protesters were n't the ones that flew planes into buildings beforehand @...
So ?
It was the anti @-@ Imperialist .
No one listened to them and they resorted to terrorism .
Look at Northern Ireland where the British tried to enforce their rule upon others .
And yes , the world is n't great .
But what you gunna do ?
Do you want me to do something ?
What '@ actual @' perpetrators of attacks on Europe ?
nationalist attacks are incredibly rare and most of them are things like carbombs with hours of warning ( aside from Norway this year ) .
Fundamentalist Islamic attacks are designed to kill as many people as possible , nationalist / seperatist attacks generally are n't .
They 're entirely different things .
I 've never heard of a nationalist suicide bomber .
Comparing the two and suggesting that nationalist / seperatist attacks are more dangerous is ridiculous , try comparing the death tolls caused by ETA in the last 30 years compared to one attack in Madrid by Islamic fundamentalists .
Even the IRA failed to cause as many casualties on mainland Great Britain as Pakistani trained suicide bombers did in one day .
So you chucked the statistics out of the window by claiming "@ nationalist attacks are rare @" ?
At this point , I would like to mention that although nationalist attacks MAYBE rare , they nevertheless are 96.4 % more then Al Qaeda bombings .
Does giving "@ hours of warning @" make the act a bit more humane ?
It sounds like you support terrorist attacks , but with just a tiny weeny bit of warning beforehand .
Suicide bombing - Well , they see it as a more effective tool .
They want maximum casualties and the way to go about achieving that is through suicide bombing .
The attacks are going on in Pakistan because Pakistan can n't be trusted to deal with the Al-Qaeda / Taliban operatives in their country via their legal system .
If Pakistan actually wanted to co @-@ operate and help the fight against these guys then the drone attacks would n't be needed .
Instead Pakistan is still obsessed with it 's age old conflict with India and believes it needs to control Afghanistan to prevent India getting a foothold , thus it constantly funds and trains the same people it 's telling America it 's fighting .
Well , maybe people are sympathetic to the cause of Afghanistan .
People will do what they want to do .
Watch '@ Secret Pakistan @' on the BBC iPlayer , it 's an awesome two part documentary about how Pakistan has been supporting and funding these people for years .
Are you telling me that if Russia invaded , occupied and slaughtered people of England , residents of Wales / Scotland / Northern Ireland would not support and fund the English to get rid of the occupying force by any means necessary , not limited to suicide bombings ?
And the 50 million other able bodied people , who make up the vast majority , we should ignore them precisely because they are the majority ?
In NOrthern Ireland , despite how I despise the IRA , I can say surely that they did not intentionally try to kill as many civilians as possible , they did n't execute teachers who taught girls , they did n't whip people for not growing beards etc. I never agree with terrorism , but to put the IRA on the same level as AQ or Islamic insurjents just showcases your ignorance .
And if what you do is legal , then feel free to .
If you feel the urge to blow **** up , then kindly bog off to the West Bank where you will n't affect Britian .
Ta .
Sri Lanka
-- I 'm sorry what ?
Why ?
China
-- The Chinese government is ultra capitalist but it does not terrorize people at the level of invasion .
Zimbabwe
-- Mugabe is just an African Nationalist .
The country is a dictatorship but contrary to thought almost all Africa countries are independent of there government .
Life goes on regardless - the level of infrastructure is too weak , they have n't developed in the right way .
++ The only reason people dislike Zimbabwe is because he exiled the white people from Zimbabwe and ceased there land .
Yeman
-- Yemen is poor and run by an oligarchy , invade and you 'll leave with more people and more western sympathetic oligarchy .
What have you done but wast ammunition and reduce oil prices for about 2 years ( to piss of Russia ) .
Bahrain
-- O NO , the royal guard killed some violent protesters .
Lets destroy the government and solve things !!
Invading a place does n't magically create human rights , democracy and wealth .
That 's a myth propagated to the citizenry to justify wars in the interest of the government invading .
We live under the we you do because people starve and suffer elsewhere - such is the nature of he world .
Inevitable poverty .
My argument was merely that we can not intervene in every country where there exists instability and corruption .
Why do n't we intervene in North Korea ?
The same reasons we have n't intervened in many other countries who 's leaders exercise ruthless power over their citizens .
We did n't intervene when the Sri Lankan government were slaughtering the Tamil Tigers , or during the Rwandan Genocide , or when the Yemen / Syrian / Bahrain government shot at their protesters , or when Mugabe began killing opposition .
These are only recent events .
Countless over atrocities have taken place without our intervention .
Stalin , Mao ZeDong , Pol Pot , Idi Amin @...
To name but a few .
Clearly I may be wrong , feel more than welcome to correct me .
That does n't mean that they do n't benefit from the intervention .
How do they benefit from it ?
Having our companies lose millions on oil fields that they can not use ?
On the various countries being cut off from the oil ?
On having to spend hundreds of millions on a no fly zone ?
North Korea is as bad , no , i meant WORSE than Nazi Germany .
Aside from the lack of free speech , capitalism and being made to worship the leader , the country has an awfull amount of cruelty .
If an individual complains about his way of life , inadvertently says something bad about Kim Jong , or the country , then he , his children and his parents are all taken away to a concentration camp .

Amnesty estimates there to be 200,000 prisoners held in concentration camps for offences like these , there the men , women , children are held indefinetly .

So why did we interven in Nazi Germany in 1939 , and in Iraq 2002 , but not in North Korea 2011 ?
America intervened during the cold war @...
it led to the current situation .
America ceased to fight because it would have been tantamount to aggression against China , whom border the North .
China would in no way appreciate any new aggression because they prefer to have a dilapidated communist state on their doorstep when the alternative is something like south Korea , which is capitalistic , extremely pro @-@ western and essentially the antithesis of Chinese culture ; and would therefore probably alter chinese culture , or demonstrate the temptations of capitalism to its people .
Try not to think in such a simplistic and imperialistic way ; we have no right to go attacking states we disapprove of , and in this instance as i have hopefully shown , it would be extremely impractical .
Anyway , North Korea will most likely self destruct in the next decade or so .
North Korea does have oil as well as gold and coal
Not that i 've heard of @...
Then do some research
I do n't disagree .
French minister lose there most hated foreign enemy .
One oil rich vassal state .
( this is a bonus , not a motive ) · One African country that was actually in growth goes back into decline .
One less dictator .
I 'm actually happy he 's beating them off .
I watch Libyan news every afternoon ( cable ) and things are going well .
-- NATO took down the second major power station and there was a government victory demonstration in Sabha .
Hmm @..
I do n't know how I feel about this .
I do n't really know enough to have a solid opinion but I do think that the UN resolution was absolute rubbish & NATO has been nothing but a joke .
I do n't support Gaddafi at all but it 's clear that neither side could n't care less about civilians getting killed .
Another thing , I do n't think we hear much about ^ on the news either , they 're too selective over what they tell us
According to the CIA website they do n't .
they are 110 th supplier in the world .
Hardly major .
MLK talked about the war in Vietnam and how cruel it was how many people were mutilated and so on , now Obama is waging war against Libya , all people see is how he is black .
Am I the only one who sees he is crooked and a war mongerer like Bush and Tony .
He also denies Palestine statehood , he is NO CHANGE !
The picture sums him up completely .
Forgetting that Hitler killed and hated people of African / and Caribbean origin .
I do n't think having the authority of the United Nations , NATO , Libyan transnational council and Arab League .
Compares fairly with Bush and Blair 's adventures in Iraq .
But oh well , no amount of rational discussion will convince you anyway .
The international community demanded action and in response Obama sought international backing and got it .
If he had not responded and thousands of more Libyan people were slaughtered you 'd be making a thread attacking him for letting innocent people die and not giving a damn .
He can n't win with people like you .
Please propose a different solution to stopping tyrannical leaders from slaughtering their citizens indiscriminately .
Do we send them a Facebook message to surrender ?
do we make '@ important @' threads on TSR decrying their actions ?
what do we do exactly ?
watch and wait for @...
what ?
after every national , supranational and international spokesperson has demanded cease fire and for the civilians to be left alone in peace .
What the hell do we do next ?
add them on facebook ?
It was up to the Libyans to stop the dictator , not war mongering NATO .
That is what revolution is .
Ah so your solution is for the international community to watch massacres take place and if you have the will to stop it , just do nothing .
Amazing .
Thank you for ignoring the fact that NATO got permission from the UN and Arab League .
Even refusing to take action until it had done so .
Because of course this would n't fit your anti NATO agenda .
You speak like the Isreali Foreign Minister .
Try to see it from the other side too .
I try - but it 's not a simple good vs bad story by any means .
Many countries were uneasy about the decision , even China and Russia and their human rights record speaks for itself .
The UN had little time to make a decision , basically the UN should of allowed the rebels to take control on THEIR OWN .
Not any intervention , I knew it would of cost more lives and it did .
He kills people , end of .
He has blood on his hands like Bush , Blair and Bush Senior .
Give me one major world leader who does n't have blood on their hands ?
Part of the job really @...
Jimmy Carter
You have no evidence to prove that if the international community did not intervene it would have prevented more civilian deaths .
Stop acting as if you have a magical crystal ball . , because you do n't .
People can only judge the situation and weigh up the consequences of action and inaction .
You thought it was perfectly okay for the world to not take action , that 's your view but not mine .
Have any view you like .
I agree with you , but this is more complicated than that .
Jimmy Carter
He still authorised Operation Eagle Claw , that failed and ended up with the deaths of american soldiers .
Plus , this fails to mention any covert operations which we are not in public knowledge .
No , racism does n't exist anymore and , if anything , the recent downturn has brought people together for support
What ? !
You MAD ?
It exists .
If it did n't their would n't be racial attacks .
Only recently in the news a Asian man in the UK ( loads of cases ) was called "@ pa** @" and stabbed to death .
Has anyone had any personal experiences of an increase in racial tensions at all ?
I was brought up in a racist household , Personal experiences yes , Totally , Every time I 've ever been in trouble or confrontation it 's been either that of the black / asian race .
Do you see the BNP increasing their portion of the vote in the next general election ?
I hope so .
People think racism works only one way eg .
Whites being racist .

White man subjected to race attack by gang of yobs · Andrew Goodram , 31 , suffered a punctured lung and two broken ribs after the gang of four yobs shouted @: " white bastard " at him before subjecting him to a vicious assault .
During the beating Mr Goodram , a labourer , was repeatedly kicked in the head , face and body .
One of his attackers then stood over him and stamped on his chest causing was police described as "@ significant injuries . @"
The assault at Queens Park in Bolton , Greater Manchester was called off when one of the thugs said they should leave and they all ran off in different directions .
Mr Goodram , a father of two managed to stagger home after the assault where he alerted relatives .
He spent six days in hospital .
Today / yesterday as Greater Manchester Police confirmed the attack at 7 pm on October 19 was being treated as a racially motivated incident Mr Goodram who has two sons said @: "@ I was in such terrible pain after the attack , I was yelping and my eyes were watering .

" I 'm scared now and when I see groups of Asian people and this attack has changed how I feel about going out .
" When I 'm walking around especially on my own I feel intimidated and worried I might get attacked again .
The fact is I am not racist and I have got loads of Asian friends and I 'm really saddened that this has happened to me .
I do believe the attack was racially motivated because I am white but I do n't understand why . I thought we are supposed to live together in peace .
The incident occurred after Mr Goodram was taking a shortcut through the park when he encountered the group of four Asian men - who were with four friends .
As he walked past them one said @: " what did you say you white bastard ?
" before launching an attack .
Mr Goodram added @: "@ I carried on walking and put my hood up and ignored them , but then they jumped me and I was pulled to the ground . They were kicking me and hitting me and one of them twisted my arm behind my back .
"@ One of them jumped on me and , when I winced in pain , they ran off . @"
The attackers were Asian and aged between 20 and 30 .
One of the men has been described as Asian , in his early 30 s , 6 ft 2 in , of heavy build , with a bald head and a thin '@ lined @' type beard .
He was wearing a dark hooded top with tracksuit bottoms and wore white NIKE training shoes .
Mr Goodram was unable to describe the other members of the group .
Police confirmed they were searching for four men over the assault .
A spokesman said @: "@ The victim was walking through the park at about 7 pm when he was attacked by a group of Asian men .
The man was repeatedly kicked in the head , face and body , one of the men stood over him and stamped on his chest causing significant injuries .
Racist abuse was shouted at the man before the attack .
"@ One man in the group shouted for them to leave and they all ran off in different directions .
The victim has bruising to the face , head and body .
He has two broken ribs and a punctured lung .
A group of four men are wanted for the assault . @"
And this is the benefits of living with **** & piss in your community .
The historical cliche is that as the economy suffers , so politics becomes polarised and people begin to search for irrational explanations for the cause of their misery ; people need someone to blame .
Nazi Germany is often given as the shining example of this - "@ it 's the Jews !
Blame the Jews ! @"
There are obviously many important differences between 1920 s Germany and 21 st century Britain .
- Germany was raped far , far harder than Britain has been ; · - the welfare state was completely falling apart leaving people facing homelessness and genuinely terrifying living standards ; · - unemployment was something ridiculous like 8 million ; · - we 're arguably far more tolerant ( some would say too tolerant ) and educated than 70 @+ years ago ; · - Communism has gone from being a genuine threat to your life in in Germany , to being reserved for Bond films and textbooks today ; · - We have a far more stable government ; · - We have n't lived through a horrifying bloodbath of a war ; · - Other stuff I have n't though about .
Has history repeated itself in any respect do you think ?
I do n't really know so that 's why I started this thread .
I have noticed a lot of implicit and explicit racism on TSR from a vocal minority but I wonder if that 's just always been there .
I mean , have n't the Daily Mail and its readers been lambasting immigrants since the dawn of time ?
Is there anyone reading this who will consider voting BNP when they would n't have done so before ?
Just wanted to hear some thoughts on what others think .
Particularly the economic downturn 's wider historical significance .
Europe and the UK are still far more prosperous now than they were in the 1930 s .
Unemployment levels are not as severe and there is still welfare protection unlike in the 1930 s .
Also , the overall demographic of migrants in Europe today is overwhelmingly young , male , and competitive .
The indigenous European population is more skewed towards the older ( and female ) demographic .
Thus the Europeans are more likely to moan and groan than resort to violence and aggression ( predominantly a young and male trait ) .
Also , significant proportions of the 20 @-@ 35 male population in major European cities are migrant men .
I sense some satirical irony in this .
wot irony ?
wot dya mean
i would agree , especially when its comes to the jobs situation .
dey took our jerbs !!!
Well , to an extent they did .
Certainly immigration has increased competition , especially for low @-@ paid , low @-@ skilled work , and the reciprocal benefits have largely been taken advantage of by well @-@ educated white-collar workers who have had more opportunities to develop themselves and learn multiple languages .
I 'm all for a bit of protectionism when it comes to labour markets .
1 ) Yeah that 's what I said .
2 ) Interesting point that I have n't considered before .
Yeah , that 's a horrible and malicious attack which can n't be condoned on any level .
But do you think it 's fair to imply that all Asians and Blacks subject Whites to racist attacks ?
Are all white Texans members of the KKK ?
Are all Germans Nazis ?
absolutely right !
What ? !
The news has a tendency to exaggerate to catch your attention
I shall rephrase my last comment , there 's no racism with intelligent people in our society
If you know someone who is racist then either do something about it if you can or ignore them , not worth your time
Yes I think so .
I remember basically being made redundant and my boyfriend as well , being told there are no more hours for us where we worked , so it is best to just resign and look elsewhere .
In the week we were leaving about 4 new polish people were being hired in the same area that we were and them constantly being given overtime , which was a little strange .
They were all friends of the Polish manageress .
Luckily , me and the bf lived with polish people at the time and he is foreign himself , but i can see how to someone else going through that how it would really irritate them and start shifting their mindset towards immigrants and stuff .

Many people are n't poor because they 're lazy , they 're poor because they had poor educational opportunities , or because they lack some of the talents required for a high salary , such as having a high intellect or strong people skills .
More to the point , many people have disabilities or long term illnesses which harm their earning prospects .
And some people are just unlucky , and end up with damaged prospects through no fault of their own ( say if someone was born into a broken family with drug and alcohol problems , and ended up without the level of parental support required to succeed in education and then the workplace ) .
All of these things limit earning capacity , making people poor for reasons not of their own making .
To then penalise these people by potentially allowing them to die if they become ill seems to me to be cruel and heartless beyond measure .
Considering the low levels of social mobility in this country , and the increasing correlation between parental income and one 's own income , you 'd think that people might realise that some people are born with more social advantages than others , and thus can cope with misfortune more easily than others , say the cost of a major operation .
I absolutely agree with you on the subject @- what Americans fail to realise that there are are diseases that do not discriminate between poor and rich .
Besides , certain health conditions and injuries affect long term employment prospects , so some people get caught in a vicious circle @- they can n't work because they can n't afford treatment , and they can n't afford treatment because they do n't work .
When my father has injured his hand in an accident , he received all the medical help he needed , hence his hand healed properly and he can work , contributing to the economy .
If we lived in America , he would either be crippled or still paying off his debt @- thank god we are not American .
There 's only a big fuss in the US because the insurance companies are trying to protect their monopoly .
How many republicans get campaign contributions from the insurance companies ?
Money is a good motivation to lie .
It surprises me how selfish and utterly uncaring some people can be .
It reminds me of the story where a community decides to hire a private security force in their area , they then realise that they do n't really need the police anymore and so lobby to reduce taxes going towards police .
They are rich and powerful in politics so taxes are cut .
Their community thrives but the community down the road slips into chaos as the police can n't grapple with the crime due to the cuts .
The richer community then points to the poorer community and says well if you were n't lazy and controlled crime you could improve your area , get more business and money then you might be able to hire a security force yourself .
Ironic when the high crime slum is a product of the richer communities greed .
Yes , there are people that are on benefits for a reason , such as being made redundant , disabilities etc. The people i am talking about are those who choose not to work because they would rather do nothing and get free money .
Do n't tell me they do not exist , because i know a few of them myself .
As for the other reasons such as low education and poor opportunity .
I think you are indirectly insulting those with lesser intelligence than you consider adequate to get a "@ decent @" job .
My father could not read or write when he left school and still has problems with both even now .
He has worked his arse off all his life and has always payed his taxes .
He is a plasterer , which i admit is not the most glamorous of trades , and i started life being quite poor .
However , my father always payed his taxes and national insurance and has worked his way up to being the best , and most well payed tradesman in the area .
Since he started life with a lot more misfortune than most , and has still managed to pay his way and provide for his family , why can n't everyone else ?

Why would n't it mean the same when it is health care rather than food ?
The NHS led to immediate rationing , the long term effect of which has been that rich people opt out , and poor people die on waiting lists .
On a market economy , if people want more of A and less of B , demand for A will go up and demand for B will fall .
Sales of A will increase , and slaes of B will decrease , meaning more profits providing A and less providing B. This also means that providers of A will be able to raise their prices without losing sales , and supplies of B will have to drop theirs to keep sales .
The raising prices and profits in the A industry will attract new suppliers into the industry , possibly from the B industry , where falling prices and profits are encouraging people to leave .
The net result is that production of B declines and production of A rises .
So the price mechanism allows those that want more of A to tell people to provide more of it , whilst giving them a proportionate incentive to respond appropriately , and allows people who want less of B to tell providers of B to produce less of it , and gives them a proportionate incentive to respond appropriately .
Moreover , the same works for factors of production @: How would land owners know that people wanted more bread , for instance ?
The price and profit in the bread industry would rise as demand rises , telling bread makers to make more bread , or other producers to become bread makers .
This causes a rise in the demand for wheat , with the same effect .
This causes a rise in the demand for land , with the same effect .
Abolishing , or interfering with this price mechanism , by fixing prices at zero , prevents this signalling process from happening .
Consumers can not signal to suppliers that more of one thing is needed and less of another , nor provide them with a proportionate incentive to respond .
Whether or not health care proffessionals are in it for the money or for the basic desire to help , they can not know which service people want more of .
Fixing the price at zero means that demand will be higher than it would other wise be , that people will seek to get healthcare worth less to them than it costs to provide - the textbook definition of "@ over supplying . @"
The result of the whole debacle will be chronic shortages and missalocation of resources , coupled with special interest politics that will lead the NHS to be run for the benefit of those that work in it rather than those that use it .
No it is n't .
It is based on the idea that if you want something , you are entitled to go out and force people to give you money for it .
If I went around taxing people , I would be arrested for robbery or extortion .
But this is what people want the state to do to fund the NHS . It is based on the idea that people do n't own themselves but should have to pay the state if they want to use their own body and mind to produce a living for themselves , so long as the state uses this money to buy everybody healthcare .
It is based on the idea that it is OK to sacrifice one person to another .
Of course it is socialist @: It is collectively owned , not run for a profit , outside the market , supplying , in theory , "@ to each according to need . @"
Your comparison with food manufacture is flawed and misleading .
The NHS does not prevent patient choice ( one can choose to go private if preferred ) it simply means the patient does n't need to pay for that choice .
The idea that this diminishes the practice of supply and demand is false ; you can not draw parallels between food consumption and healthcare , they are fundamentally different .
Your argument that the NHS is based "@ on the idea that it is OK to sacrifice one person to another @" and "@ that if you want something , you are entitled to go out and force people to give you money for it @" is frankly , wrong .
You show negligible knowledge regarding taxation .
Most people would accept that taxation is needed to secure the stability of the country , and to implement initiatives that can not be brought about by the individual or by small parties and which require broader application by the state to be most effective .
Therefore the state is not '@ robbing @' us ; the taxpayer concedes that in the interests of good service , the healthcare system can not be fragmented and subject to condition .
The NHS was the product of liberal thinking ; it is not necessarily '@ socialist @' .
I am happy with the evil and Orwellian NHS thanks :-)
Regarding illnesses for which one is not to blame ; the question should not be "@ This is n't my fault , why should I have to pay ? @"
but rather , "@ This is n't anyone else 's fault , why should they have to pay ? @"
I 've brought this up in other forums ( Skeptic Magazine ) , and I 'll bring it up here .
Anyone interested in the Jersey Devil , Bigfoot , Skunk Ape , Yeti , and so on should check out the books by Tom Brown Jr. ( '@ The Tracker @' , '@ Tom Brown 's Field Guide to Wilderness Survival @' , '@ Grandfather @' , '@ The Quest @' , and so on ) .
This guy was , apparently , trained in the arcane arts of psychological and guerilla warfare by an Apache scout named Stalking Wolf .
Many of the sightings of the Jersey Devil in the sixties can be blamed on him and his friend Rick @--@ some Native Americans have a tradition of counting coup , which sometimes involves the theft of an intimate item and , basically , terrifying the living **** out of your enemy without killing him .
There are many secret societies that have existed in history .
The Skull and Crossbones of Yale University has members like George Bush ( Jr. and Sr. ) , the Black Dragon Tong of China , and the various ninja organizations of Fuedal Japan qualify .
I find it interesting that many sightings of strange creatures occur near tribal lands .
It would n't surprise me if there were some Native American traditions have survived .
All the best ,

Good observation Kevin @...

Me ?
No .
But a man I work with grew up in the Pacific Northwest , and says that , when he was young , he saw something which he could n't identify , but which he can n't think of anything else it could be but a bigfoot / sasquatch / whatever .
He was climbing a tree when he smelled something "@ like a wet dog on fire . @"
He looked around and there was something tall and furry facing him .
He fell out of the tree and ran home .
He says he knows it was n't a bear , even though he could n't see it clearly through the branches .
Just another anecdote .

It 's also possible that a huge bear ( with rear footprints larger than I 've ever seen in Alaska , including Kodiak Island , and without any sign of clawmarks ) was walking bipedally ( there was no evidence whatsoever of a front pawprint ) .
It 's also possible that a human walked those 20 miles up that particular , lonely trail , carrying bigfoot "@ sandals @" in order to fool any hikers that might possibly happen by , and that we never saw that person before , during , or after the trackway find .
I suppose it 's also possible that the trackway was left by a biological being other than a sasquatch ( though I can n't imagine what that might be ) , or an extraterrestrial being .
Or , the prints might have been left by a ( no !

After considering the possiblilties , I 've concluded that it was likely a sasquatch .

From your perspective , that is true .
I was writing from my perspective .
however , absence of corroborative evidence tends to suggest that BF does not exist / is a bloke in a suit .
In my case , yes .
The absence of corroborative evidence suggests that my claim is unsubstantiated .
However , other sasquatch evidence does have corroborating evidence , and it is also rejected by some on this forum as not even being evidence .
The bottom line is that some folks are satisfied with the evidence available , some want more , and some will never be satisfied without proof .

Great Dismal Swamp factoids @:
The Great Dismal Swamp is a marshy area on the Coastal Plain of southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina between Norfolk , Virginia , and Elizabeth City , North Carolina in the United States .
It is located in parts of southern Chesapeake and Suffolk in Virginia , as well as northern Gates , Pasquotank , and Camden Counties in North Carolina .
It is a southern swamp , one of many along the Atlantic Ocean 's coast which includes the Everglades and the Big Cypress Swamp in Florida , the Okefenokee Swamp in Georgia , the Congaree Swamp and Four Holes swamps of South Carolina , and some of the Carolina bays in the Carolinas .
Along the eastern edge runs the Dismal Swamp Canal , completed in 1805 .
Essential to the swamp ecosystem are its water resources , native vegetative communities , and varied wildlife species .
The Great Dismal Swamp 's ecological significance and its wealth of history and lore make it a unique wilderness .
It is one of the last large and wild areas remaining in the Eastern United States .
After centuries of logging and other human activities which were devastating the swamp 's ecosystems , the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge was created in 1973 when the Union Camp Corporation of Franklin , Virginia donated 49,100 acres ( 200 km² ) of land ; the refuge was officially established through The Dismal Swamp Act of 1974 .
The refuge consists of over 111,000 acres ( 500 km² ) of forested wetlands .
Lake Drummond , a 3,100 acre ( 13 km² ) natural lake , is located in the heart of the swamp .
Outside the boundaries of the National Refuge , the state of North Carolina has preserved and protected additional portions of the swamp , as the Great Dismal Swamp State Natural Area .
Scientists believe the Great Dismal Swamp was created when the Continental shelf made its last big shift .
The whole swamp has peat underneath .
The origin of Lake Drummond , one of only two natural lakes in Virginia , is disputed .
Scientists believe [ citation needed ] the lake could have been created by the impact of a meteoroid because it is oval shaped , looking like the impact of a meteoroid .
They think it was made by a big meteoroid like the ones that are thought to have made the Carolina Bays .
Other people [ citation needed ] believe it was made by a large underground peat burn about 3,500 to 6,000 years ago .
Indian legend talks about "@ the fire bird @" creating Lake Drummond .
There is archaeological evidence which indicates human occupation began nearly 13,000 years ago .
While all efforts to drain the swamp ultimately failed , logging of the swamp proved to be a successful commercial activity .
Regular logging operations continued as late as 1976 .
Many areas have been burned by periodic wildfires .
The Great Dismal Swamp has been drastically altered by humanity over the past two centuries .
Agricultural , commercial , and residential development destroyed much of the swamp , so that the remaining portion within and around the refuge represents less than half of the original size .
Before the refuge was established , over 140 miles ( 230 km ) of roads were constructed to provide access to the timber .
These roads severely disrupted the swamp 's natural hydrology , as the ditches which were dug to provide soil for the road beds drained water from the swamp .
The roads also blocked the flow of water across the swamp 's surface , flooding some areas of the swamp with stagnant water .
The logging operations removed natural stands of bald cypress and Atlantic white cypress that were replaced by other forest types , particularly red maple .
A drier swamp and the suppression of wildfires , which once cleared the land for seed germination , created ecological conditions that were less favorable to the survival of cypress stands .
As a result , plant and animal variety decreased .
In the late 1990 s , Prince Corporation heir Erik Prince spent part of his inherited wealth to purchase about 6,000 acres ( 24 km2 ) of the GDS to create a "@ state-of-the-art private training ground for shooters and security operators @" .
[ 2 ] His private military contracting company @—@ Blackwater Worldwide @—@ is named for the peat @-@ colored water of the swamp .
Also nearby are SEAL and Delta Force bases and the Blackwater facilities are rented out to various government agencies for SWAT team training .
The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge is located not only between two states , but also between two eco @-@ regions , allowing for a wide range of plant and animal species .
Baldcypress , tupelo , maple , Atlantic white cypress , and pine are the predominant tree species found on the refuge and support the wildlife within .
Many mammal species , including black bear , bobcat , otter , and weasel , along with over 70 species of reptiles and amphibians call the swamp home .
More than 200 bird species can be seen at the swamp throughout the year , while 96 of those are known to nest on the refuge .
Lake Drummond is the middle of activity in the swamp today with many fishermen , sightseers , and boaters .
Camping is not allowed on the refuge but is allowed on the Lake Drummond Reservation ( Corps of Engineers @' site ) which is located at the Feeder Ditch spillway .
Access to this site is by boat only .

This is for the 66 % ratio .

Look how much bigger his shoulders need to be to fit the box .
Here is the 56 % ratio , and the template for it .
Wow , good job William and great info on the swamp KK . Thanks so much .
WGBH , given your description of this event , which preceded the sighting of the presumed bigfoot , I would like to submit the possibility that you were having a hypnagogic hallucination , which sometimes occur in conjunction with sleep paralysis .
"@ Hypnagogia @" is the transitional state between wakefulness and sleep .
A hypnagogic hallucination is a dream that occurs between the REM ( dream @-@ ) state and full wakefulness .
Such hallucinations can and have been taken as real events in the minds of those who experience them .
Sleep paralysis is a condition that sometimes occurs when the brain awakens from the REM ( dream @-@ ) state , but body paralysis -- a natural part of the REM state -- persists .
This conscious @-@ yet @-@ paralyzed state is sometimes accompanied by hypnagogic hallucinations and an acute sense of danger and panic .
Distorted perceptions of one 's surroundings , and imagined objects or beings , are known and documented elements of these paralyzed hallucinations .
In the above @-@ quoted report , you say you had not eaten that day and that you became weak and debilitated from nausea .
You describe being "@ frozen @...
stuck there @" prior to being "@ curled up in the fetal position @" on the floor of the deer stand "@ for about five minutes @" .
This sounds like a description of sleep paralysis .
You also describe being alone in the woods for the first time in your life .
"@ Sudden environmental change @" is a factor that has been reported to increase the likelihood of sleep paralysis occurring .
Others include @:
* Sleeping in a face upwards or supine position · * Irregular sleeping schedules ; naps , sleeping in , sleep deprivation · * Increased stress · * Sudden environmental / lifestyle changes · * A lucid dream that immediately precedes the episode .
WGBH , if you are interested in discovering what happened to you that night in 1982 , and have an open mind on the subject , I invite you to look into sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations , and decide for yourself if the factors involved with this known and studied , but little understood , phenomenon , match your recollection of the events .
It occurs to me that you might have witnessed a bear from the deer stand and , in your waking dream state , distorted the perception into a bigfoot , of which creature you have said you were aware from television .
The feelings of panic and irrational danger that often accompany sleep paralysis have stuck with you all these years , and have led or contributed to on @-@ going feelings of unease associated with the memory .
From WebMD @: · Over the centuries , symptoms of sleep paralysis have been described in many ways and often attributed to "@ evil @" presences @: unseen night demons in ancient times , the old hag in Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet , and alien abductors .
Almost every culture throughout history has had stories of shadowy evil creatures that terrify helpless humans at night .
People have long sought explanations for this mysterious sleep @-@ time paralysis and the accompanying feelings of terror .
But sleep researchers now know that , in most cases , sleep paralysis is simply a sign that your body is not moving smoothly through the stages of sleep .
Rarely is sleep paralysis linked to deep underlying psychiatric problems .
I honestly hope this helps .
Here are some quick links to get you started in any research you care to undertake @:

NOTE @: I 've relied on wikipedia 's entries for the general wording of some of my descriptions of these conditions or phenomena , but the wiki entries are fully corroborated and supported by medical websites @' descriptions and definitions of the terms as well .
Also , I 've written an unpublished novel in which the main character experiences sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations .
I mention this to explain how I 've come to understand a little about these events beyond simply looking them up tonight on the internet .
Vortigern ,
I am at work this morning .
If I had to make a knee jerk reaction , I would say it was not sleep paralysis .
But I will study the information you provided closer when I get home tonight .
I want to be fair to you and the fine research you put into it , so it does deserve a closer look when I have more time .
Thank you so much for your effort .
Just wanted to drop out of lurking and thank you guys for this thread .
While these forums see quite a lot of discussions about the bigfoot phenomena it 's very rare to read a first hand eyewitness report .
I have little to add to the discussion though , but felt you it might be a good idea to remind you veterans that you teach us newbies something new every time .
Good to see what kind of questions that are asked and what answers that are available .
I can see why so many exotic explanations crop up to explain the elusive nature of the creature .
It 's a very troubling paradox for the eyewitnesses that they see something that they are sure is there , but is night impossible to explain rationally .
How can such a large creature , apparently seen by quite a few people in the USA , somehow withstand every attempt to gather clear evidence for it 's existence ?
I can understand why such an experience would be though to deal with .
Xblade ,
I am not going to answer condescending questions from people who accuse me of embellissing .
Been there , done that .
Yawn .
Excuse making from another footer .
Just curious , can bigfoot fly in the latest version of your story ?
I 've actually had a situation like that in the late 90 s , and my observations would be that during the actual episode , it was VIVIDLY real , I would attribute mine in that moment to what you would hear described in a haunting , but upon awakening , just me , nevermore .
Not that that is what happened with JC , just adding for a personal perspective .
I tried to get them to come with me when I went to inspect the area where the animal had been standing , because I was so terrified .
They wanted no part of it .
They had no interest in trying to confirm their own theory such as looking for bear tracks in that area ?
I usually just lurk around this site and having spent some time now reading this thread I feel the need to a least post just this one time on WGBH 's behalf .
Please keep in mind that this is only my opinion , based upon my own experiences with "@ bigfoot @-@ like @" creatures in the woods .
John is pretty brave to be posting his experience on this site , for sure , and I am duly impressed at how well he is being treated here , for the most part .
However , I just have to say that I think it is ludicrous for John to accept any other explanation for his encounter except for what it is .
He saw a bigfoot @-@ like creature .
I believe him .
I wrote a dissertation awhile back on the BFF , that I expounded on more in one of my blog writings , concerning the different personalities in the "@ bigfoot community @" .
Part of it concerned the differences between "@ believers @" and "@ knowers @" .
The difference between John and some others is that John is a "@ knower @" , not a "@ believer @" .
You can "@ believe @" all the evidence ( whether it is scientific or not ) that you want , but until you have your own sighting , you can never be a "@ knower @" .
Whether he likes it or not , John is in the class of "@ Knowers @" .
Only those who "@ believe @" in bigfoot will argue with a skeptic .
Those that "@ know @" these creatures exist will n't waste their time .
It is something like a Christian arguing with an Atheist about religion .
It is a no @-@ winner , for either side .
I am not a amateur psychiatrist , like some folks here , however I truly believe that those that claim to have had hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations must be truly weak minded to believe that malarkey and to believe that it applies to John 's experience .
( Do n't take it personal , I am not slamming anybody in particular ) .
John may be weak willed , but he sure as hell is not weak minded .
Anybody that has read his postings on the various forums / messages boards can attest to that .
You guys have been so busy sharpening Occam 's Razor in this thread that it has become a dull blade .
John has posted his encounter .
He has never wavered from what he has originally stated concerning his encounter .
I think he has done a pretty good job , considering he was 17 when it happened .
I am sure there could be more learned from him , however , his PTSD over the incident probably has closed his mind off to some of the events and he can n't recall everything .
One thing I would like to mention , that I hope John finds useful in his quest to unravel this mystery , is that based upon my own experiences with these creatures , I believe that John 's encounter involved not one , but two creatures .
These creatures hardly ever hunt singularly .
They almost always tag @-@ team .
I am not sure what the purpose is when they are foraging for plant foodstuffs , unless one is supposed to stand watch while the other eats .
When hunting live prey , one seems to always drive the prey into an ambush by the other .
I find it doubtful , that the one that John saw , put "@ the stink @" on him .
There is no indication in John 's report that the creature passed by his deer stand , before he stepped out in front of him .
Given that John was guesstimating that the creature was approximately 50 yds in front of him , I find it doubtful that any smell was being given off from the creature that John could have smelled .
I believe that the "@ stink @" that John smelled probably came from the other creature that was hiding in the brush closer to the deer stand .
( Oh , and speaking of the "@ stink @" that John got a whiff of , just like a "@ creature sighting @" , there is no way a person can ever truly describe the "@ smell @" .
It is like nothing you have ever smelled before and once you smell it , you will never forget it .
It will make your eyes water and can very well make you "@ sick to your stomach @" . )
I do n't believe these creatures are harmful to humans , however , it is not the one you see in the woods that you should be worried about , it is his partner hiding behind you in the brush that should give you cause for reflection .
I can only imagine how much more John 's reaction would be if he ascertained that another creature was closer to the deer stand during his encounter .
Of course , like I said earlier in this post , these are only my opinions , base upon my own experience with these creatures .
I am not here to post about my experiences .
Just to give John some "@ food for thought @" concerning his own encounter .
The only other thing that I would tell John is that I would n't let a bad experience when I was 17 keep me from going out and having some fun in the woods .
I think you should buck up , go out into the woods , find the sucker and kick him in the ass !
So i am considered by you to be "@ truly weak minded @" well that 's a confident statement from someone that considers himself to be "@ not even an amateur psychiatrist @"
Everyone who has been asking me to describe the smell , Pywacket just described it very well .
I am sorry , I need to take a break from answering these questions right now .
No one has done anything wrong , my health is not good at the moment .
I apologize and I thank you for being kind .
I will be OK soon and return .
Take care of yourself dude
Why would Billy be mad at you for going alone ?
Should n't he be freaking out with happiness ?
I was just at the most stunning lake and as I was heading into the area I checked a sign board with some info about the lake .
There was a notice that a huge black bear had been seen on one of the trails only three days before .
We found a women 's sunglasses ( kinda big with sequins on them ) and keys there .
We were wondering how they got there and joked we might see the bear coughing out a hair extension and a broken Beyoncé CD .
It 's like the whole general discussion section and the research section Basically everywhere that I was regularly posting in and one of the people whom I was respectfully and civilly interacting with and who do not mind polite and reasonable skeptics might ask where the heck I went .
Would n't that be weird to remove from public view the entire general discussion section as well as the research section ?
Also weird that they never returned my email seeking clarification on the nature of my removal .
Oh well .
Interestingly Washingtonian in his email called it a suspension of my account but this makes it pretty obvious @:

Luckily I saved many of my posts there to my email for future refence .
I realized when I had a post removed from a thread on the Freeman cast collection politely asking why we could not discuss whether or not we thought the casts from an admitted hoaxer were legitmate that I was in a highly bizarre situation with a Bigfoot enthusiast ( Melissa ) behaving very weirdly @:
That 's fine , though .
I knew she was very irritated and wanted me gone .
She cheerleaded Lyndon when he showed up to debate with me and then when he said he gave up and did n't feel like staying she really seemed irritated .
That 's what happens when you are heavily biased and can n't handle healthy discussion and debate regarding a simple black and white zoological question .
Anyway , this is OT .
I will discuss it more in an appropriate thread .
I literally thought when I was at those falls that John would go nuts if he could see this place .
It was PNW rainforest on steroids .
I Thought that the PNW consists of temperate Rainforests only ?
You thought wrong , and you did n't do any research .
First we need to know what you consider to be the PNW .
Billy just worries about me because he has seen me freak out in the woods plenty of times .
I am sure deep down he is happy , but he wants me to understand I should not go out alone as inexperienced and scared as I am .
When I told him it was just a park he calmed down .
Billy was right .
NC is a bear hotspot and the big ones are near the coast .

"@ The next morning I decided to stalk the bear , @" Rose said .
"@ I used cover along ditches to sneak to the field .
I shot the bear with a . 270 at 175 yards . @"
The bear weighed 635 pounds .
After drying , the skull scored 21 , making the All @-@ Time Boone and Crockett record book .
"@ The bear was a short distance from Dismal Swamp Refuge , @" Rose said .
"@ That may have helped him get so big . @"
Robert Norville is the commission 's District 2 wildlife biologist .
Norville said the biggest bears in the state occur along the Pamlico County @-@ Beaufort County line .
"@ I remember last year one party brought in a pair of bears that were almost identical and the bears weighed around 450 pounds each , @" Norville said .
"@ One we checked at the Pamlico @-@ Beaufort line weighed over 600 pounds .
For the largest bears in the state , Hyde and Beaufort counties have been swapping bragging rights during recent seasons . @"
As good as the mountain hunting can be , hunters kill more bears in the coastal region , and bear weights are also heavier .
I would vote that an inexperienced kid got sick in the woods and collapsed , and when he began to recover he saw a big bear standing up and feeding in the distance and blew it out of proportion from being scared and sick and worried and a bit confused about what happened to him .
Apparently one of the biggest American Black Bears ever recorded was a male from North Carolina that weighed 400 kilograms @...
Interesting fact .
I would not have thought that .
Most of the black bears I have seen in VA and NC have been small .
Now the ones in PA were huge and more prevalent .
Or WGBH could have seen a Bigfoot .
He either saw it or he did not see it .
Lets focus on both explanations .
I was born and raised in Scioto County Ohio on a large farm in a very rural area near the Shawnee State Forest and do not recall any sightings .
All of us boys roamed the woods both hunting and just for fun ; in the winter with the snow on a favorite game was to let someone have a 10 minute head start and then track him .
We never saw BF tracks .
In no way was I relating bear sightings to bf sightings .
I was just commenting on Kitakaze 's question "@ Where are bears ? @"
My family has spent upteen thousand hours in Washington county woods and no bf there either .
Or bear .
I like to hear about species returning to areas and I know many interested in "@ bf like @" stuff do to .
WGBH , · I have an acerbic tone , I admit .
( three strokes has interfered with my brains · checks and balances , so to speak , among other things ) .
I apologize .
But what I have said I stand behind .
What about Archangels proposal ?
ap
So nothing solid regarding cougars ( though there are bobcats which people could mistake for cougars ) .
As for the wolves , how reliable is that information you have regarding the shot dead animals ?
If confirmed that would be an example of an extirpated species returning to an area it once inhabited .
I think you might agree this is a very far cry from massive undiscovered wood apes loping about Salt Fork State Park tossing rocks over by where the pavilion is , would you not ?
wolves bodies are i dep hands , guess that depends how paranoid you are
I have heard the same from many friends who live there in Ohio .
There are not that many bear sightings .
We see lots of bear here in VA and in NC . When I went to PA we saw bears everywhere .
No worries and no need to apologize .
What was archangels proposal ?
I guess I need to scroll up and read it .
Edit @: I scrolled up about 4 pages and could not find it .
It was shown on the page just before this one .
Here it is again @:
Actually , just to clarify my position I have no idea what he smelled and do n't want to say that it might 've emanated from a bear .
I just feel that a physical source of odour can not be ruled out as less likely than a hallucinated one .
I do have to ask for some clarification from someone who knows the area in question , the swamps I 've been to here in Australia all smell bloody awful for the most part does the one in question have a similar sort of odour ?
As I understand it the odour that occurs in swamps can be attributed to the rotting vegetation and animals , coupled with the moistness of the area .
The rotting process can lead to build ups of noxious smelling gases , especially if trapped under the usual layer of mud that is in a swamp .
If expelled this could create a small pocket of less oxygenated air , which could potentially have a foul smell ( ie swamp gas ) .
The lack of oxygen in the area could bring on some of the symptoms that WGBH described ( ie nausea etc. ) and if he was feeling faint enough it 's also possible that he may have started to hallucinate things .
It could also explain why the rest of the group did not smell anything by the time they got back , it had dissipated .
Note @: · I 'm not claiming this is what happened , nor that it 's even likely just that it might be another possible explanation .
Ah , I missed that , I must have been hallucinating .
Thanks for that Kit .
We were not in the swamp proper but the property was near the border .
Nevertheless , The smell did have a bit of that swampy methane odor mixed in with the wet dog , rotting flesh smell .
Did I smell swamp gas and hallucinate ?
I would answer that the same way I have the other theory 's submitted .
Anything is possible , but I find it unlikely .
I will admit that it is more likely then a sleep or brain disorder .
I guess this is another thing I ask the park officials if I can ever get down there .
We are getting swamped ( pun intended ) at work and it is hard for me to get away .
After reading this entire thread I want to say bravo kids you 've done a credible job at maintaining a level of decency !
I think the fireworks are about to launch Crow and I have fallen into their clever trap !
eep !
Hello John I 've been over to your site and bringing your encounter here while not the easiest place in the world to navigate through the personalities is not a place where kindness in the form of humoring as a kindness is going to fill you up with empty calories .
Whatever calories of knowledge you get will be the kind that will give valid energy .
I do not look for kindness here Crow .
I look for ideas .
I do not fear what their opinions are .
While I 've never seen a Sasquatch and have grave reservations that they managed to hold on into the last quarter of the 20 th century maybe they did , apparently your 's did at least .
Perhaps you did see a bipedal unclassified ape munching leaves in the forest .
After all if it lives it eats .
The only point I have contention is the overall size of the creature .
For decades I simply took at face value the size reports .
Some of which you know are simply stupendously big .
However I took the time recently to scale some sasquatch to various sized and when I brought up a 12 ft sasquatch next to a 5 @'@ 9 @" man it became clear to me that anything that big would be cutting a pretty wide swath through its environment .
So my only question is was it really that big ?
Do you think your 9 footer may have been somewhat smaller say 7 @' @-@ 8 @' which is still huge .
I saw what I saw .
No I am very sure it was well above 8 ft and probably 9 ft . I played soccer for 20 years .
A soccer goal is 8 ft . It was well beyond that .
I could see where its head was compared to the tree .
Also there has been issue with the amount of detail you may have seen at 50 yards .
I do n't have any issues at all with the details you may have seen .
50 yards is 150 ft . The driveway leading up to my studio loft is 50 yards long .
From there I can easily make out details passersby in the street .
150 @' is not a huge distance by any means .
Also you saw that animal through 17 year old eyes .
At 17 my eyes were pretty sharp .
I suspect that the majority of posters here are considerable older than 17 and it is unfair for shall we say middle agers 35 @-@ 55 yrs to discount what a pair pair of 17 year old eyes are capable of seeing at 150 @' .
There were details I could not see very well Crow .
Such as the eyes and the fingernails .
Also , It may have been less then 50 yds. It was just an estimate and I was 10 ft up in a tree , so that could make it seem farther then it was .
I could see the back , shoulders , arms and hands well .
My eyes were always sharp .
I just started wearing glasses two years ago and I am 44 .
Basically that 's about all I wanted to say .
I hope in the end this forum and your own research helps to sort it out for you .
I hope so to and thanks .
Excellent discussion , even if it is about Bigfoot .
Poignant @-@ irony @-@ makes @-@ me @-@ reconsider @-@ my @-@ perceptions hilarious or quirky @-@ throwaway @-@ Seinfeld @-@ style @-@ observational @-@ humour hilarious ?
I was shooting for the former .
Dude ™ , it 's been both hilarious @-@ es , and that 's a good thing .
Is there some kind of award we can bestow on you when you do yet another terrific and so ******* funny job of repulsing those pesky ( but ) ProBigfooters ™ ?
Seriously , your craftsmanship is impeccable .
The fact you still have WGBH 's '@ attention @' is surprising , even if obvious why . I mean ( and I mean it respectfully ) , he 's still stalled on '@ he saw Bigfoot @' .
Actually , it is true that WGBH has transformed ( and possibly redeemed ) himself from a literal BFF '@ forum troll @' to an almost famous and esteemed member of the entire Bigfoot Community ™ , pro and con .
Gotta respect that .
Maybe when WGBH finally does realize there is no Bigfoot , and he will , Kitakaze will be first in line for yet another of those awards we decided in the paragraph above to regularly give him ?
We can only pray .
[quote=WGBH;4819035] I hope so to and thanks .
[ / QU
I was n't aware I was being mean or nasty to you .
I can pull up the many compliments and words of support I 've been offering you but I do n't think I 'll find anything mean or nasty .
That is the problem Kit , you can n't even recognize the hurtful things you say .
Before you ask me to "@ prove my claims @" by copying and pasting them , I am not interested in that argument , I can deal with it .
You know when I lost my temper and why I did it .
I told you right here on this forum .
Do n't play coy .
I posted that quote on SFB in a attempt to diffuse a situation that Crow may have started that I did not want .
I was making light of the situation by saying I am OK and I can handle myself here on the JREF fine .
That is all I intended .
It was not a attack on you and it was a mistake to use your name .
I do n't believe that not thinking you really saw a 9 x 6 ft monster wood ape amidst the civilization of the Virginia / North Carolina state line qualifies as being mean or nasty .
I mean , come on .
Look at the place we 're talking about .
An alleged encounter in 1982 first reported in 1998 after a long bout of alcoholism and being discussed 27 years later .
I think there is a lot of room for perceptual distortion there but that 's just me .
You have made this opinion very clear .
I get it .
Your comment at SFB really does n't seem fair to me .
I understand , but see my above comment .
I 'm a little let down that you would speak that way about me when I 'm not around .
I 've liked you since we first got into constructive debate at you SFB and you told Melissa and others to chill out and realize I 'm not trying to be insulting or make things personal when I am debating Bigfoot issues .
But you are not around there Kit .
You were thrown out for behavior not wanted on that forum by its owner .
The fact that you or I may not agree with those rules is not the point .
If you want to post there you abide by them .
You have no idea how many times I attempted to defuse the situation regarding you and the rest of the admin .
I argued on your behalf on the admin forums constantly .
Only for you to turn around and do the same things you were warned about again and again .
You took it out of my hands Kit .
News flash , If it was not for me you would have been tossed long before you were .
Oh well , I still wish you luck on your road to freedom from irrational fear and nightmares .
Thanks
John , maybe you or someone can pass on to log that despite her little spazzo meltdown flip @-@ off to Serenity .
No Kit , I DO NOT like to pass things from forum to forum , but I was forced to above .
I reject it not only on my opinion , but the opinion of a professional .
Please do not expect me to comment on it publicly .
You just did .
Hint @: If you do n't want to talk about things on a public form then do n't mention them .
Hint @: I meant the diagnosis .
Yes , and you guys at back @-@ to @-@ sleepy SFB can split your PGF Munns thread into a "@ whine about JREF skeptics @" thread .
You 're right .
All my stuff about SFB / ABS / Melissa and friends is pretty OT .
I do n't feel particularly bad about it because whenever I try to discuss why you could n't have had a sleep @-@ related occurrence or distorted memory we get about as far as "@ I saw what I saw @" .
You and everyone here can discuss your opinions about my encounter all you want .
I listen to all of them , but I am not required to subscribe to them .
If there 's any complaint , I could maybe try something lame and say "@ well did n't the ABS think they might have seen Bigfoot eyeshine ? @"
The key word there is "@ might @" .
Eyeshine is not proof .
And we do not · submit it is such .
You are confusing someone telling about a experience on a radio show as submitting it as evidence .
Speaking of lame .
I know , not much finesse .
What I find frustrating about situations like this is that I have a conflict between not wanting to be OT ( even in a more open thread like this ) and adding yet another Bigfoot thread to the pile while more than a few are active .
With all the silliness that happened with Bullet Maker doing a lemming run off the face of Bigfootery , I 've kind of been giving poor Darren Lee and the MABRC a break and Melissa and friends kookery have put the ABS in my sights , particularly with what a gong show the SFSP expedition was .
May be I will start a thread similar to my MABRC threads and call it "@ American Bigfoot Society - The Mild Bunch . @"
If I do , I expect you to do a good job handing it back to the "@ scoftics @" .
Kit one of the first things you and I ever spoke about regarding Bigfoot was Mr Bilby and his hoaxing .
You do understand that most in this field never bought into anything he said or did , correct ?
He admitted hoaxing to me , · I posted it for all to see , and he is done and good riddence .
Please do not infer that the ABS has anything to do with hoaxing by comparing us to Bullet maker .
That is really crossing a line .
You know that none of us in the ABS will stand for hoaxing .
You may continue your silly personal attacks on mself or the research techniques applied , but do not go there .

*@ Miss Swan @* John , you make a funny !
You crazy !
Oh , you make a me laugh !
*@ Miss Swan @*
Well , you throw them down the middle of the plate and I will hit it out of the park @...
Why , yes .
Yes , John , I did pick and choose what posts I put in my response .
Maybe it had something to do with the fact that all of those posts by other members who were n't skeptics and were making reference to Paul Freeman 's hoaxing preceeded any post that I and then HarryH made .
Hello , McFly ?
Is this thing on ?
Your claim @:
"@ The people who were commenting about hoaxing from the beginning were you and other sceptics @...@ @"
Oops for you .
That was n't true , was it , John ?
Shall I post the post numbers and exact times and dates that those Bigfoot enthusiasts like Henry May , Creekfreak , and Reverend Stone made those posts so you can see exactly how long before my and Harry 's comments they were ?
I would just tell any person who is n't banned to just go over and see for themselves but uh oh , Melissa turtled her board and put all new accounts on preview .
Oh noes @...
mehbeh more skaptiks r cuming .
They were not disrupting the thread like you were .
I should have said disrupting and not commenting .
Strone only said he will make up his own mind and did not mention hoaxing .
And I find it hilarious that you would quote and use Creek Freak to defend yourself , especially since you attack him constantly for being a hoaxer .
So I guess that we can say that YOU support a hoaxer too right Kit ?
Hypocrite .
So that leaves Henry and he only mentioned it , he did not disrupt the thread .
You mean another Bigfoot enthusiast who posts in another Bigfoot board felt uncomfortable with me pointing out exactly what such a massive collection of casts by Freeman implied ?
For example , that he would have casted at least 26 individual Bigfoots in his small area alone ?
No I mean an administrator from the largest Bigfoot forum noticed you acting like a troll as you normally do .
Being warned by a Bigfoot enthusiast groupie for pointing out the obvious in a civil manner in discussion where the comments are perfectly relevant worries me not .
And acting like a troll , scoftic will get you banned , and it did .
Actually no .
John .
I 'm simply pointing out that your claim that no ABS member tolerates hoaxers is simply a fantasy .
It 's not about whether or not casts are evidence of Bigfoot .
That 's solely your opinion , not in line with that of Meldrum , Melissa , and a throng of other Bigfooters , and a diversion tactic to try and steer away the conversation from your claim .
It is all about opinion and yours is no more relevent then anyones .
including mine , silly boy .
I do n't think it was a travesty that Melissa kicked me out .
Neither do most of the members there .
Says the guy who repeatedly ignores requests to address the simplest questions regarding his sighting while engaging in the topic he complained about as OT .
I 've lost count how many times John ignores this @:
You are confusing ignore for disregard .
Go ahead and ignore me , John .
OK
John @- You abstained from voting for the banning of Kitakaze .
And you act like it was a gesture to show that you did n't really want him banned .
I 'm just curious what your voting record is on past bannings .
Have you voted to ban people before ?
, Have you abstained before ?
, Have you voted not to ban people before ?
Abstaining from voting in this case , might be a big deal if you always vote yes or no , on banning , but it would n't be a big deal if you ALWAYS abstain from voting for banning .
NOWHATIMEAN ?
It does n't sound like you 're saying you were the one that lifeted Bateman 's art .
BTW , this is not the first time there 's been an issue about Melissa 's site using art without permission , is it ?
That 's rhetorical , you do n't have to answer .
What I know is that it ended up being a major league catfight for many people myself included and I wasted mucho energy trying to stay out of it last year so thats about my input on it .
I will n't go even more OT with MABRC or NESRA stuff but I really like the head of your group , Chris Bartow .
I 've had friendly and helpful discussions with him in the past .
Actually Chris is one of four board members for the Group , as am I just to clarify but i appreciate you not dragging Nesra into this subject , it really has nothing to do with them .
Matters with Anderholm are considered ancient history also , fwiw .
It was not in support of his troll behavior .
I just do not support banning anyone and would not do it unless someone threatens another member .
I was content to just edit his posts .
Some people do not have the patience for that and he was banned .
I have not been involved with any other ban of a member there , we have not had any since I was a Mod or Admin .
The majority of the members can behave like adults .
Kitz , are you banned from the bff ?
Because i see alot of members here are banned .
Oh well , must be the mean ol @' scientists who ruin 's everybodys favorite imaginary biped .
Just my opinion , but the BFF is whole separate political hornets nest .
Americans and foreigners of the muslim faith were murdered on 9 / 11 .
These muslims are as much victims of the islamist terrorists as all the others , the Christians , the Jews , the Hindus , the Atheists .
Muslims in lower Manhattan go to a mosque or prayer room there , because that 's where they live ot work .
These Muslims are New Yorkers !
Just like all the others @: The Christians , the Jews , the Hindus , the Atheists .
When the planes crashed , when the towers fell , there were tens of thousands of muslim New Yorkers in downtown Manhattan , very nearly becoming victims of the atrocities .
Now Chewy_Defense wants to make these New Yorkers , these victims of 9 / 11 , victims again .
Victims of past terrorists , and victims of future terrorists .
Up to this point , excellent post .
From this point on , crap .
Chewy_Defense seems to hate the freedom that the Constitution grants to all Americans .
Bull .
He 's shown no signs of hating anyone or anything .
He respects Constitutional freedoms but sees possible harm to NYC should the full extent of those freedoms be exercised by building this Muslim complex .
Like you , I think he is 100 % wrong but all he is doing is expressing the fact that his values within those freedoms indicate a different course of action .
That 's all .
Chewy_Defense wants the terrorists to win .
It 's like he allows them to piss on the graves of muslim New Yorkers .
More bull .
He does not want the terrorists to win and your just throwing flame bait to make the claim .
He identifies one possible harm and wants to minimize the chances of that happening .
Now you and I disagree with him on the potential of that happening and the concomitant damage that will occur if his solution is implemented but that in no way implies his desire for a terrorist victory .
Shame on you .
I 'm still waiting for JihadJane 's answer , as to why Al Qaeda attacked the USA on 9 @-@ 11 @-@ 01 .
Do you agree with mine ( above ) ?
TAM
Maybe I should have split the two parts .
The latter is mocking Chewy 's "@ arguments @" .
I do .
More or less .
I 'd explicitly mention US support for non @-@ democracies like the monarchies of Saudi @-@ Arabia , Jordan , Morocco , or the de-facto @-@ dictatorship of Egypt .
They attacked in large part because of ( A ) USA 's relationship / defense of Israel , and ( B ) the perceived USA Invasion , both Physically ( as seen in Kuwait ) and mentally of the middle east ( as seen in the United Emeriates ) , etc. @..
TAM
And at the same time declared war on the Saudi king because he allowed us bases in the holy kingdom to help us fight Gulf War 1 and for us to defend the kingdom .
I agree with it also ; pro @-@ Israel / Mideast presence .
Their hating our freedoms had very little , if anything , to do with it .
Plus KSM had an extreme hatred toward Americans from his college experience in North Carolina .
where is JihadJane 's answer ?
Can you really blame him on that one ?

Well they devote space every week to David Brooks to write tripe like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/17/opinion/brooks-the-jeremy-lin-problem.html"> this </a> .
Jeremy Lin is anomalous in all sorts of ways .
He ’s a Harvard grad in the N.B.A. , an Asian @-@ American man in professional sports .
But we should n’t neglect the biggest anomaly .
He ’s a religious person in professional sports .
He posted an opinion about their opinion piece ?
My opinion @: · It seems that the writer of the NYT op @-@ ed would be OK with a fascist one @-@ party state - just as long as they mostly did what he considered would make the nation great .
His main point seems to be that you can justify restricting democracy as there are objective "@ right @" courses of action , which the powerful can perceive but the hoi @-@ polloi are too ignorant to appreciate .
( Consider me underwhelmed )
He also appears not to value highly @: · a ) the right to disagree with him ( aka what right would he have to force his policies on an unwilling majority ) · b ) Cut down corruption and keep politicians responsive by the threat of not re @-@ electing them .
Far from being dogma , point ( b ) , when combined with transparency , is a very practical tool for encouraging good governance .
Point ( a ) may somewhat be considered dogma @...
but to ignore it would be to throw away vast amount of equal rights / equal protection ethics and law .
In my opinion , his opinion ai n't worth the paper its written on .
( And that 's plenty bad as the NYT ai n't worth much at all ) .
Are you reading his mind ?
You 're trying to argue a strawman .
Supporters of the US ( such as myself ) will say @: supporting unsavory regimes may or may not be justifiable , i.e. aid given to Stalin in WW2 - despite him being '@ orrible - was arguably the lesser evil .
When we view Chinese oppression ( i.e. at Tiananmen Square ) there does n't seem to be , what we would consider , a moral justification for it ( unlike some US actions / aid given during WW2 and the Cold War ) .
Note @: that does n't mean that the US always made the right decision , or that said support always turned out for the best , but it was intended to and often did .
Unlike the Chinese regime - which appears to simply value the amoral pursuit and retention of power .
You seem to be using the exact same argument you say is strawman !
The article itself does not say the Tiananmen Square atrocity was a good thing , what he argues is that it "@ was arguably the lesser evil @" , which is the exact same argument you use to say why you will support at times regimes that commit atrocities .
As I said above it 's an "@ the ends justify the means @" argument .
And America 's Tiananmen ?
The Bonus Army attacks ?
Was that necessary too ?
None of which addresses the question , what exactly about the American form of government makes it proveably superior to what actually worked to get a billion people from the primitive conditions of the mid 20 th century to China 's status today ?
And for me being a pragmatist this is very important to understand .
I feel that my democracy ( warts and all ) is "@ better @" but lets say look at something that I consider very important in my society i.e. social mobility .
It is hard to argue with the empirical fact that the government in China over the last two decades has done more to enable and promote social mobility than has been possible under my preferred system over the same period .
It may well be that my preference is fundamentally no different to the fact most Christians are born into Christian families .
The article is rather silly .
It contends that democracy is young and that therefore history favors dictatorial systems of government .
In doing so it ignores such facts as that the world changed in the past 100 years by more than it has changed in the previous 6000 - or indeed that the Chinese system it praises produced - just in the past 60 years - two major upheavals , one of which ended up as the greatest humanitarian disaster in history .
It also ignores the fact that the rise of China coincides perfectly with their shift towards a more western model of economy .
It 's patently ridiculous to claim their system is superior because it produced better economic results in the past three and a half years .
Well , for one it did get approximately a billion people from the primitive conditions of the mid 18 th century to Western status today .
That counts ?
McHrozni
On what planet did America have a billion citizens and progress 2 centuries in a little over 50 years ?
And right there is the whole problem I have with those who argue in favor of America 's policies towards Saddam .
The priority of his transgressions is determined not by net human suffering caused by him , but rather by whether supporting him benefits the U.S. or not .
Personally , I 'd argue that by far and away one of his "@ main transgressions @" was the attempted genocide of Kurds , and the use of banned chemical weapons in doing so .
But you see , those Kurds made the silly mistake of not being American citizens @...
so their attempted genocide is a "@ minor transgression @" which can easily be swept aside .
The issue is not one of priority but in the timeline of how events unfolded .
Saddams @' chemical attacks and genocide against the Kurds happened just before the end of the Iran @-@ Iraq war .
US support for Iraq quickly dried out afterwards , and left Iraq alienated from their key ally .
You were told so before .
Unless you 'll claim that the US would have to foresee this years before the events took place you will need to address this issue .
As to the relevance to this particular debate , it is n't the specific action , but rather the mentality behind it .
If one argues that "@ the end justifies the means @" , and that supporting Saddam was justifiable because of some distorted idea of a "@ greater good @" , then other governments have exactly the same prerogative to engage in abuses and atrocities , so long as they believe that it brings about some kind of "@ net benefit @" , otherwise known as the "@ It may be bad , but if we had n't done it , it would have been worse @" argument .
How about this - the ends sometimes justify the means .
In the case of Iran @-@ Iraq war , supporting Saddam prevented a rise of a fanatical muslim power bent on domination in a critical region of the world .
In the case of Tiannmen square , the massacre prevented @...
what exactly ?
Political reform that would end in somewhat lower economic growth for the next decade or two ?
The discrepancy is so huge I can easily say that the ends justify the means in one case and do not in the other without applying any double standards .
Thus @...
if it is okay for the U.S. to support despotic regimes because it benefits American interests , then it is likewise okay for China to support despotic regimes because it benefits Chinese interests .
And if it is wrong for China to do it , then it is wrong for America to do it .
Of course it is , but when viewed in the proper context , it is quickly evident that US support for Iraq is radically different from anything China is doing .
Point out US support for Pinochet or Franco or South Vietnam if you will , those actually have significant resemblance to what China is doing .
I 'm not taking sides .
I 'm standing resolutely in the middle , saying that both sides are wrong -- and that confuses the hell out of those who see the world in black @-@ and @-@ white .
I can sympathize with that , but you picked an entirely wrong example .
McHrozni
So your argument is what @...
that Chinese censor their newspapers , so America should do the same ?
That it 's wrong for a newspaper to have an opinion piece that expresses opinions contrary to your own ?
An idiotic argument on the face of it .
But I did n't make that argument !
So @...
you 'll close your eyes , plug your ears , and go "@ nanananana @...
I 'm not listening to you ! @"
Again , an idiotic argument .
Strawmanning , are we ?
Regardless of your personal opinion of it , this is a perspective shared by a significant number of people in the world @...
and understanding it is far , far superior to saying , "@ I do n't like it , so it is wrong to express it @" .
Except that I did n't say so .
Congrats @...
idiotic argument number three !
Since nowhere did I say that you are expected to agree with the article , or believe that the Chinese gov't is '@ better @' .
The only issue here is that the New York Times , and any other newspaper , not only has a right to print such things ( and not face the same kind of censorship that is practiced in China ) , but that printing such articles is good specifically because it expresses a view that while not mainstream in the U.S. , is a dominant view in China .
And understanding how other people think is the first step towards improving communication and relationships @...
as opposed to @...
oh @...
I do n't know @...
simply declaring that anyone who says anything you disagree with should be silenced , or has no legitimate right to express their views .
I had two major points with my post .
One to cast light on that such articles are not permitted to be printed in China , but in the US , and perhaps some conclusions can be drawn from that .
Second , to reject the notion that the options are either Chinese government or American government , and particularly the US is not the only democracy , and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index"> not even the most democratic country </a> .
Both of which you completely missed ( or at least did n't bother to address ) .
Enough of this .
You know , I do n't agree with many here , ( thankfully . )
I 'm quick to point this out for several reasons , not the least of which being that I am not always right .
I enjoy a good political rhubarb as the next person , but this is getting out of hand .
( And some of you thought Claus was bad ! )
To put it bluntly , this kind of behavior is precisely the kind of thing the Koch Brothers or Bill Maher get accused of @: belittle the opponent , degrade their humanity , malign the intent of their opponents , and on and on .
I get a little tired of it , particularly since there 's little reason for it .
It accomplishes little .
I do n't agree with Jon Stewart , yet I can n't help but laugh as the guy takes on everyone from Nancy Grace to Newt Gingrich .
He 's not only fair , he 's accurate .
He does n't need strawmen to make his point @: The facts do it for him .
No , we do n't have a political system like China 's .
I 'm grateful for that .
But there are elements of tactics which the Chinese use which make me cringe , and some of these are utterly useless and barbaric .
And ultimately , they drive away posters I want to hear from on issues where we might disagree and , ( dare I say it ) , where I might be wrong .
I 'm glad there are those of you who have never made a mistake in your political beliefs .
Good for you .
No doubt your track record demonstrates we ought to be kneeling at your kiln @-@ baked toes and heeding your every word .
The rest of us have had to make mistakes and learn from them .
It 's how I learned to drive a truck , and it 's still how I 'm learning .
Interestingly enough , I used to be ashamed of not having taken a driving course .
On the other hand , in some ways , I 'm a better driver than some for having had to learn it the hard way , and having had to take my knocks .
It has n't been easy , and some of the lessons have been expensive .
None , however , have resulted in injury or death .
It 's a lot more than I can say for some of the jokers I 've worked with who took extensive driving courses .
( Including the guy who rear @-@ ended a city bus , then blamed the passengers for taking too long to board . )
Just a reminder @: I 'm about to become a business owner .
One way or another , it 's going to happen .
I realize in the parlance of one board member , this will make me a "@ right @-@ wing ( capitalist ) drongo , @" but it 's also going to make me an employer .
Perhaps not right away , but eventually .
There 's a lot to learn in this path , and I 'm still trying to feel my way through .
Easy ?
No .
Mistakes ?
Bound to be many .
I 'm in a country which will allow me the option to make them .
I 'll take that .
I do n't expect anyone to agree with me .
But at some point or another , I 'd like the opportunity to be heard , without being belittled for it .
There are a lot of times when recognizing you 're ignorant comes after you 've put that ignorance on display .
It 's called "@ learning . @"
No one ever said it would be easy .
Although when a thread gets to the point of being more a pissing match than an opportunity to learn what others think , unsubscribing is very easy .
Here you go and make this great post , and it appears that everybody just ignored it and wen right back to bickering @...
Well , I want you to know , i read it man .
Well said .
Perhaps you could try to fully explain your position properly next time instead of leaving it open to interpretation .
I thought I did , but Wolfman left the thread apparently .
It 's been a long time since I saw the show , but from what I recall , I did n't take away that message from it .
I just remember it being about a father trying to find out what really happened to his daughter , and Joe Don Baker 's radioactive act of revenge towards the end .
I also recall it being a very well @-@ made program .
It is indeed great !
Especially Bob Peck 's acting , as Ronald Craven , and the character Darius Jedburg ( I am guessing this is Joe Don Baker ) .
You 're also right that it was about Bob Peck 's uncovering of stranger and stranger circumstances behind his daughter 's death but throughout the series he is "@ visited @" by his daughter who was , in life , some kind of environmental activist for a group called "@ GAIA @" who tells him some story about "@ black flowers @" which somehow kill everyone off .
I think at some point Jedburg says he saw the same flowers in Afghanistan and thinks there may be some truth to this .
It is somewhat subtle and I probably would n't have noticed it had I not watched it recently but it is , I think , something of the moral message to the TV series .
I agree though , that the series was really well @-@ made .
Looks like I 'm not the only one who 's been reminded of it either @:

Exactly .
I 'm sure this has come up already but could someone tell me , in a nutshell , what was so disastrous about Three Mile Island .
I 've known the name for a while as the name of an extraordinarily bad event but I have n't found any references to casualties in my ( albeit ) cursory search .
§ The plant is safe now and will stay safe .
§ Japan is looking at an INES Level 4 Accident @: Nuclear accident with local consequences .
That is bad for the company that owns the plant , but not for anyone else .
§ Some radiation was released when the pressure vessel was vented .
All radioactive isotopes from the activated steam have gone ( decayed ) .
A very small amount of Cesium was released , as well as Iodine .
If you were sitting on top of the plants @’ chimney when they were venting , you should probably give up smoking to return to your former life expectancy .
The Cesium and Iodine isotopes were carried out to the sea and will never be seen again .
§ There was some limited damage to the first containment .
That means that some amounts of radioactive Cesium and Iodine will also be released into the cooling water , but no Uranium or other nasty stuff ( the Uranium oxide does not “@ dissolve @” in the water ) .
There are facilities for treating the cooling water inside the third containment .
The radioactive Cesium and Iodine will be removed there and eventually stored as radioactive waste in terminal storage .
§ The seawater used as cooling water will be activated to some degree .
Because the control rods are fully inserted , the Uranium chain reaction is not happening .
That means the “@ main @” nuclear reaction is not happening , thus not contributing to the activation .
The intermediate radioactive materials ( Cesium and Iodine ) are also almost gone at this stage , because the Uranium decay was stopped a long time ago .
This further reduces the activation .
The bottom line is that there will be some low level of activation of the seawater , which will also be removed by the treatment facilities .
§ The seawater will then be replaced over time with the “@ normal @” cooling water · § The reactor core will then be dismantled and transported to a processing facility , just like during a regular fuel change .
§ Fuel rods and the entire plant will be checked for potential damage .
This will take about 4 @-@ 5 years .
§ The safety systems on all Japanese plants will be upgraded to withstand a 9.0 earthquake and tsunami ( or worse )
See these posts for some detailed pictures and explanations .

Skwinty @...
sounds as if the reactor cores are being directly flooded with seawater .
Reactor cores are not generally flooded with coolant I assume .
Is this seawater being circulated somehow do you know ?
Thanks .
Only this afternoon there was an item about the fact that many ( petro @-@ chemical ) pollutants were washed over crop fields because of the debris carried by the tsunami .
Most forms of petro chemical polution of agricultural soils have a tendency to abate over time due to bio @-@ degradation .
It is even possible to remediate heavy metal polution through bio remidiation .
Although , it is likely that most of these feilds will need to be taken out of production for a while .
The power plant itself was the only real casualty .
I was listening to a harrowing account of an elderly women looking through the wreckage of her home for her husband 's medal ( he had died 100 days before ) and one of the journalist 's descriptions turned to the globules of tarry petrochemicals dripping from everywhere .
The local refinery had exploded before catching fire , how much damage is that type of pollution going to cause ?
Yes a nuclear reactor malfunctioning is very worrying - especially one so old - but I suspect that compared to the pollution caused by everything else as a result of the tsunami and earthquake it will be almost insignificant .
Ah , but it has the word "@ nuclear @" in it !!!
I made a blog post about this whole situation last night , for what it 's worth @:

Cheers - MM
Well written .
For the lurkers , since DC appears to be trollin @' away to the hills now @:
The problem at Fukushima is a serious one .
No one doubts that , and no one expects anyone to ignore it like it 's a small car crash .
Nuclear facilities going into meltdown is a big thing , and if the worst case scenario happens , will be a dangerous thing too .
However , as has been pointed out time and time again , meltdown does n't mean nuclear waste / fuel / radiation being pumped into the atmosphere .
Nuclear meltdown does n't mean the ground will be poisoned for decades .
Nuclear meltdown with intact and fairly stable containment means a big mess and a lot of expensive cleaning up .
If the containment was absent as it was in Chernobyl , yes , we would be seeing radiation entering the air at a fairly alarming rate , and if the containment is destroyed we might also see some smallscale but highly dangerous leakage .
As it happens though , at worst one reactor containment area has been mildly damaged .
This sounds alarming as hell , but all it means is a small amount of radiation is being leaked .
So far this has peaked at a level that is not dangerous for small scale exposure , but prolonged and continuous exposure could well be harmful .
However , it is notable that this peak was short lived , as far as I am aware , although if anyone wants to contradict me , show your sources .
All this means is that in order to be in any danger whatsoever , you would have to stand in the affected area ( between two reactors mark you , so not somewhere John Q Public is likely to be ) for a prolonged time without a protective suit .
Further to this , as it stands the radiation levels are dropping and plant cooling is occurring .
A couple of the reactors have already gone into cold shut @-@ down , meaning that they are now safe , and only one other reactor , Fukushima reactor 2 , is still being cooled .
This procedure seems to be going as smoothly as it can given the devastation wrought upon the area by the natural disasters that occurred .
The same can not be said for the petrochemical plants in the area .
That is not the way I udnerstand what is happening .
The current issue now is not so much the reactors themselves , which are still at risk , but the spent fuel pools .
The last explosion was caused by one of those pools in a reactor building where the reactor was not even in operation .
They do n't even know the status of the pools at reactor 's 1 and 2 .
Those pools are NOT in containment like the reactors are .
I think they 're talking about Fukushima Daini , not Fukushima Daiichi .
Damn , All their words look alike to me .
Ah , damn .
Not so good then .
Still good news .
That is diffusion , not decay .
{ / semantic nit pick }
It 's both due to half @-@ life being so short .
Some of the gases have half @-@ lives in the minutes , some in the hours .
So dose drops quickly .
About the 400 mSv/hr figure @:
The JAIF reports 400 mSv "@ beside Unit 3 @" and about 500 μSv/hr at the NPS ( I assume nuclear power station ) border .
<a href="http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1300189582P.pdf"> http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_i...300189582P.pdf </a>
On the other hand , they quote the "@ chief cabinet secretary @" as saying "@ 400 mSv/hr in the vicinity of unit @-@ 3 @"
<a href="http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1300191989P.pdf"> http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_i...300191989P.pdf </a>
I 'm not sure , but my guess is that the cabinet secretary misquoted the numbers .
That could well be .
The media here is confusing milli @- and microsieverts all the time ; it 's not fear @-@ mongering ( the errors go both ways ) , it 's just scientific illiteracy plain and simple .
well i am not so sure if i would want to be living death sick or rather death .
An in-depth IAEA study , described as a "@ three @-@ volume , 600 @-@ page report and incorporating the work of hundreds of scientists , economists and health experts , assesses the 20 @-@ year impact of the largest nuclear accident in history @" had this to say about the health effects on humans @:
Approximately 1 000 on-site reactor staff and emergency workers were heavily exposed to high @-@ level radiation on the first day of the accident ; among the more than 200,000 emergency and recovery operation workers exposed during the period from 1986 @-@ 1987 , an estimated 2,200 radiation @-@ caused deaths can be expected during their lifetime .
An estimated five million people currently live in areas of Belarus , Russia and Ukraine that are contaminated with radionuclides due to the accident ; about 100,000 of them live in areas classified in the past by government authorities as areas of "@ strict control @" .
The existing "@ zoning @" definitions need to be revisited and relaxed in light of the new findings .
About 4,000 cases of thyroid cancer , mainly in children and adolescents at the time of the accident , have resulted from the accident 's contamination and at least nine children died of thyroid cancer ; however the survival rate among such cancer victims , judging from experience in Belarus , has been almost 99 % .
Most emergency workers and people living in contaminated areas received relatively low whole body radiation doses , comparable to natural background levels .
As a consequence , no evidence or likelihood of decreased fertility among the affected population has been found , nor has there been any evidence of increases in congenital malformations that can be attributed to radiation exposure .
Poverty , "@ lifestyle @" diseases now rampant in the former Soviet Union and mental health problems pose a far greater threat to local communities than does radiation exposure .
Not quite the radiological disaster on human health as one might have thought given the seriousness of the accident .
Wow , it seems that we , and especially MattusMaximus , stepped massively onto Greg Laden 's toes .
He 's doing quite a bit of complaining <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/03/the_fukushima_disaster_hyperbo.php?utm_source=networkbanner&utm_medium=link"> here </a> .
Greetings ,
Chris
Who is Greg Laden and why should anyone care ?
Those hydrogen explosions that have been on the news and TEPCO admitting that the core water level in the three reactors are half full , recovering from dried and half full , indicate to me that this is a full on complete meltdown in all three reactors .
In two of those they are admitting that there is fuel damage and they are venting the containment , which means that we have a continuing uncontrolled release of fission products to the atmosphere .
There are very brief moments in my life when I wish that the internet was just turned off - reading your post was one of them .
Edit @: And yeah , thanks to such people the spent fuel has to be stored on-site , usually on or above ground level , instead of being burried in a mountain or somewhere .
Makes it sooooo much safer .
Not .
Who 's spinning rubbish now ?
"@ Such people @" have got absolutely nothing to do with why the Japanese keep spent fuel on-site .
Correct me if I 'm wrong .
Well turn off your computer and turn on the tv , can we agree it 's a 6 now ?
I 'm ashamed of being German these days .
German politians are claiming that this will bring the end of nuclear power worldwide .
Yeah , it is pretty scary to see so many German buying into hysteric woo .
Bad historicall precedent .
Very Bad .
I 'm usually a champion of NPR as a news source but their reporting on this story ( at least on Morning Edition and All Things Considered ) has been appallingly bad , spreading all kinds of misinformation , though I do n't necessarily think its deliberate .
It 's just sloppy .
I 'm considering sending a nastygram to Richard Harris in particular , for his sky @-@ is @-@ falling reporting on M.E.
I think you can safely ignore what they say on the subject .
Anderson Cooper on CNN tonight was just as bad .
Also , this is how anti @-@ nuclear people work here in Germany @:
1 ) Complain about nuke power being somewhat subsidized , but never mention that renewable energy is highly subsidized
2 ) Complain that the operation of nukes costs so much money , but then go ahead making massive protests & demonstrations at , and tie themselves to , the train tracks of the Castor transports .
This causes extreme delays in the transport , requires way more police personnel then normally required for that longer time .
And last time , the managed to tie them to the tracks in such a way that workers had to actually cut these tracks apart and repair them afterwards .
3 ) Complain about the fact that there is no suitable terminal storage facility , but actively work against getting one built .
4 ) Complain about old , unsafe reactors , but force the government to ban companies from building new and safer ones .
At the same time this also causes the companies to keep the old ones running even longer , prolonging the risk .
For example , here in Germany , if you have a photo @-@ voltaic system running ( solar cells ) , the energy companies are forced to buy that electricity , and the PV owner gets about 43 Euro @-@ Cent per kilowatt @-@ hour .
Regular electricity costs "@ only @" about 13 or 14 Euro @-@ Cent per kWh . And in that price there is the added premium of 3 or 4 Cents per kWh included that results from the "@ Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz ( EEG ) @" , which means "@ renewable energies law @" .
This means that _@ everyone @_ has to pay a premium to keep that system alive .
I 'm absolutely sure that if those people who have contracts for getting only renewable energy instead of the regular energy mix , would have to pay the _@ full @_ price , they surely would be the first ones to scream "@ we want nukes ! @"
After all , that price would be at least 50 to 60 Cent per kWh , if the PV owners already get 43 Cent @....
And they have the balls to complain that nuclear energy is partially subsidized .
Hypocrisy at it 's finest , i tell you .
Let 's not forget that they also want to have electric cars everywhere instead of combustion engines .
But somehow they do n't spend a minute thinking about where that amount of electricity should come from .
Let alone the problems of manufacturing and disposing suitable batteries .
I simply fail to see how all that is supposed to work , and to be achieved , in the long run .
Without exception they all completely ignore the energy , material , production , build and space needed to switch to renewable energy completely .
For them , wind @-@ parks and solar @-@ panels seem to grow on trees , install themselves , hook themselves up to the grid , and need no space at all .
And of course these technologies are obviously able to produce electricity 24/7 , regardless of the fact that most of the day there is n't enough sun or wind .
But hey , I 'm happy to switch to renewable energy .
Bring me a bunch of anti @-@ nuke people and a bunch of stationary bicycles with fat dynamos , and I 'm sure i can manage to hook them to my distribution box .
Presto , renewable energy !
Greetings ,

Why is the Anti Nuke movement so much more powerful in Germany then it is in other European countries ?
Just curious .
The evacuation zone was precautionary .
So far , nothing has happened to require a complete survey before letting people return to their homes after the crisis is over .
Case in point if it is 300 micro Sv per hour at the plant outside perimeter , it can n't be that high 1 km , 5 km , or even 30 km away .
The explosions were from hydrogen gas generated when the reactor cores , and apparently in at least one case , a spent fuel rod pool , were partially uncovered by falling ( evaporating , maybe leaking ) water levels .
The steam was dissociated into its components hydrogen and oxygen .
This is not true .
The hydrogen comes from the zirc @-@ water reaction .
Zr + 2 H2O -> ZrO2 + 2 H2
If they kept the pumps running , then why did three reactor buildings blow up ?
Building that had fuel rods on top of the buildings ?
Why did they run out of power after 8 hours ?
That does n't make any sense at all .
And if something does n't make sense , it probably is n't true .
If you lost your power supply , and you know that if the pumps stop it is disaster , why would they not fly in power for pumps ?
Before they fail ?
This is wrong .
There is something wrong here .

If that is true , then the design of the back up system is terrible .
Hindsight is 20 / 20 , especially for armchair analysts .
Jerry Sandusky , former defensive coordinator of Penn State 's football team , has been indicted on multiple charges involving sexual contact with a minor ( you can find the indictment <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov/uploadedFiles/Press/Sandusky-Grand-Jury-Presentment.pdf"> here </a> , but be warned it is a VERY difficult read ) .
Over the course of over ten years , he used his charity for underprivileged children to meet potential new victims and established a pattern of abuse which has now been brought to light .
There is much to be discussed here , especially regarding the responsibilities of witnessing parties / athletic administration and the way the public will view the tragedy in the scope of "@ well , it 's awful , but how will it affect FOOTBALL ? @"
This is beyond disgusting , many people should be in prison over this .
Matt Millen broke down talking about it on ESPN .
I 'm not a legal expert , but I think failure to report is something that you can only get fined for , kind of a public shaming .
But I agree , there should at least be a house @-@ cleaning in the athletic department .
One thing that is interesting is the contradiction between what Joe Paterno has said in his public statements recently ( namely , that the GA gave him explicit details matching the testimony of what he witnessed ) and in his own testimony ( namely , that the GA had told him "@ something of a sexual nature @" had been witnessed ) .
Either he was really being vague on purpose in his testimony , he 's lying now , or he was lying on the stand .
All of this is just awful .
First of all , I 'm stealing that line .
Second , I was just taking a look at this animal 's wikipedia entry and found this @:
Should I be as disturbed by this as I am ?
This whole thing is disgusting .
It really makes you wonder not only how widespread it is , but also how widespread it could become .
I recently read about the custom of men in the Middle East keeping harems of boys , and how some of the boys interviewed said they could n't wait to become men so they could get their own harems of boys .
I had a job that required me to visit some charter schools in Oregon , out in the rural areas .
Something stood out to me -- all the teachers at the three schools I visited were men .
It struck me as odd , so I did an online search of teacher statistics and found that Oregon has a higher number of male teachers than the national average , by a significant amount ( this was a few years ago , so I can n't remember the exact statistic ) .
I know there is a well organized international network of pedophiles , with their own websites , etc. I started thinking , what if word got around about places ( like Thailand , for example ) where child sex was easy to get , or where so many members of the population were pedophile @-@ friendly , that no matter how high you went , you could not get anybody to take any action against them ?
Now comes Penn State with a pretty good example of how that can work .
I do n't know who blew the whistle on this one , but if Sandusky were a close friend of the governor or the president , we might never have found out .
If I were to witness a man anally raping a 10 @-@ year @-@ old , I 'm not walking away from that .
I 'm not leaving that child there .
And if @--@ IF @--@ it came down to violence to stop him , then that 's what it comes down to .
Make of it what you will , will n't hurt me none .
I 'm not trying to hurt anyone , but most would claim the same about joining the Nazis and persecuting Jews in WWII Germany .
electrocuting people as part of an experiment , etc. Meanwhile we know demonstrably that most of the time this is not the case .
Fine ; a whole bunch of apathetic individuals came across this .
Highly doubtful , and not in relation to any of the psychology topics I mentioned .
nothing seems to have changed .
Whether the inaction was the result of people just not particularly caring , or choosing their friend 's safety over the rape victims @' , or being absolutely evil @...
it makes no difference to the outcome , any more than does the fact that , after all , Sandusky did run a charity for children .
They chose to do nothing , and because of that more abuse took place - both directly ( in the case of the little boy Sandusky was allowed to finish raping after being walked in on ) and indirectly ( in the case of other children Sandusky had access to who were abused because nobody reported Sandusky ) .
All their current finger @-@ pointing and buck @-@ passing and shouts of "@ it was n't my responsibility @" that we 're currently witnessing is nothing but a QED of exactly the attitude that facilitated Sandusky 's abuses .
Obviously it will n't change anything in this case , but understanding why this happened again and again could help lead to policies preventing such lapses .
Or it could help us better correct for such perverse influences our own moral thinking .
And in the case of blame I think proclaiming guilt on a person affects both individuals , so it is best to be most accurate .
The discussion has n't been about the issue ; it 's been about what a bad guy the graduate assistant was .
According to the indictment , the graduate assistant was "@ distraught @" and "@ upset @" by what he saw .
Basically he was a victim of Sandusky , too .
The transgressions listed in the indictment began in 1994 , and there were many opportunities along the way for other people to stop Sandusky before he raped the boy in the locker room 2002 , including an actual police report in 1998 .
If responsible people had done their jobs , the GA would not have been put in a position he had no training for .
It 's definitely a fascinating phenomenon .
The GA , as an employee of the school and part of its culture , somehow "@ got @" that going directly to the police might not work out for the best .
Could he believe his eyes ?
Would he embarrass the boy ?
Would the police believe him over a professor emeritus ( which Sandusky is ) ?
I am sure many questions ran through his head while he was trying to deal with what he had seen , or thought he had seen .
And what about all the other people who "@ knew , @" but did n't want to know ?
Sandusky 's wife , the boys @' parents , Schultz , Curley , Paterno , the police detectives who interviewed Sandusky in 1998 and got him to promise never to do it again ?
So much goes into enabling pedophiles , especially when they are respected members of the communities .
The victims themselves do n't even know what 's going on when it is happening to them ; they do n't even know they have rights .
Until recent times , pedophilia has not been , in our culture , a simple question of right vs. wrong or black vs. white .
A lot of it has been about protecting the "@ dignity @" of the predator .
I agree , except for the beginning bit as being stated too strongly .
While many seem content with the "@ kick the pedo 's *** @" motto and no one has said they would do the same as these individuals , it is remarkable how many individuals independently "@ knew @" .
Thanks for picking me , ALB .
I 'll try not to let down the side .
What I actually said , both times , was that I would get that child out of that place .
The order of events and their priority are really important , you see .
The child 's safety is my prime objective .
I mention violence to the perpetrator as a secondary possibility that I 'd take on only if necessary to secure my primary objective .
If I could get the child out of there without touching the perp in any way , I 'd certainly rather do that .
I did n't mean to misquote you , I apologize .
How do I know I 'd react this way ?
I 've two reasons @:
1 . Having survived serial sexual abuse , I know first @-@ hand what that child 's experiencing ( as I rather expect a certain number of the rest of us might be able to say , true ? )
And my first instinct today would be to immediately secure that child 's safety .
From a purely personal point of view that not everyone can share with me , I do know my instincts .
2 . I know I 'd do it , because I 've done it before .
What other people 's reasons are for saying the same thing I 've said , I could n't tell you .
I know only what I would do , I know exactly why I 'd do it , and I know I 'm certain of it .
In that case , you most certainly do know what you would do , and I 'm deeply and truly sorry you experienced such an awful thing firsthand .
So what 's the argument here ?
That I 'm wrong to state absolutely that I know I would have reacted differently ?
Because I 've re @-@ read my two initial posts on the subject , and nowhere in there did I talk about anyone 's reactions but my own .
Now I realizes this means I 'm also criticizing McQueary 's actions by implication .
So are you .
So is everyone else .
No one here is excusing him .
The problem seems to be only that a few of us are claiming to know what we 'd do in the same circumstances .
Why this is a problem for anyone , I can not fathom , any more than I can fathom simply walking away and leaving that child to be raped .
I will n't be discussing it any further .
I see no point to it .
My own point was simply to express my utter incredulity that anyone , ANYONE , could simply walk away from a child being anally raped , right before his eyes .
I 've expressed that .
If anyone else has anything to say about it , fap away .
I do n't have a problem with you saying that , and I do n't think you 're wrong .
I am sorry it seemed that way .
I think that since this is such an emotionally @-@ charged topic , in particular for someone who went through sexual abuse , that it is easy for things to be misconstrued .
I find it difficult to imagine anyone , in particular myself , responding the way MacQueary did .
I do n't feel a need to continue that particular line of discussion , myself , as I do n't really see it going anywhere productive and I do n't want to drive away intelligent participants from the conversation .
I sincerely apologize if it seemed as if I were criticizing you or saying you were wrong , as nothing could be farther from the truth .
It 's fine , really .
I 'm not angry , especially not with you , and I would really hate it if you came away from this thinking I were angry .
I assure you sincerely , that is n't the case at all .
Your points are well @-@ taken .
But I could counter them , and did , and that 's all .
No harm , buddy , and surely no foul , to use a likely inappropriate sport metaphor .
I think if there 's one thing we can learn from this whole thing , it 's that absolutes are never correct
Right - a false dichotomy I was responding to in posts in this thread .
In essence , McQueary goes all Braveheart on Sandusky or he 's a complicit monster .
It seems to me that a 3 rd option of "@ he should have at least called the police @" is also being advocated here .
Thus , how 's about we put off the "@ string him up @" talk until we know what the heck we 're dealing with ?
Some of us do n't want to wait years or decades to have a discussion on "@ current @" events .
Waiting until we know what really happened usually requires , at a minimum , that the investigations , trials , and appeals be concluded .
And usually , even then , we will n't know the full story .
It 's OK to form opinions and discuss them in the meantime .
I trust most of this people on this site to modify their opinions accordingly as new information comes in .
Oh , yeah , absolutely !

In need of immediate intervention ?
That is not so black and white .
Were this a boy and an adult woman with her hands on the wall , would everyone be as visceral in their reactions ?
Would everyone feel it needed to be stopped immediately ?
<snip>
An adult having sex with a minor is legally rape .
A man having sex with a minor is taking .
A woman having sex with a minor boy is taking by giving , providing satisfaction .
I think this is a good point .
Children are devalued in most western cultures .
We all learn at home and in school that adults are to be given the benefit of the doubt , while children are not .
Most of us are prepared to discipline children at the drop of a hat , but there are a lot more cultural rules to be followed when confronting other adults .
You seem to have missed his point .
You know , not that I 'm excusing it in any way , but I can understand the Catholic apologetics like Donahue in the wake of the RCC scandal , because the RCC is founded on religious beliefs .
People are afraid of the word of the Church Jesus or God being undermined , so they rush in with the support of people who failed to act as an attempt to preserve their faith .
I may think it 's terrible , but at least I can wrap my brain around their mentality .
But football ?
People let this continue for years , and now fans are showing outpourings of support towards Paterno , because of football ?
I really agree with this .
Here is an article that expands @:
It ’s connected to the Bowl Championship Series , “@ conference realignment @” and all the ways in which college football has morphed over the last generation into a multibillion @-@ dollar big business .
This is n’t about Sandusky .
This is about about a culture that says the football team must be defended at all costs @: a culture where the sexual assault of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old is reported to Paterno before the police .
This is what happens when a football program becomes the economic and spiritual heartbeat of an entire section of a state .
The Nittany Lions football regularly draws 100,000 fans to Happy Valley .
They also produce $ 50 million in pure profit for the University every year and has been listed as the most valuable team in the Big 10 conference .
Another economic report held that every Penn State game pumps $ 59 million into the local economy @: from hotels to kids selling homemade cookies by the side of the road .
It ’s no wonder that Paterno is revered .
He took a football team and turned it into an economic life raft for a university and a region .
When something becomes that valuable , a certain mindset kicks in . Protect the team above all over concerns .
Protect Joe Pa.
Protect Nittany Lions football .
Protect the brand .
In a company town , your first responsibility is to protect the company .

Also @:
The love was evident as several hundred students crowded around Paterno 's house , located just a couple of blocks from campus .
Chants of "@ We are Penn State ! @"
and "@ Joe Paterno ! @"
filled an otherwise quiet , darkened street .
<a href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/7210030/penn-state-nittany-lions-coach-joe-paterno-receives-students-support"> Linky . </a>
And note that Sandusky "@ retired @" right after that incident , in the prime of his career when he was a shoo @-@ in to get a head coaching job .
Speculation today is the retirement was forced because PSU knew he was a child molester , yet they allowed him to use their facilities for his football camp for troubled children .
There was a scandal at Notre Dame last year that created a lot of furor locally ( I do n't think it got much national news attention ) where an unidentified athlete was accused of sexually assaulting a freshman girl .
The university waited 2 weeks before contacting the South Bend police , by which time the alleged victim had committed suicide .
That actually looks well @-@ handled in comparison to the PSU scandal .
Well @-@ handled ?
To revisit this @: I think you 're off your rocker .
I can n't conceive of a single instance of an adult "@ having anal sex with @" a ten @-@ year @-@ old that would not qualify as an assault , nor can I imagine what makes you think that there 's any kind of circumstance which would render such a rape not in need of immediate intervention if such is possible .
In retrospect , this is one of the most abhorrent posts I 've ever had the pleasure of reading on this forum .
It seems to me that people up and down the chain of command have violated the Cleary Act .
Every time someone on my campus is mugged , rather a lot , now I that I think about it , the campus police release a report of the incident and highlight the cleary act in the subject line .
This full disclosure is federal law , and if it was not acted on at Penn State , well , yikes .
The Chronicle of Higher Ed reports that the Education Dept. is now investigating .
Well @-@ handled ?
By comparison .
The furor over ND was that they waited 2 weeks to notify the police ( or properly counsel the victim ) , while PSU never did .
Were it not for the 2009 complaint that brought on the Grand Jury investigation I doubt they 'd ever have said anything .
this is a ridiculous comparison , and I have to wonder why you would go to such lengths to make excuses for the guy .
I would not .
I find it interesting that people keep assuming this because I point , as others have , to the social sciences for understanding these actions .
It is disappointing because I really wanted people to focus on the facts and not my personal opinion on it all ( more on that later ) .
First off , the people in Nazi Germany had been brainwashed for decades , with Nazi propaganda promoted to kids from the cradel .
Kids were even told to inform on their parents if they started telling them anti @-@ Nazi ideology , so you had a situation where parents saw their own children being bred into Nazis by the state but felt powerless to try and stop it .
Second of all , not collaberating with the Nazis had enormous repreccusions .
You or your sons could be sent to the Russian front .
You could end up in a concentration camp , or prison , or summarily executed .
You could lose your job at a time and place where starvation was rampant , and your family could die if you lost your job .
That was absolutely nothing like what this guy faced .
He was not brought up in a culture where child rape is acceptable .
He was not risking his life to help the child .
the very worst thing that could have happened to him is that he would not be believed and he could loose a job .
And this is n't winter in Nazi Germany in 1941 .
Losing your job does not have the same consequences .
Wah , sorry , I must have written that unclearly .
I was trying to argue against a famed moral dilemma that has people in their armchairs pontificating that they would never turn in Jews , etc. You are exactly right about the influences at play that lead to normal people behaving in such an abnormal manner .
And the reason people are focussing so much on the GA is with the actual perpetrator , well he 's clearly just an evil person .
Evil people do evil things and what else can you say about it ?
But by his own admission , the GA was very distraught over what he saw .
He knew he saw something horrible .
He was n't some low life sociopath or masochist .
That makes him failing to act much , much worse .
He was exactly the kind of person who could and should have interceeded .
Agreed .
This idea about "@ not comprehending what he was seeing @" or "@ thinking he was hallucinating @" really is a ridiculous stretch , and I do n't see how someone could go to such lengths to excuse him .
To that extent , yes .
And the fact that his father is saying that "@ he did exactly what he was supposed to @" and making it seem like the GA is himself a victim in all of this - Mary stating that he is a victim in all this , is simply disgusting .
This guy was not a victim .
Seeing something difficult does not make you a victim .
This guy was not some 12 year old kid , he was a grown man who could have intervened , and did not .
He was a coward , and there is no excuse for him .
Calling him a victim , Mary , is simply beyond terrible .
That child was a victim of both his rapist , and the man who saw him and did nothing .
The child was his victim , this guy was a victim of nothing but his own cowardice and moral failings .
I agree .
My problem has n't been with any of this , but the way people have been acting like his failing was some unthinkably extreme character deficiency .
My real position is that human nature is horrible , from our rational moral principle perspective .
This man 's character is no more scummy than one 's neighbour , who honestly is probably sitting on a similar story about Uncle Joe .
And by "@ no more @" I mean just as scummy , just under the right bizarre influences .
When I was having sex at eight , people "@ knew @" .
It is an age old story because human nature does n't change .
So people can leap onto their high horses and espouse moral dictums , but I will be skeptical .
[ snip ] @...
I 'm sorry that you were abused , but I disagree with your viewpoint .
I believe it 's our tendency to make excuses , to forgive those not upholding our morals , avoiding accountability , and lauding the protectionism of authority that create this tendency towards inaction .
We have to reward the good and point out the bad @: hold them up in the light and declare this is who we really are .
Reports of JoePa getting a lawyer has sparked a slew of rumors about what he knew / did .
It 's the way he coached and ran that team as a family .
Very few programs achieve that level of big-time football success with such a high level of academic success .
Skip class ?
You 're benched .
Fail a class ?
Benched , or off the team .
Want your name on your jersey ?
Go somewhere else ; we 're a team .
The whole "@ We are Penn State @" thing came from an incident in which the team was set to play in the segregated South and one or more of their African American players were taking heat .
The team 's response was that all of them , black and white , were integral to that team identity .
It was a gutsy show of solidarity against institutionalized racism .
Through the years , Joe could 've made tons more money .
He could 've recruited better athletes and won more championships .
But he had a love of that community - to which he 's donated millions - and a dedication to honor first , and winning second .
That 's why it 's so painful now to learn that in this critical instance Joe 's moral compass sent him to the Bermuda Triangle .
He really is a superb human being , but in this case he flat out failed to live up to anything near his own code of honor .
That 's the tragic irony and the cognitive dissonance here .
Well said , thanks .
He is certainly not faultless here and he knows and has said as much ; his punishment is far more than a sad ending to an unmatched and otherwise extremely honorable career .
It 's living with knowing he could have done more .
I would examine the evidence available and then make my mind up .
If I thought a member of my family or circle of friends had responded as was described in the Grand Jury paper I would be more angry than I would on learning of a similar set of circumstances involving a work colleague .
Good idea , although I 'm betting initially you would assume innocence and need one heckuva a case and a LOT of evidence to be swayed otherwise .
And there is little evidence in this right now .
There are accusations and testimonials only .
Strong stuff but IMO not nearly enough to *@ BANG @* stop or I 'll shoot .
I just think it would have been nice / advisable to have this go to court and KNOW what 's what before people started throwing molotov cocktails every which way .
He has been in a position of knowing he could have done more for the last ( around ) 10 years so I do n't see why it should now start being a punishment ?
I 'm not sure , but to me a superb human being might be moved to get off his ass and go investigate when it 's reported that one of his staff
Sandusky was not one of this staff .
oops , sorry , I threw another fact in there .
I keep forgetting they do n't matter in this issue .
An irrelevant fact .
snip @...
snip @...
That 's the point I was making earlier when I said I could understand why he did not take immediate action when he saw the child being raped and I accept that is how humans can react in such stressful circumstances .
But that only covers the immediate reaction , from what others have posted it seems that for years after witnessing the child being raped he would have seen the rapist with young children .
Given that I do think it is right to conclude that to not have taken further action over that timespan is a character flaw .
Wow .
What caliber weapons do you folks carry ?
On the internet , everone is Bruce Lee with an uzi .
It is soooo easy to sit here all comfy behind a computer with the luxury of hindsight and chit chatter away about I woulda done the exact right thing at the exact right time blah blah blah .
But when something this shocking blindsides you in an instant , FYI it might not be so easy / simple and being human you might not take the best path .
I do not excuse anyone in this situation who did n't , btw . Just something to think about .
This reminds me of a situation that happened to me a while ago that shows the apathy of even the police .
( warning , read completely , for my sake , lol . )
It was new years and me and some friends were at the bar , a female made her way over and started to hit on the lot of us ( 3 gents in total . )
, one friend was not into anything of that nature , but me and the other were good to go .
Now she was drunk , but no more than us , ( or so we thought ) and she was rather up front about what she was looking for .
It was snowy , terrible , and none of us had coats ( and i found my cab money has disapeared . )
So we started a rather long walk across town .
Now half way there she starts acting very erratic , getting intensely angry , not being able to stand , then getting really happy ( also unable to stand . )
, keep in mind it was around 2 am , so frequently we were telling her to not yell so loud , etc.
Now , i inquired and found out that she did large doeses of prescription drugs , and they had just started to kick in . So the plan changed from what it was , to getting her somewhere so she did n't wander off in the snow and die .
Now , while i know we were doing good , think of what this would look like to onlookers .
3 gents , seemingly dragging a very inebriated girl around saying things to the nature of " Just shut up @" ( in relation to her loud screaming of odd , or vulgar things . )
I personally thought we would get stopped at some point and have a long awkward explination .
But not so much , people looked , some people almost came over , but no one did anything .
Even when we walked by a female cop , and she jokingly said , loudly something about being kidnapped .
The cop was about to come over , but decided against it .
I just do n't get it , if the people were wrong , it would just have been a laugh , nothing big except for some wasted time , and awkwardness .
But what if we were planning something bad and taking her against her will ?
( which , it really would have seemed . )
Sometimes i just do n't get people .
( as a post script , upon getting back to my friends place , she proceeded to puke violently , and then , of all things , still try and push for the threeway .
Seeing as she was completely out of her mind , though very energetic , i spent a couple of hours convincing her it was a bad idea , and that , at least , she should wait to sober up a bit to make that decision .
Thankfully that pissed her , off and she ended up getting a safe way home with our third buddy . )
hmmm , you know , this would actually be a problem for me .
I live bordered by Boston College on one side of my neighborhood and Boston University and the other , on the main street , and in a bar heavy neighborhood .
And just in general , I live in Boston , which is filled with college students , Irish , and Italians .
If I stopped a group of people everytime I saw some guys dragging around a drunk girl shouting vulgarities , that 's all I 'd be doing every Friday and Saturday night .
You do n't seem to have read the grand jury paper - in that he stated that he was informed of ( at least ) a matter of inappropriate sexual activity .
I condemn him based on his own testimony .
He has had years in which to take action - he choose not to .
As I understand , he was on the staff when the first incident happened .
BTW I 'm amused by this part , because I do n't have the impression that you 're fact @-@ oriented .
Just the opposite actually .
Oh , those poor kids men .
So shocked and disoriented by what was seen and reported that they could hardly get it together to plan their 81 football games between the incident and last weekend .
I just feel horrible for them .
What is this world coming to ?
Will n't somebody think of the children football coaches ?
Could n't have possibly put it better than this .
This actually seems to be the prevailing attitude at a few Penn State message boards I 've lurked at .
That not one person who approves of Joe 's firing is anything more than jealous of his success or is just reveling at seeing an icon fall .
In fact , I 've seen multiple cases of people saying things like "@ We will rise above this @" and genuinely portraying this entire scandal as a concentrated attack against for Penn State .
Everyone 's just jealous of how awesome they are , and will stop at nothing !
There are a fair amount of people arguing - seriously - that most of the anger about the case is about people not being Penn State fans .
There is a lot of claims that this is nothing more but some giant conspiracy between the media and anti Penn Staters to bring them down .
There are many people acting like this entire scandal is about nothing more than malicious efforts to bring down Penn State because of how awesome they are .
They are painting themselves ( school , faculty , and fans ) as the real victims in all this .
The big argument they are using is that Joe and McQueary both reported the incident to their superiors , and that going to the police would have been wrong because they would be undermining their superiors .
They are literally saying that going above one 's superiors is worse than going to the police once one 's superiors take action .
What gets me is that there are people not just excusing Paterno and McQueary 's actions as understandable human foibles , but are actually praising them .
I have seen large numbers of Penn State cheerleaders saying that it is wisdom and maturity to not go to the police but instead count on one 's superiors to handle things directly and defer to their determinations ( such as not pressing charges or going to the police ) .
While they all seem to agree that the superiors are at fault for not reporting it , Paterno and McQueary are to be commended simply for reporting it and then doing the "@ appropriate @" thing by not undermining their superior 's decision .
And I 've seen variants of this line about a million times by now @:
"@ I really feel sorry for people with such hate in their hearts that they feel the need to go after Papa Joe after ( list professional accomplishments of Paterno ) .
Paterno did what he was supposed to , and still has said that he is sorry he did n't do more .
As a Christian , I pity all these hateful critics and I will pray for them . @"
Also , Penn State fans are being encouraged to wear white to the next game in order to protest the persecution of Paterno and express their support .
Wow , this is pretty appalling .
Fanboys will always be fanboys , but for a pedophile @-@ enabler ?
Unbelievable .
And it 's not like he 's even going to jail , he just got fired .
Boo ******* hoo .
Please keep in mind swearing must be completely masked in the public sections of the forum .
Posted By @:@ Lisa Simpson
"@ Did what he was supposed to do @" @...
wow , I hope these tards are never witness to any kind of crime or assault on my person , because I know I could never count on them for help .
I just do n't get this .
McQueary tells JoePa that he saw "@ something inappropriate of sexual nature @" between Sandusky and a 10 year old kid .
And Paterno says , "@ Ok , thank you for that , have a nice day @" and tells the AD ?
That does n't make any sense .
He does n't say , "@ What do you mean , "@ inappropriate @" ?
What exactly did you see ? @"
This was an act supposedly by his best buddy , happening right in his lockerrooms , and he does n't ask for ANY details to find out precisely what the guy was talking about ?
I said it before , this was Paterno 's football program , and he is responsible for stuff going on within it .
He can n't pass the buck and say , "@ Do n't look at me , I told my boss . @"
But no , he acts as if he got a memo from the McQueary and forwarded it on to his superiors like he was supposed to .
It just does n't make sense .
If that is what he did , he totally ignored the severity of the accusation , if not legally , but absolutely in terms of the impact it could have on his football program .
Yeah , the more I think about it , the more I believe that not only did Paterno fail miserably at handling the case , but he was possibly completely aware of what was going but was just protecting his buddy .
I can n't prove this , obviously , but when you gather all the facts , it paints a likelier story , IMO .
Anyway , he 's either a completely incompetent coward , or a lowlife scumbag protecting his child @-@ raping friend .
You are probably not told even once what to do if you see a man raping a child in the shower .
Because there are some things you do n't need to be told since they are so bleeding obvious ?
He did n't look away and he did have empathy for the victim .
28 years old sounds old but it is n't .
That he was a graduate assistant suggests he had been in school basically his whole life .
Students , employees and young people in general learn to defer serious problems to their superiors , whose jobs are to resolve them .
Mike McQueary is an interesting case in that he was practically raised to be a part of the Penn State family .
Son of prominent local businessman , star quarterback for the local schools , eventually Penn State quarterback .
If there was ever someone destined to spend their life on the sidelines with Paterno , it was him .
Actually , he told his father , who told him to tell Paterno , THEN he told Paterno the next day .
Who waited a day before telling his boss , who waited a week before telling his boss , who did n't do anything of merit apart from taking the keys to the locker room away from Sandusky .
edit @: Also , the GA did n't just witness a child being molested .
It really needs to be stated that what the GA saw happening was full anal intercourse with a ten @-@ year @-@ old boy .
The fact that it was then euphemized as "@ some horseplay in the showers @" by administration officials is something that really outrages me .
I did n't know it was that bad .
According to McQueary that is exactly what did happen - have you not read the indictment ?
I did n't read it .
Did the kid say anything ?
Did McQueary have eye contact ?
If so and McQueary walked out , he should be fired as well .
I think you mean "@ Paterno @" .
At any rate , according to the GJ report the boy and McQueary did make eye contact when he saw the boy being raped .
Yes , my bad .
Gawd knows why I do n't catch those typos , I try to re @-@ read posts after I post them but I still seem to make lots of errors .
The kid has never been identified , so we only have McQueary 's word for it .
And McQueary says that both the child and Sandusky made eye contact , and saw he was there .
The Grand Jury testimony is located <a href="http://www.freep.com/assets/freep/pdf/C4181508116.PDF"> here </a> if anyone needs the link .
Read the testimony .
Very little is left to the imagination @...
and there is precious little room for interpretation .
McQueary said Sandusky and the kid saw him but he did n't say there was eye contact .
I mean , saying they saw him could mean eye contact or it could mean no eye contact .
Just clarifying , in case it matters .
I think it is likely there will be some fakers @...
actually very likely @...

Most research so far has refereed pedophilia as a '@ paraphilia @' , which essentially means getting off on sick and abnormal things and situations .
I 've read that some professionals have called pedophilia a sexual orientation because , just like '@ homosexuality @' and '@ heterosexuality @' , it is usually stable and is formed early in the sexual development .
Notwithstanding whether calling pedophilia a sexual orientation is in anyway good and informative , this naturally causes all kinds of controversy because it includes such freakish monsters with "@ normal people @" and how it supposedly '@ normalizes @' pedophilia and child @-@ molesters .
A common theme is that people started to make homosexuality acceptable then later it will be pedophilia and then it will be @...
the end of society ?
<snip>
So pedophilia is not considered a result of a developmental disruption ( like rape or molestation as a child ) and therefore preventable ?
I was so hoping @...
I assumed that was what happened to Michael Jackson .
I have n't read every post , but I have n't heard about any of his victims actually coming forward @..
Have they ?
One article I read said the average pedophile has over 200 victims in a lifetime .
I do n't know about paedophilia generally , but wrt pederasty in particular I read one article somewhere that said it was caused by an extreme form of sexual narcissism .
Its basically love of an idealised , younger version of the molester 's self .
So I suppose it would be caused by similar things to those which cause Narcissistic Personality Disorder .
I 'm not sure though , I 'd have to look the article up .
They must be considering children in images and videos the pedophile looked at in order to arrive at 200 .
That can n't be the number they physically touched @....
if that 's what you read there is no way that is true .
You know how you read something , and a half @-@ formed thought comes immediately to mind ?
My half @-@ formed thought was @...
has it then been incorrect all this time that some victims become abusers ?
Does that then never happen ?
I 've heard that it does , all my life it seems .
But if pedophilia is an orientation , like homosexual or heterosexual or bisexual @...
then victims do n't "@ become , @" do they ? @...
or do they ?
Or what ?
Repeating a question before answering it is thought to be an indicator of deception , according to this @:

I have encountered this notion before .
I know it 's a delaying tactic , but I would think even an honest person might use it , if they know the answer is n't exactly going to make them or the situation look good .
If they need time to make sure they answer with the truth , but in a way that will n't be misperceived .
It could go either way , I suppose , and it 's probably more important to also be looking for the other indicators in that list , as well .

Skeptical Greg ,
The Knox / Sollecito case is a helpful reminder of the benefits of ignoring the chaff that is put out right after an arrest .
I can understand why people would have thought Knox and Sollecito guilty if they listened to the statements made by police and prosecutors , many of which were false .
Ditto with respect to the three defendants in the Duke lacrosse case .
Innocent until proven guilty is not just a good idea ; it 's the law .
Yet this standard does n't mean much if the jurors have already made up their minds .
Nor does it serve any purpose for the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/13/usa-crime-coach-governor-idUSN1E7AC05920111113"> Governor of Pennsylvania </a> to weigh in on McQueary 's moral obligations , although at least he has not been indicted ( in which case the Governor should keep completely quiet ) .
You are correct that innocent until proven guilty would still apply even if we had a video tape of the alleged rape in the DL case or the sexual assault / murder in the Knox / Sollecito case .
Fortunately the alleged acts in each of these two cases flew in the face of the laws of physics and physiology .
MOO .
Not when the man publicly states he enjoys horsing around with young boys in the shower .
There 's not a glimmer of a resemblance to sex killer Knox or liar what 's @-@ her @-@ face at Duke .
Why do you suppose the Gov went on public record ?
He 's one of the trustees who is absolutely responsible for the mess at Penn State .
He gets to cover his ass ( probably a well @-@ advised move here ) while placing all the responsibility on the Penn State administration .
By Sandusky 's own admission , this stuff has been going on for years although he '@ defends @' himself by downplaying the blatant sexual assault aspect of his behaviour .
I do n't know if Paterno and Sandusky were close at one point but I get the impression that by the time Sandusky left Penn State they were on the outs .
Sandusky had the 1998 incident and according to the GJ report not too long after that one of the victims said Paterno told him he would n't be the next head coach of PSU and Sandusky was upset about it .
And then one year later he retired .
I 've read that at Sandusky 's retirement party Paterno made only a brief appearance and said only a few words whereas if they were close at that point you 'd think Paterno would do and say a lot more at Sandusky 's going away party .
I do n't know if Paterno ever said anything to Sandusky about his behavior but he must have known at least about the 1998 incident ( before 2002 happened I mean ) and maybe that 's what turned him cold to Sandusky , or maybe he was cold to him already .
I read an column the other day about a guy that was an assistant coach at PSU in the 1980 s and a victim of sexual abuse himself as a child and it was fairly scathing of PSU .
But anyway , the reason I bring it up is that he said that Sandusky used to tell him that he hated Paterno .
So who knows ?
Maybe it was a case of guys that did n't get along personally but who tolerated each other professionally because doing so helped the football program .
The potential cover @-@ up is as bad as the original series of crimes IMO .
That should n't just be swept under the rug while all the focus is on Sandusky and his behaviour .
I hope they have the equivalent of a Royal Commission to investigate just how far the information traveled about Sandusky .
It would also help to examine other programmes and root out this problem once and for all .
If Sandusky were the only athletic official to have ever faced such charges then I might not be so concerned but read up on the Theoren Fleury situation in hockey .
This is n't isolated ; it 's endemic .
slingblade ,
Very , according to Geiselman and Dr. Paul Ekman , In previous studies , Ekman found that without training , the average person 's abilty to identify a liar is roughly the same as chance . @"
Well , in this instance , it is n't very difficult for the average person to come to the conclusion that Sandusky is lying through his lying teeth .
It does n't even make any sense .
He says he stopped it @...
so where 's the kid ?
Well no , he did n't say he stopped it ; he said he "@ made sure it stopped @" which is much more unspecific and sounds like he 's setting up some kind of plausible deniability .
Especially if the "@ pimping out to boosters @" thing is true .
We have n't heard anything on that in a few days .
Why did n't he bring the kid to a hospital , or stay with the kid until the police arrived ?
Why did he just send Sandusky on his merry way if he was present enough to intervene and stop it ?
Also , I 've heard reports that McQueary continued to work on children 's charity events with Sandusky after he saw Sandusky raping that kid .
Let 's say he did perjur himself .
He did hollar or clock Sandusky and made sure he stopped raping the kid .
But then he just left the just raped kid by himself and went off to his dad , not following up with the police or a hospital ?
How did he know Sandusky did n't go right back and continue raping him ?
He also continued to watch Sandusky interact with kids knowing he was a child rapist .
Even this new whitewashed version of events does n't exactly reflect well on him .
Also , if he did lie to the grand jury , why would he tell that lie ?
There is NO motivation , no incentive , nothing to be gained , in telling the public that '@ truth @' but the grand jury that '@ lie @' .
It only makes rational and logical sense if he told the grand jury the truth , but is lying to the public .
They 've started the pushback against McQueary 's story @:
<a href="http://www.tmz.com/2011/11/15/jerry-sandusky-lawyer-mcqueary-liar/"> http://www.tmz.com/2011/11/15/jerry-...mcqueary-liar/ </a>
That is interesting that the lawyer says he "@ thinks he may have found the kid in question and he says it never happened @" .
Given how many kids Sandusky showered with , I wonder what makes him sure he 's talking to the right one .
In any case , it does n't much matter at the very end of the day .
The indictment has testimony from six other kids who are adamant that things happened to them , so @...
The potential cover @-@ up is as bad as the original series of crimes IMO @....
Really ?
In this case the original crimes were many magnitudes worse than the cover up IMO , and I frankly can not fathom anyone saying or thinking otherwise .
And certainly the cover up may have , and probably did allow for further incidents of abuse ; but only in this aspect did the cover up even approach a somewhat similar level of seriousness to the multiple incidents of child rape and molestation .
If the individual said it did not happen ( which is what <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/133872183.html"> Amendola </a> is suggesting ) , the the 2002 incident should no longer be in the indictment .
This might take McQueary out of the picture .
I think that William Anderson was correct to question why the 2002 incident was part of the indictment , for reasons already given .
If the cover up did in fact facilitate more molestations , I suppose one could argue that it 's all part of the same big predatory "@ event @" .
You do n't go to prison for lying to the public .
stilicho ,
The three cases have little in common .
However , KC Johnson , the premier blogger on the Duke lacrosse case , has some <a href="http://durhamwonderland.blogspot.com/2011/11/duke-penn-state.html"> interesting observations </a> on the present one @: "@ The university reappointed its president , and retained the same faculty hiring patterns that appeared to foster the rush @-@ to @-@ judgment attitude .

Oh and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/victim-penn-state-officials-rejected-claims-university-professor/story?id=14960575#.TsM_enLnPzs"> while we 're at it </a> :
McLaughlin said , after repressing the memories of his alleged abuse , that he decided to confront Neisworth over the phone in 2001 as part of his therapy .
He tape @-@ recorded the conversation , in which he claims that the professor admitted to performing oral sex on him .
"@ I was in the process of trying to get him to open up about some of the sexual acts and what not , and he actually interrupted me and says , '@ Do you remember driving up on the hill ?
'@ @" McLaughin said .
"@ I said , '@ Was n't that the first time you went down on me ?
' He said , '@ I do n't know if it was the first time but it was certainly fierce , @' was his words . @"
Over the course of a few months from the end of 2001 into early 2002 , McLaughlin said he sent his taped conversation with Neisworth to university officials , but each time he was "@ rejected . @"
"@ They did n't want copies of the tape recorded conversation .
They did n't want to hear it , period , @" he said .
"@ It was extremely emotional for me to have to make these calls to begin with , but then to be rejected the way I was and basically treated as if I had done something wrong in making those calls . @"
McLaughlin said he spoke with one Penn State official on the phone at the time who refused to even investigate his claim .
"@ They said do n't bother sending it we 're not interested in fabrications , stories , any attempts at extortion or blackmail .
I mean , they made it seem like I was looking for something for myself , @" McLaughlin said .
"@ I did n't ask them for money .
I did n't ask them for anything other than make sure they look into this .
Listen to the tape and get this guy away from children . @"
McLaughlin said he also spoke with former Penn State president Graham Spanier on the phone within two weeks of allegations being made about former defensive football coach Jerry Sandusky sexually abusing young boys .
Spanier and head football coach Joe Paterno were fired last week in the wake of the accusations , which were first reported on Nov. 5 . McLaughlin said he was met with the same "@ hostility @" that he had received from other university officials .
"@ [ Spanier ] told me that as far as he was concerned it was hearsay , '@ [ Neisworth ] has an impeccable record .
He has never been accused of anything , @' @" McLaughlin said .
"@ They were more interested in protecting the school .
They did n't seem to have any interest in protecting children at all . @"
Neisworth was later charged with multiple counts of child sexual abuse in Cecil County , Md. , in 2005 .
However , McLaughlin claimed that at the time , Penn State officials said an indictment was n't enough to investigate one of their faculty members .
I heard the Bob Costas interview .
OK , if you want to shower with kids , there is something wrong with your brain .

*@ head @-@ desk @*
Either this is coming completely out of your own head , or you 've got some kind of source that backs you up .
All I have is personal experience , and it does n't back you up at all .
I 'm only asking you show the evidence for your claim so I can evaluate it myself , as you seem to have done .
<snip>
I do n't really think I 'm saying anything controversial , or even anything you disagree with .
All I 'm saying is that when thousands of children were being molested in the '@ 60 's , the public did not respond to it the way they can and will today .
It 's my opinion that I fail to see how any adult could n't do all in his power and beyond it if possible to try to stop ongoing pedophilia of which he was aware .
I fail to see what he 's got to be confused about .
That he can somehow find some way to justify it to himself concerns me not in the least , nor does it garner my empathy or sympathy .
Describing a person 's possible motives or thinking does not imply empathy or sympathy .
I do n't approve of Joe Paterno 's failure to act .
They are relevant because they indicate that during the 1980 s , the culture took the issue very seriously .
The charges were nonsense , but they do not reduce the conclusion that the culture took the charges seriously .
In fact , it was quite the opposite .
The charges were taken so seriously because , even though the charges were nonsense , people were so outraged that they wanted to make them stick at any cost .
That event , therefore , gives the lie to @Mary_H 's claim .
Which is the point .
I would suggest that the '@ 80 's were when making a big deal out of sexual abuse finally became okay for some parts of the population .
Obviously , though , even the '@ 80 's were too soon for the population of Happy Valley .
And again , you have n't provided anything to back this up .
You have n't shown it was n't a code of silence as opposed to tacit acceptance .
You 've not done anything but make declarations of fact with no evidence whatsoever .
What is the difference between a code of silence and tacit acceptance ?
Do I really need evidence to establish that culture changes over fifty years ?
In trying to refute my own claim , I looked for evidence of public sexual abuse scandals before the '@ 80 's .
I have n't found anything yet , but I came across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_sex_abuse_cases"> this interesting information in Wikipedia </a> :
Germany
Third Reich 1933 @–@ 1945
During the Nazi era , false cases of sexual abuse were fabricated to malign the Catholic Church .
The "@ immorality trials @" ( Sittlichkeitsprozesse ) of Catholic priests in April and May 1937 are the prime examples of this phenomenon .
[ 40 ] In these trials , innocent priests and members of religious orders became the target of accusations of luring children and youth into sexual acts .
Staged trials of Franciscan friars held in 1936 did not receive the media attention the National Socialist regime hoped for ; and this was not the only problem .
In a case that would eventually be dismissed as baseless the alleged victim , when asked at trial if the offender was in the courtroom , pointed to the president of the court .
[ 41 ] Hence , in order to show that the "@ offences against morality @" were a massive problem within the Catholic Church , the regime ordered that individual cases should be accumulated at a more opportune moment .
A large number of cases were brought to trial in the spring of 1937 .
Stefan Micheler writes @:
Over the course of eight weeks between April and June , the daily and party newspapers and radio devoted extensive , front @-@ page coverage to the trials @...
The coverage focused on the seduction of children and youth , the exploitation of relationships of dependence , and the abuse of rank and office .
The press ignored cases where investigations were dropped or trials resulted in acquittals due to lack of evidence or ill @-@ founded accusations .
[ 42 ]
In a speech at Berlin 's Deutschlandhalle on May 30 , 1937 , Joseph Goebbels stated in front of 25,000 people that the "@ criminal aberrations of the Catholic clergy threaten the physical and moral health of our young people . @"
He declared that the "@ plague @" would be "@ radically extirpated . @"
The speech was spurred on by the crowd 's repeated cries of "@ Hang them !
Massacre them ! @"
[ 41 ] Florence Tamagne writes @: "@ The anti @-@ Catholic campaign continued until 1941 .
By 1936 , all the Catholic youth organizations had been closed down . @"
However , she also notes that , of approximately 20,000 German priests , "@ only 57 were convicted ; of 4,000 members of the regular clergy , only 7 were convicted .
Lastly , of 3,000 lay brothers , 170 were convicted , mostly Franciscans . @"
[ 41 ] According to reports published by SoPaDe , the propaganda nature of the trials was widely recognized by both Catholics and Protestants .
Nevertheless , as a result of the trials , children and youth would often avoid socializing with Catholic priests .
[ 42 ]
~~~ · Do I really need evidence to establish that culture changes over fifty years ?
That 's a given .
BUT .
You need to provide evidence that a specific aspect has changed .
My recollection is that it has n't , at least in regard to adults and actual children ( sub @-@ 15 year olds ) .
Emphasis mine - I did n't mean to imply that people in Paterno 's generation actually give a lot of conscious thought to the victims or consider why they are reluctant to talk about sexual abuse .
I can picture Paterno thinking "@ Geez , that poor kid @" when he first heard about this , and then never considering the victim again .
Yeah , although I readily admit I of course do n't know this to a certainty , that 's my best guess to how this went down as well as far as Paterno 's concerned .
There was n't overt acceptance of this kind of stuff before but I think there was a kind of implicit acceptance .
I grew up in the 70 s and it was n't so much that it was accepted but rather it just was n't an issue one way or the other .
The McMartin stuff , which was in the 80 s , was the first I can remember even hearing about or thinking of the notion of child sexual abuse .
As bad as these scandals are ( Catholic Church , PSU ) I think in the long run they do broader good in the sense that they make the next scandal less likely to happen and they make people less likely to remain quiet when they hear something or something happens to them .
I think PSU was the perfect storm .
There probably are n't many assistant coaches at top flight football schools that are child molesters but this one just happened to be at a school where the coach was a legend that had been there forever , and not just winning but running a "@ clean @" program in the sense that historically mattered such as making your players go to class and not paying them money under the table .
And yet since he ( Paterno ) was so old and society had changed so much , he was n't up to speed on just how bad the actions were .
And the guys running the school , who were more up on things , felt they had to defer to the legend Paterno and / or protect the program that had been built up for so long .
You 'd have a hard time writing something like this story .
I read a few times , and maybe one of them was earlier in this thread , that in 2005 or so the PSU President and Athletic Director when to Paterno 's house to try to talk him into retiring and he turned them down .
In normal times that may just give your football program some extra down years while it 's being run by someone too old to be running it but in this case it happened to also be enabling a serial child molester .
Good post , #6 , particularly the last bit .
I 'm 50 .
There definitely was a sea change during the 1970 s .
Still , putting this forth as if it were relevant to anything in the past 30 years is inane and just shows the power of the myth of Legendary Joe Paterno .
Not having known anything different , it 's so weird to me that things used to be this way .
That is , that child sex abuse was so often just swept under the rug .
Particularly because people used to be so much more uptight about sex and how dangerous and corrupting it is .
You 'd think people who thought non procreative sex was so terrible and awful would be more concerned about child molestors and exposing them , not less .
Not as long as I have been alive ( I 'm 30 ) .
Maybe 50 years ago , though , I would n't know about that .
This did not happen 50 years ago .
I do not understand your repeated attempts to rewrite history and make it seem like this is a societal development of the last 5 years , especially considering it requires you to completely ignore the absolute hysteria of the 80 s over child sex abuse .
When I was a kid , just about every family sitcom had a "@ very special episode @" in which one of the child characters found out a friend was being abused in some way , and then went and told a parent or teacher , who then contacted the authorities .
You 're misreading me if you think I am trying to rewrite history or even trying to argue with anybody .
People in the Penn State system knew about Sandusky 's proclivities for decades , but the case did n't get to the Grand Jury until 2009 .
'@ Nuff said ?
- Many people here and elsewhere continue to suggest Paterno not doing more made him an enabler of child sexual abuse .
This is by and large an incredibly unfair label to stick on him .
For one , had the investigation back in 1998 been handled correctly this would never have become an issue .
So , far more to the truth , ALL those who failed back in 1998 are the true enablers .
Secondly , several people either witnessed or were directly told of Sandusky raping a young boy in the showers in 2000 and they did NOTHING .
They did not stop it , they did not report it .
They swallowed their tongues .
They are all far more culpable than Paterno .
What do all these things that other people did or did n't do have to do with judging Paterno 's actions ?
He can n't be a child abuse enabler because other people also had a chance to do something and did n't ?
That 's must makes all of them enablers , including Paterno .
Another point @: With the benefit of hindsight we are outraged by the 40 counts related to sexual abuse and 9 or more victims .
But that 's the result of an investigation that went on for over three years .
We assume Paterno had to know a lot since he was everything to Penn State , but how much did he really know ?
As far as I know , it was the 1998 and 2002 incidents , nothing more .
Should that be enough ? @..
yeah , I think so .
But it 's NOT the 40 counts and 9 @+ victims everyone is judging him by . I think in order to form a final opinion of just how culpable Paterno truly is , we have to first understand exactly what he knew , both in terms of the allegations made against Sandusky and what actions were taken to resolve it .
How many times do we hear the phrase "@ how could they not have seen what was going on @" when in fact , they honestly did n't .
( this speaks directly to the accusation of being an enabler , which to me is a conscious action or role .
But if you simply did not see what was going on , for whatever reason , then you can n't be an enabler ) .
I can n't speak for anyone else , but my decision is based solely on the fact that , regardless of how the 1998 incidents turned out , Paterno deliberately downplayed the 2002 incident while knowing that Sandusky had been accused before for the same thing by different kids .
I 'm judging him on what he did , not how many counts Sandusky was indicted on .
And finally , I have often heard the commentary that this was a cover @-@ up to protect the school or football program , but I still do n't understand what this exactly means .
Typically , if you are protecting the school or football program , you are hiding activity taken by the school or football program that benefited the school or the football program .
But when it was first discovered that Sandusky was sexually abusing children , this had nothing to do with the school or the football program per se .
It was entirely about a sexual predator that managed to operate within the confines of the school and it 's football program while going undetected .
The school had nothing to gain but everything to lose by hiding it .
Exactly how would it have hurt the school or the football program if Sandusky was exposed right from the start ?
And remember , back in 1998 the relationship between Paterno and Sandusky was very strained .
They never really cared for one another to begin with , but it had gotten far worse over the last few years Sandusky was there .
To suggest that Paterno would have known exactly what Sandusky was alleged to have done and opted to protect him , for reasons I can n't fathom , seems very unlikely .
So what am I missing ??
Paterno lost his job because of what Sandusky did .
Surely he was intelligent enough to foresee that possibility .
I 'm not sure it 's beyond the pale to suggest that Paterno may have considered his own firing to be a negative turn of events that the football program needed to be protected from .
I have participated actively in this thread for a few reasons .
One is that it 's helped me come to grips with this tragedy that implicates people and an institution that I admire ( d ) .
A big reason , though , has been for accuracy 's sake .
I know a lot more about Paterno than most people do , and characterizations of him as some evil mastermind valuing a winning football program above all else - morality be damned - are flat wrong .
If for no other purpose than for people who do n't know anything about the man to get the tragic irony of this case ( i.e. , that it involves the squeakiest of the squeaky @-@ clean ) it 's been important to set the record straight .
It 's easy to just conclude that his response makes him a total low @-@ life ; the truth is more complicated @: he really is a man of impeccable character who did absolutely the wrong thing when presented with this situation , and he deserves to be punished for it .
Vicki Triponey 's comments suggest that he did indeed value his football program above many more important things .
Power corrupts , and this scandal has shown pretty clearly that Paterno was no exception to that rule .
I 'm sorry , but I think you 're reacting out of emotion because you bought into the myth of Paterno as the squeakiest of the squeaky clean .
He was not some wonderful man who inexplicably did a bad thing .
He was a fallible being , like all of us , who did good and bad things .
Better he should be remembered that way than as some phony secular saint .
I do n't think alimony needs to keep the lesser earning spouse up in the "@ lifestyle to which they had become accustomed @" indefinitely , but I do think that a lot of times spouses ( usually women ) put their careers on the back burner to support the breadwinning spouse .
They miss out on income and earning potential / career growth / education while boosting those same things for their spouse .
If they divorce , I think they deserve at least some money as compensation for what they gave up and to help them get back on their feet .
This is extremely well said .
Where I bristle at it is in situations where the decision for one spouse to stay home was n't made together .
Like , the wife unilaterally decides to stop working , or one spouse is completely unable to hold a job because s/he is immature , lazy , etc. I 'm not sure what percentage of alimony payments go to people like this , but it makes me uncomfortable that it can happen and I judge the hell out of people like that that demand and accept alimony .
It 's hard for a third party to say in retrospect whether it was a mutual decision or not , but if one spouse has been out of work for many years , it kind of seems like the courts have to assume the other spouse must have been okay with it for the marriage to have lasted so long .
How about this situation @: 2 people get married as undergrads , graduate with their bachelor degrees , and make the decision that person A will work and support person B + kids while person B gets their graduate degree , then person B will work while person A gets their graduate degree .
Person B asks for a divorce 6 months before getting their degree .
you JUST described my parents - my mom DID get alimony for a few years ( 5 or so ) .
I 'm coming from a different perspective but it is n't out of date .
I stopped practicing law when we had kids because one of our careers needed to go on the back burner .
Since DH and I have been together and I stopped practicing , his income has more than doubled .
Because I do 95 % of the child rearing / cooking / cleaning he is able to do what he does .
I still work part time , but my earning potential is not even close to what it was before I stopped practicing if I ever needed to go back full-time .
We made this choice together and if he decides to run off with callista gingrich why should my standard of living suffer ?
I can understand why it would be necessary in your situation , but I think it needs to have a defined time limit .
My perspective is coming from the fact that I 'm divorced and my XH tried to milk me for everything I 'm worth , even though he cheated on me .
Michigan is a no @-@ fault divorce state , so had we have been married longer or if he was laid off before our divorce , could have been responsible for spousal support .
I 'm just a really independent and would n't need or want anyone supporting me .
I would figure it out on my own .
Hi Everyone @......
Have found an open computer at the library so thought it was a good time to let you know how things are .
The fire on Tuesday gutted the pumphouse , a 6 @'@ x6'x8 @' structure .
Hence the name , the well pump was inside and there will n't be any water for awhile .
The fire spread to the entryway and pretty much gutted that along with the phone lines .
What is left of the entryway has to come down along with perhaps the outside living room wall and the deck of course .
Somewhere along the line , the fire jumped to the house roof which was very unfortunate .
The fire department had a difficult time extinguishing that portion and roof boards were damaged leaving a hole .
In order to find the real extent of what the fire did , the north wall of the kitchen will need to be removed ( inside and out ) along with some of the vault down to the studs , and the roof of course .
Due to the age of the home ( 1890 ) and the extensive remodeling that has occurred before I got there , nothing can be determined from the attic or the roof portion in that particular section unless a tear down occurs .
The house if livable , although without water .
I made a decision to stay in the house and not go to a hotel .
There is some smoke damage and I am finding soot in the weirdest places like behind the top of the toilet tank .
If I can get outside every 4 hours for a breath of fresh air , it 's helpful .
The first well pump person came this morning and was of no help .
The second person that came was very helpful and is coming again tomorrow with an estimate .
The adjuster and the contractor are also coming tomorrow and that will all take a couple of hours at least to sort through things .
A structure has to be built first before the pump can be installed .
Was a fitful night for sleep , but it was tempered with the fact that I live in a small community and have people around me that are totally awesome .
From the passerby 's Tuesday morning who called 911 and went in the house to rescue any animals at their own peril , to those who lived close and kept me informed and stayed until the rescue people left .
The phone was busy with people calling , sometimes twice
to make sure that I was OK .
Special thanks have to go out to my assistant Randy , who on the last 10 minutes of my commute was with me via phone the entire time .
I can not express my gratitude for that action .
The fire was in the same exact location that it was 30 years ago .
Pretty freaky .
Thank you for your thoughts , it 's getting me through .
For some reason though , the song Disco Inferno keeps running through my head .
Deb
Deb , Glad to see that your Ok .
Well so to speak considering your dilema .
I hope the insurance corrects things quickly for you as you have spent considerable time and money fixing up the place .
Must be pretty nerve racking i imagine .
On the good side though your handy man will be around for some time apparently .
Good luck girl and hang in there !
Just talked to Debbie - the insurance guy is out there now already been there 2 and a half hours and is still checking out the outside @.....
she is in fairly good spirits and cheerful .
glad to hear you , re ok .
Excellent news .
Sorry to hear about the fire , been there as a kid , but really glad to hear that you are well and on top of thing 's .
Do the repair work and sell the place , in about 25 years or so
If you have to go to the library to use the computer , maybe you should do some research on the houses history , who built it and lived there , and any mysterious circumstances .
I love old houses , and ghost stories
Sounds like your neighbours are top notch people .
Tony
I 'm sorry to hear about the fire Deb , but I 'm glad no one was hurt and that your animals came through unscathed . Sounds like you have some fantastic neighbors
Debbie , do you mind putting up some pictures of the place ?
I have a hard time picturing the "@ pump room @" and walk way and deck in my mind .
"@ plane ticket , put the workboots , patterned stockings and tool belt back in the closet along with the bra that covers nothing @"
Hoping that none of this was damaged in the fire .
Hooray -------@ for a temporary phone line !
Hello everybody ,
People started to show up here at 7 @:@ 30 this morning and it 's been quite a flurry of activity .
Two contractors , an adjustor , the phone company plus a subrogate investigator .
The investigator was called in thinking that the former owners actions had somehow caused the fire with the way the heat tape was being utilized .
With that phone call , everything here ground to a halt .
Debris could not be removed , the plumber could not commence , nothing could go any further .
At 2 @:@ 30 pm , the investigator did determine that it was the pump motor itself which was the cause , not the former homeowners actions .
Since it is so late in the day now , everything has to wait until tomorrow .
On Friday , the new pump motor will be put on , and a temporary structure will be built .
The entryway will be torn off and debris will be picked up , but far as anything permanent , that is weeks if not months away .
Thanks for all your concern @.........

Does your daughter know about him ?
Does she know that he is married ?
If the answer is "@ no @" to both these questions , how would you feel about her finding out ?
In the future , Would you be happy if she were ( a ) in your position or ( b ) in the position of your lover 's wife ?
Or his daughter ?
No she does not know about , but my son , who is 22 is aware of it and has met him .
I do not want her to know as I do n't feel there is any benefit to her knowing as things currently stand .
I honestly would not want her to be in any of those positions , I certainly did n't ever intend to find myself in the position that I am currently in , but I am , and now I 'm trying to decide what to do .
Walk away NOW .
Quote @:
I expect that 's what his wife and kids think too .
Clear off out of his life or accept that you 're a second class woman playing second fiddle at his convenience because he can n't keep either his mouth or his pants zipped .
That 's not a good role model for your kids .
I 'm not a second class woman though you 're correct that I am playing second fiddle at the moment !
Quote @:
I have a very close friend who is in a similar situation he is married with no children , she is in a relationship with someone , but when you see them together you can see that they really do both love each other , I have even said to my friend that one day you will have a ultimation the wife or your girlfriend , he has said he would leave his wife for her , yes its all wrong but he has said , we only live once and this is not a rehersal , yes i agree that even a person who is married can fall in love with somebody else , and its life and it happens every day
Of course someone who is married can fall in love with someone else , however he should have the courage of his convictions and be with with your friend , not string her and his wife along .
Quote @:
You 're a woman who does n't mind being part of a situation that will cause huge amounts of pain and grief to another woman and her children .
You might not like the expression '@ second class @' , but you and this man certainly do n't have any other type of class .
Seriously , sisterhood , where did it go ?
Quote @:
I do know that things are n't always rosy for him at home , but I try to keep my thoughts to myself .
Sorry sweetheart , but that is the oldest line in the book .
It 's what ALL men having an affair with no intention of leaving their wives say .
They have separate rooms , but yes I 'm sure they do sleep together occasionally
And so is this , honestly .
Really , he 's making a fool of you .
Quote @:
So basically , you are n't happy in this relationship ?
Quote @:
I am single , he has been married for 21 years .
both our youngest children have just taken their GCSE 's
Balletshoes - '@ The one thing that stopped me was knowing in that relationship I would always play second fiddle , because he was still with his wife .
As much as we had a strong physical attraction and could talk for hours etc. , he was n't committed to me , and could n't ever be while he was still living with his wife .
I know I deserve better - every human being deserves better than that @' .
This is what I am finding so difficult now .
Person @-@ one - '@ Leave him , tell his wife what he 's been up to ( some might disagree but I think she deserves to know what she 's married to ) and never look back .
' I could not do this , there would be nothing to be gained by telling her , apart from causing a lot of hurt , and making me look like Iwant some kind of revenge , which I do n't .
Regardless of the moral aspect , you are putting all the decision making power of this relationship in his hands .
To redress the balance , you can leave him and move on .
Take back your independence .
If he really wants to be with you , he will make it happen .
I very much doubt he will do anything other than moan to you about your decision though ( so be prepared and stay strong ) .
So really , the best thing for you to do is leave him and move on .
There are plenty of lovely , single guys out there ( and any married man playing the field does n't fit my definition of lovely , so do take off your rose tinted glasses too ) .
As peachy said my friend is in the situation where he may shortly make the decision to leave his wife for his girlfriend , she is in a relationship with somebody who she does not love and they have not slept together for a long time , and believe me they are in love but regarding the op she must make her own decision and go along with it
Quote @:
The existence of 2 ( presumably ) youngish children would suggest that the marriage is not the cold and unrewarding one the husband would have you believe .
The oldest child is at university , the youngest will be starting A levels this year
You have no evidence whatsoever that his home life is barren and unhappy .
If it was so desperate , so stultifying , so lacking in affection , he would have told her and taken steps to end the marriage @...
for his own sake !
Perhaps , but perhaps not
If you think she just needs the gentlest of nudges to decide that the marriage is n't worth salvaging , why not drop her a line and ask her what she thinks about the present situation and how best to resolve the difficulties .
It 's not my place to tell her and nor would I , under any circumstances
If he wants to end the marriage and be with me , then that 's his decision
Quote @:
You 're right I do have conflicting feelings .
I can n't carry on as I am , so I do need to know what his long term intentions are .
I might not like the answer , but I know I do have to find out .
Good luck with that .
He can tell you anything he thinks will keep you pacified .
Quote @:
Leaving aside the morality of affairs for a moment , I wonder how you could be happy being treated this way by any man .
It seems to me that you fit in around his life , when it suits him then you can meet up ?
We meet when it is convenient to both of us If it is n't too personal a question , what do you do ?
Find a room ?
Nope , as I have said before we have n't been up to much of that .
The few times it has happened has been when he 's visiting me and there 's been no one in at my house I 'm sorry but from here it all seems a little tawdry - do n't you deserve better than this ?
Yes , and i 'd like more than that too
As for affairs , well , my Mum had one when I was 16 and left my Dad .
I was devastated at the time - called her some names that even now I blush to recall but with the benefit of maturity and some distance I can see that it was the best decision for all concerned .
My Mum married the other man and stayed with him until he died .
My Dad met a lovely woman and also remarried .
My sister and me , after a tumultuous month or two , got on with our lives .
Affairs do cause a lot of emotional upheaval and unhappiness but the long term outcome does n't necessarily need to be a bad one .
I 'm pleased your parents went on to live happy lives with their new partners
Quote @:
Good luck OP , not everyone on here thinks youre a deluded STI ridden harlot who is trying to steal someone elses man .
I hope things work out for you and you find happiness whatever decision you make
Thank you
I do n't mean to be dense , but why do you have to find out what HIS long term intentions are ?
What are YOURS ?
I would be more concerned with his short term intentions to be honest , you could spend years listening to excuses and waiting for him to leave .
Are you really happy with the possibilty of waiting for all that time only to be in the exact same position years from now ?
If you want to be with him you do have to lay your cards on the table , you have to mean it too and be prepared to walk away if he is n't commited to leaving his marriage in the near future .
Quote @:
My husband had a three and a half year affair .
He promised her the world , and on the basis of this , she had his baby .
He did n't leave me , had no intentions of doing so .
She was a convenient physical repository , someone to talk to , someone who thought that the sun shone out of his backside , and he basked in the adulation .
When push came to shove , he chose to stay with me .
I chose to allow him to do so .
I did , however , keep in contact with his mistress , as much to get answers to my myriad of questions as to keep an eye on her .
( she was so smitten that she turned down a chance to emigrate to NZ and made a million and one excuses for him when heir child died without him even bothering to visit her ) And , funnily enough , she was shocked when I told her of the affairs he had following the demise of their relationship ; she truly thought that she was the one , rather than a convenience .
I am heart sorry for you .
Quote @:
i have been following this post due to the situation i found myself in .
Bit of background
Going through a divorce · 3 children
I had been with my husband for over 20 @+ years when end of last year , he announced he do n't love me know more and was leaving .
he did n't leave that night as he did n't know how to tell the children .
about a week later the phone bill arrived and there was a number i did n't recognised that he had been contacting from the time he got up till the time WE went to bed , for months .
When i confronted him he told me it was a woman from work who was a close friend .
he told the children and left that night .
He moved into his parents and within a few weeks he was sleeping with her .
At first i had the support of his parents but that soon diminished .
As obv they stood by their son .
Roll on too now .
i can n't describe to you the hurt and humiliation that you feel .
that everyone knew and was laughing at you , to watch my children crumble before your very eyes , the man they used to look at with such admiration they look at with contempt .
i do n't slag him off in front of the children or refuse to allow him contact .
he chooses not to see them unless he can be bothered .
to listen to your kids crying at night as they have been replaced by her children .
Yes he is still with her .
Are they happy i have no clue .
He tells the children he lives with his parents and his parent keep this up he infact stays over every night at her house .
The children do not want to meet her under any circumstances .
so he has to live a lie im not sure if the kids will ever meet her or be told the truth as to where he his living .
We have lost family members that we were very close to how can those trelationships ever be put right .
I try my best to keep going and hold my head up high and keep letting the kids know that they are loved .
but you end up living on your nerves as you are never quite sure whats going to be thrown at you next .
My husband had never been unfaithful before she knew he was married with children as she had met us .
I suspect he has told her he was unhappy etc. Maybe he was BUT we were still intimate right up until he left ( do you think he told her that ) .
We had plans for the future and were discussing how to make those plans a reality .
So for all you know he could be doing the same to his wife .
I was totally devasted and to some extent still am .
Would i have believed that he was capable of causing so much hurt and devastation .
Never .
He is now not the man i was with for all of those years i do n't even recognise him or his actions .
It makes you wonder if the whole of your life has been 1 big lie .
So yes his wife has the right to know i wish someone had told me that he was flirting with someone else whilst making promises to me .
then i would n't have felt that he had ripped my heart out of my chest and stamped on it .
I would have been prepared for the whole of my life and my kids lives to be turned upside down but most of all i would have had a choice in the outcome .
Purpletoenails - read that post above and really take in the pain this ALWAYS causes and be ashamed of yourself .
A married man is out of bounds and YOU should have walked away double quick , NO excuses .
Women like you disgust me .
and I know this because my ex ripped my heart out the day I gave birth to our beautiful little girl .
He moved out and in with her whilst I was in hospital .
Roll on nearly 10 years and they got married , had a baby and now he has done exactly the same to her and is living with the next victim .
Be warned @...
( and I think I 'll duck now before I get shot down in flames !
Quote @:
If he did n't leave pretty much immediately , he probably will n't at all .
I agree with this .
It also has to be his choice to leave .
The relationship can work out and often does .
Its the reason the marriage is unhappy that needs to be addressed or there is a good chance of repeating the same problems and being unhappy all over again .
Quote @:
Yes it can , no denying that , but people get hurt as a result of affairs .
people get hurt for all sorts of reasons and my experience is genuine people do n't embark on an affair in a foolhardy fashion it is done with care and consideration of everyone involved .
They slip into it and do n't run into it and it happens because they are not happy in their marriage .
Some people look to repairing the marriage and some people can n't .
Blame does n't help .
Quote @:
I think it is actually quite straight forward really .
He is either totally sincere , totally confused at what is happening to him , trully totally in love with you , and the only truthful reason why he is still with his wife is because he can n't bear not seeing his children regularly any longer .
This , unfortunately , although possible , is not the most likely case .
However , if it is , he most likely would not be waiting until seeing you again to discuss what you have said to you .
He would be calling you , telling you that he has been thinking of what you 've said every day , that he understand how you feel and know how totally unfair it is for you to be put in the situation you are in , and that he has decided either to set you free and stop the relationship because there is no way he can take the chance not to have regular contact with his children any longer , or , that he has decided that he could n't keep expecting you to accept the situation as it is and therefore decided to leave his wife there and then .
Or @....
he does care very much for you , even probably trully love you , however , not enough to be prepared to leave not just his kids , but maybe the wife who despite what he might say , actually also still love very much , or worse , not leave the comfort that comes with the relationship , or lose out financially through the divorce she will ask for , all the money he worked very hard to earn .
However , despite what you told him , he does n't want to lose what he has with you , and so is most likely to wait until you are meeting again to discuss the conversation , likely to wait until you bring it up again , and likely to give a sob story about how much he loves you , does n't want to lose you and therefore he has decided to leave his wife , however , he needs to sort out a few things before he does it officially .
He will try to keep you hanging on for how long as possible , probably already knowing that the time has come for this arrangement to end , but trying to keep it going and enjoying it for how long as it can last because you start to realise that he trully never intend to leave .
One sure thing , you need to separate his feelings for you from the actions he is capable of taking .
Even if he does love you as much as you believe he does , it does n't mean he is trully prepared to leave for many reasons @...
even more afraid of any confrontations with his wife than he loves you , even more attached to his financial stability than he loves you , even more concern about his status and what people think of him than he loves you @...
In the end , you are now at the stage where his love his not enough , what you need is action , this means things changing now , when he might decide that a good compromise is just to make promises @...
That was a great post thank you
Any or all of the above could be true .
Quote @:
So what will you say & do if he does say he does n't know ?
That 's the easy way out for him , is n't it ?
He does n't have to make a decision and he 'll hope that things just drift on as before .
It was you who posted that you were getting fed up of things as they are .
Do you have the courage to walk away ?
Yes , I 'm really hoping that I have
Quote @:
Is n't it exciting , she can walk away , leave things as they be or stage a takeover bid .
I hope the rest of the thread contains some comment on the morality of this .
Quote @:
Do n't see what is so '@ exciting @' about all this , I find it all quite unfortunate · the position of all parties involved .
Morals are not popular !
Quote @:
I think most of the posts have been highly critical of the OP actually .
I have my own moral standards but prefer not to make judgement on others in these circumstances .
Everybody seems to be trying to up the ante and make this more stressful for the OP .
I 'm just looking at it in a different way .
Why make oneself ill over something that is part of life .
I think in some respects that is why we are where we are with societal decline .
Moral standards in certain areas are not subjective .
Adultery is wrong , no if 's or buts , simply , @...
wrong .
If you fall out of love with your partner , if you fall in love with someone else , do the decent thing , leave them , then do what you have to .
Be honest , do n't lie , do n't cheat .
Being judgmental is not always a negative trait .
Quote @:
I agree with you but do n't think '@ exciting @' is appropriate terminology in the circumstances .
My mum died of cancer last April and I can n't cope without her .
She was my best friend and we did everything together .
I saw her all the time and we spoke about 6 times a day on the phone up until she was very ill in her last weeks and sleepy with morphine .
I have suffered from anxiety and depression in the past and she was the one person who could calm me down and make everything alright .
Yesterday I was due to have an operation to remove my gallbladder and I was actually at the hospital and booked in when I told them I was feeling unwell and left .
I am so scared of having the operation and imagine all the horrible things that could go wrong , I had an op once before but mum was helping me cope with my nerves and helped me go through it .
Yesterday I just kept thinking I need mum , I can n't do it without her .
It 's so stupid because I will still have to have it done and she will n't be there .
I sit at home during the day and cry and cry . I hold my hands together and keep praying she will come back , I say over and over again "@ Please come back , please come back @" like it will make a difference but I know it can n't happen , I just want a miracle .
My husband tries so much to help and is so kind but it is n't the same and I 'm scared of stressing him out .
The night before I was due my operation I was in such a state and he was trying to calm me and I saw his eyes were bloodshot .
He has high blood pressure and I thought "@ Omg I 'm going to end up killing him @"
My kids are wonderful but my misery stresses them out , I really really try to hid it but they hear me blowing my nose alot and notice my eyes are red .
I have been on meds ( citalopram ) in the past but they make me feel really weird and I do n't like taking them .
I go to a counsellor which is great when I 'm with her but when I 'm alone I start feeling low again .
I hate myself for being so stupid and not coping .
I 'm an adult , and a wife and a mum .
I know what a stress and misery I am for my family to be around , but I do n't believe I will ever get better without mum here to help me .
I miss her so so much , I need her back , I can n't believe she has gone forever - it is n't possible .
I 'm so desperate I just do n't know what to do , I want to hide in a corner and pretend none of this is happening .
Please please can someone tell me how to cope , or even just hold up for my family .
Your anchor has been ripped away and you are cut adrift on a stormy sea .
Under the circumstances , when you were so very close this is completely understandable .
It 's very difficult to manage without someone who was so important in our lives .
If the grief and loss is having an overwhelming impact on your life , then I suggest that you consider a different grief @-@ couseller to try to learn how you can cope better and move forward to a happier life without her .
If she were here with you now do you think she would want you to be so very unhappy ?
You are not stupid !
You are suffering terribly and you need different help .
I lost my Mum and I felt the same way , for quite a long time , so I think I understand how it is for you .
There is a good future and you will recover .
You will
Quote @:
Go and see your GP and see if he / her has an alternative
Angel , you do n't need to hide the pain or hold up for your family .
They can cope seeing your pain because they are stronger than you think .
Your husband sounds lovely , Lean on him .
Hard
So sorry for your loss and feeling so sad .
I agree that you need to see the gp and try some counselling .
I had my gallbladder removed last April , keyhole surgery .
I feel much better now , had to stay in hospital 2 days longer due to infection and having a drain but a month later I could eat a lot more food and felt physically better .
Sending lots of love x
It might be an idea to see your GP as a matter of some urgency .
At the moment you 're catastrophising everything , and it does n't have to be like that .
I did n't want to read and run hun .
Definitely go back to your doctor , try and get some grief counselling , do n't be afraid to lean on people for help .
I do hope that you can find some comfort soon xxx
You 're not stupid !
It 's not stupid that you 're missing your Mum , it 's perfectly understandable .
You 're overwhelmed .
You need to talk to your GP again .
Do you talk to anyone about how you 're feeling or are you bottling it up , trying to look like you 're managing to cope with it all ?
I 'm sure your children are worried about you and I 'm sure they 'd appreciate you telling them how you 're feeling , rather than them fretting because they 're seeing their Mum upset .
Maybe they do n't realise just how much it 's affecting you , the same with your husband , and if they knew I 'm sure they 'd try and help you more .

i have to say that as I read your post I had tears in my eyes .
My own mum has cancer , in her breast 3 years ago and unfortunately we were told in October that it had returned in her bones .
I have the same relationship with my Mum as you have with yours and thinking of my life without her reduces me to tears on a daily basis .
She too is on morphine and we have good days and bad .
I will n't offer you any advice as I know that when the time comes I will suffer in exactly the same way as you are now .
What I will say however is try to stay strong and think how sad your Mum would be to see you so distressed .
If shes anything like mine she will want you to remember her with fondness as you move on with your life , making her proud of the person you have become WHICH IS ALL THANKS TO HER X
Stay strong x
Hi i completely know where your coming from i too lost my mum to cancer at the age of 51 , it was a very short illness diagnosed in the October and she passed on 31 st May 08 .
My mum too was my right arm went everywhere together i phoned her every day .
I was dumbfounded that my mum was gone just like that .
I cried for my mum but i do n't think i 've ever grieved properly as i had my dad , brother and my two young children who were 3 and 1 at the time and i had to be strong for them .
Moving on 3 years and i am now suffering from anxiety / panic attacks and have been quite ill for the past 4 @-@ 5 months , the dr thinks it could all be down to my loss as since my mums passing i 've lost my nan , grandad , 2 uncles and my beautiful 25 day old niece .
I 'm currently having counselling and I 'm hoping this works .
I think you need to stick with your counselling and it sounds like you have a very understanding husband so lean on him all you can .
Big hugs the day to day things do get easier but the pain of loss never goes away , just be assured that your mum is always with you and loves you very much .

I have only ready the first two pages , but had to write right away because OMG @....
I could have written almost exactly the same than you .
Like you and husband , my partner and I earn just over £ 90 K .
Like you , we live in the SE and like you we deal with a VERY expensive housing market .
I think most people here are completely clueless at the differences in the cost of living .
A three bedroom semi in nice but not best area in our town start at about £ 260 and that 's not even as expensive as some of the nearest towns .
Like you , i work full-time , except in my case , I can n't say I enjoy it .
It used to be challenging is a nice way , but now it is only pressure , stress and slavery .
They have relacated our office three times in 6 years now , and I have to travel 1 hour 15 minutes morning and evening .
I too have two children , and do all the drop off / pick ups , as organising the holidays and everything else relating to them .
My partner is not their dad and their dad is useless , so can n't help that much .
Like you , I am absolutely shattered and feel I have no life , and I too feel bitter that I do n't get to enjoy our money because once everything is paid , we do n't have that much disposable income .
I know it might sound incredible to many , but it is the reality .
Once we have paid the mortage , the bills , childcare ( no help ) , there is n't that much left .
The main reason is that we are repaying our mortgage so that we have paid everything in 7 years .
That 's my partner 's decision , not mine , it does cause issues in our relationship , but it is one thing my partner will n't buldge on .
I see his point , I just wish we could enjoy our money more .
Like you , holidays are at family homes abroad , and like you , although I am grateful for it , it is more a resting holiday than an exciting one .
I look at the cost of everything when I do my weekly shopping at Tesco , I now shop exclusively in charity shops , my children only get clothes from supermarkets and only when they are on sale !
I go to get my hair done two or three times a year , have never had a manicure , padicure , self tan or whatever else you can spend your money on !
Like you , my friends either do n't work or only work part-time and seem to enjoy a lot more things that I do , and I to wonder some time how they do it , although I know for a couple of them , they received quite a decent inheritance , others are quite into debts , and others have remortgage their house many time .
So ok , we are more responsible , but I am not sure it is so worth it .
I can n't give up my job .
So for anyone who reads how wonderful life would be earning over £ 45 K , believe me , if you live in the SE , once you 've paid for your taxes and receiving nothing back , you are not as rich as you might think .
Of course you have the luxury of not having to worry how you going to put food on the table or pay the next electricity bill , but you usually do n't get where you are without having worked very hard for it , and the exhaustion that can come with what such a salary entails is not always worth it .
As I said above , as you have n't read the whole thread you might be unaware that the OP 's salary from her full time job sits untouched in the bank each month - so your circumstances on the surface seem similar but if you were in her situation I think you might think '@ stuff the job @' would you not ?
Quote @:
Resenting part time & SAHM is ridiculous .
You & your husband have made your choices & now you have to live with them .
Obviously paying off the mortgage quickly is far more important than quality of life .
Most Part time & SAHMs make lots of sacrifices to be with their children .
Unfortunately resentment , along with jealousy , bitterness and anger , is one of those emotions we can n't help feeling !
Telling people not to feel the way they do is pretty much one of the most unhelpful things you can do !
Quote @:
Also , as this poster did n't read the whole thread they will be unaware that the OPs monthly wage sits untouched in the bank , so their situations are not so similar after all !
Actually , our situations are VERY similar .
I could n't believe how similar they are , in fact .
My main salary sits in the bank because I have n't got mortgage yet to pay off so I am not spending it .
But if we are to take out the mortgage we are aiming for repaying it in full would amaizingly too take us 7 years ( honestly , I did calculations ) .
That 's what I was thinking of doing too .
[QUOTE=make me wise;44480052] Did anyone ; family , friends , teachers etc. ever praise you as a child OP ?
Not just when you achieved something , but along all the little steps it took to acomplish something .
My view is that you do n't seem to look at how much you have achieved and feel a sense of pride in yourself .
QUOTE ]
Actually no , they did n't .
My mum wanted me to achieve a lot and I was a straight A student , from school year 1 up until graduation from University .
She used to say that for me to get a B is worse than to get a D . So I guess I am indeed a perfectionist .
Sadly , my mum has passed away already a few years back ( as has my dad ) , both in their early fifties .
And I think the reason I am trying so hard might be because they would expect me to do well in life so I am still trying to make them proud .
To be perfectly honest , it is killing me to think that I am not living up to my mum 's expectations , whatever they were .
Quote @:
Can I ask OP , what sort of wealth did your family have growing up ?
Is this a case of not having much and trying to build it all up in one generation ?
Or is it a case of trying to match the level of your parents but with different incomes ?
I went to a state school but it was selective .
I come from a middle @-@ class family but after my parents divorced life became more difficult financially .
We were never poor as such but it was difficult for mum .
SInce then I am terrified of having no money .
So the mere thought of having savings in the bank makes me feel content .
I guess that 's part of the reason why we did so well saving up 90 K .
[QUOTE=Despera;44498082] Quote @:
Did anyone ; family , friends , teachers etc. ever praise you as a child OP ?
Then this is what you need help with .
Go get counselling , I am sure that your parents would have been proud of you whatever you achieved , only it looks like they never got a chance to tell you this .
I reckon this is the issue you need help with .
When you have paid your mortgage you are still going to feel this way unless you get some help for your feelings .
When you get your £ 500 k house , it 'll still not be good enough because you have these unresolved issues .
Sorry if this is not what you wanted to hear but I think you need counselling to deal with your parents death and their assumed expectations .
Quote @:
I really do n't understand people who have children , then insist that the children must have the best of everything , so work all the hours under the sun and moon in order to pay for *@ the best @* when the really best thing for those children is quality time spent with their parents .
Children are only children for such a very short time and they do n't need holidays in florida , private education and all the other trappings that *@ the Jones'* have .
What they NEED , is a parents undivided attention .
Time to take them to the park , bake cakes , go splashing in puddles and days out at the seaside .
OP , you have your values and priorities wrong .
There has been a lot of very good advice given to you , I really hope you take it , for the sake of your health and especially for the sake of your children .
Fantastic post Wish I could thank it more than once
Quote @:
Get them charged .
On 29 Dec a few years ago me and my friend were walking up the street to catch a taxi .
We had had words with a man in a nightclub earlier , he was from Nigeria , I do n't remember exactly what had happened in the nightclub but I think he had come on to my friend and she turned him down and he did n't like it .
Anyway he caught up with us as we were walking to the taxi , he ended up arguing with me mainly , he went to punch me , my friend pushed me out of the way , and then he punched her in the face .
He broke her jaw in 3 places , a couple of lads were across the street and they chased him but did n't manage to catch him ( they were chavs )
We went to hopsital as she was in pain and it was confirmed that she had a broken jaw , we reported it to the police and they took us in for a interview , we were interviewed separate .
They somehow knew who we were talking about , he must have been known to them as they showed us a pic of a man and it was him .
So then we went to court , and thankfully one of the chavs had offered to be a witness as well , I was bricking it to stand up in court
But thankfully when he arrived in court too , he saw that all 3 witness'es had turned up he changed his plea to guilty
He got sent to jail for 6 months and the was being deported .
So its def worth reporting it
Again , very different circumstances to what happened to the OP 's DD . A broken jaw in an unprovoked attack with independent witnesses to give evidence is very different from "@ bruising @" following a spat in a club that 's spilled out onto the street .
Jxx
Quote @:
And I am sure the police ( with the help of CCTV ) will investigate any attack and decide on the outcome .
Quote @:
I am very very suprised by the actions of the police in this case .
If a crime is committed surely they are duty @-@ bound to investigate and prosecute , rather than just leaving it up to the victim to decide ?
It 's up to the POLICE to check cctv - that 's their job for heaven 's sake .
Remember the hoo @-@ haa about the Jordan rape claim a little while back ?
The police questioned her even though she was adamant she did n't want to do anything about it .
That 's what they are supposed to do - or else surely they are just allowing people to get away with stuff due to witnesses / victins feeling vulnerable ?
My friend 's OH was set upon by a group of lads outside a pub in the early hours and even though he was drunk and probably behaving provocatively the police were very professional and used cctv evidence to prosecute .
His attacker got 6 months and had to pay him compensation .
What they 'll often do if there 's been a melee outside a club and the person who has been assualted refuses to press charges , is charge the protagonists with a public order offence ( if they have the CCTV or other solid evidence to back it up ) usually section 4 , or a more serious section 3 affray if there 's a large number of people causing trouble .
I 'm surprised by your second point though - normally when someone is sent to prison they do n't have to pay compensation as well as they would be deemed to have no way to pay it ( because they 're in prison , obviously ) .
Jxx
I think any act of violence on another person needs taking seriously .
The girls would otherwise do it again and may even harm someone seriously .
My son was also subjected to an unprovoked attack in which he nearly died .
Both lads went to prison "@ briefly @" but at least they may just think twice before doing it again .
Both lads had viewed a fight as part of a normal night out beforehand .
Your daughter is what we call in the trade an unreliable witness .
She got thrown out of the club for some reason .
I 'm sure the club will give the police full details .
She was too drunk to give an account of what happened to the police at the time - that 's not a good starting point for a prosecution .
There are CCTV pictures which may well show ( and you have to be prepared for this ) things you would rather not see - eg daughter mouthing off .
You 've only got one side of the story .
I suspect that once the police have interviewed club staff , seen the CCTV and interviewed the other parties they 'll come up with a less clear @-@ cut picture of what happened .
In fact , your daughter may find herself facing a prosecution for a public order offence .
Ideally , insult their manhood until they took a swing at me then beat their asses in "@ self @-@ defense . @"

Texas has one of the most liberal gun laws in the country , yet it did little good in this case .
Jesus was never in the bar and did n't know what had happened in there .
He was inside playing video games and had gone outside to move his car when he encountered the two .
Whatever happened then is what lead up to the shooting .
After shooting he immediately called the police and waited for them .
Does n't sound like somebody who just wanted to shoot two guys for no reason .
Suspicious is why Jesus felt he needed to "@ move his car @" at that particular time .
And John 's relative 's statement about what she overheard on the cell phone call moments before John was shot .
And the fact that John had been shot through the windshield of his car .
And that both victims were unarmed .
But still , I see your point about reasonable doubt .
Actually it does n't and they were far LESS liberal at the time of the shooting .
Thus they changed them after the shooting .
Texas remains one of a handful of states that bans open carry and requires guns to be concealed .
Do you ever wonder why the people Brown employed felt able to behave for years in such a way ?
They smeared the careers of Brown 's opponents in the Labour Party , leaking information about private lives etc. But you are sure Brown himself "@ behaved properly @" .

With specific regards to his child 's health , there have been rumblings for the last few hours that no hacking occurred and that a "@ friend @" leaked the information .

That 's certainly not what Brown is saying @:

Nothing concrete yet @- <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=tombradby&original_referer=http://order-order.com/"> just rumblings </a> .
As I said , this is the only thing in a storm of flying muck , that is being refuted and there must be a reason for it .
One recalls Mr Brown attended Mrs Brooks @' wedding weeks after The Sun broke their front page story about his child
I 'm not sure why Rebekah Brooks is still in her job .
Newsnight ran an interview last night with Rupert Murdoch 's biographer explaining it is a very tight knit familial group .
He offered an anecdote that Rebekah Brooks quit smoking after losing a bet with Murdoch over who would win a swimming race .
Quite they sacrificed NOTW to save executives and may well drop all their UK newspaper holdings to protect the company
No @-@ one is taking responsibility .
Not Rebekah Brooks or some other executive .
Not Assistant Commissioner John Yates or another figure .
Round and round we go
A bit of a feeble response , I have to say .
Completely agree .
The Sun & Sunday Times are small beer to this lot .
Your going to protect the TV side of the business , 10 M people in this country coughing up a minimum of £ 20 a month .

Yes , you 're right , of course .
Steve W
For me , the sickest things of all ( regarding GB 's son ) is n't the hacking , it 's ( a ) that The Sun thought this was a story in the public interest , and that ( b ) we live in a country where people buy a newspaper that saw fit to print the story .
Steve W
Are you insufficiently repulsed by the Sun 's mysteriously @-@ obtained exclusive on Brown 's son 's cystic fibrosis ?
Do n't worry - like everything about the hacking scandal , there are always more details to emerge to compound the horror .
I 've been speaking to a source close to Gordon Brown at the time of the story , who recalls that it was served up with a chaser of threat .
"@ Gordon insisted - despite a heavy brow @-@ beating from Rebekah - that he was not willing to let his son 's medical condition be the stuff of a Sun exclusive , @" recalls this source .
"@ So he put out a statement on PA to spike their scoop and make clear that despite his condition , Fraser was fit and healthy .
The Sun were utterly furious , and Brown 's communications team were told that if Gordon wanted to get into No10 , he needed to learn that was not how things were done . @"
Yes , how DARE the then @-@ chancellor refuse to accept that his child 's health was not technically a commercial Murdoch property ?
I 'd like to tell you there 's a sick bag located in the rear pocket of the seat in front of you .
But I 'm afraid you 're on your own .
Rebekah Brook is probably the most despicable female this country has seen since Myra Hindley .
Worse than Rosemary West and Maxine Carr you reckon
Your posts do n't get any better mate , seriously .

We have n't got to the bottom of this yet .
Seriously Steve , when it comes to tabloids as a whole .
I would n't put it past the Mirror looing into David Cameron 's kids medical history .
I think all this lot operate in a very shady way , I believe that will become apparent if they widen the net and move beyond just Murdoch 's operation .
I liked that video about the Building #13 store somebody posted earlier .
But I have to ask @..
is n't there something in the US regulating stuff like this , especially when it comes to food ?
In that video the guy showed rusty cans of food , eating the contents could probably make you very seriously ill .
A store like this would n't survive in my country , as it would get closed down by state inspectors .
Does n't something like this exist in the US ?
I remember a supermarket in my area having to close down for a few weeks , their only crime was having freezers not quite up to spec .
EDIT @: Oh also , as an amusing side note , we had walmart here for a while but they completely tanked , gave up , and sold their stores to local chains .
I went into a walmart here once and it was pretty much the most confusing experience I ever had .
In the US food manufacturing and preparation is regulated but food retailing is not .
So , any store that prepares food on-site for sale ( like a grocery store with a bakery , deli , or meat counter ) would be inspected by the local health department but stores that stock only pre @-@ packaged foods are unregulated .
I can n't stop laughing at those Dennis Miller dolls .
Too bad the same can not be said for Dennis Miller .
Okay , is it just me , or is there an epidemic lately on these forums of people going on about how things are where they live , but never actually mentioning where the hell it is that they live ?
Am I missing something here ?
Is a poster 's location listed somewhere obvious and I 'm just missing it ?
I 'm sorry to call you out in particular as you are only one of many , many people who do this lately , but goddamn is it annoying to me .
Am I alone here ?
I do inventory and ordering at a Kmart .
I can tell you right off that we have a Dragonball Z VHS tape ( $ 20 ) , a Lizzie Maguire GBA game ( $ 15 ) ( plus several other Disney / Nickelodeon GBA games ) , a pack of Rugrats UNO cards .
I 'll see if I can find anymore weird stuff and take pictures of it .
Also a package of Hanes boxers that has been there since 2000 ( assuming it 's been there since the date written on it ) .
Still rings up $ 12 and it 's yellowed now .

Who cares about weed really ?
What 's the big deal ?
Has anyone ever really heard of a guy going out and smoking too much , and then going home to beat his wife ?
Or breaking into someones house and stealing their stereo for more weed money ?
Does n't happen .
I would rather be on the highway next to a person who is blazed out of their skull than someone who had one too many at the bar .
Now then .
I used to smoke .
A lot .
Too much .
I 'm going to get into trouble here @-- I 've been high around my kids .
I did n't smoke around them , but I was high when I came home .
A lot of times , I 'm just stressed out and annoyed by my kids .
I want to rush them off into bed just to get some peace and quiet .
But when I 've smoked a little , I 'm a great mom .
I 'm happy to sit down and play silly games with them .
I do n't yell .
I can find ways to explain their endless silly questions and it does n't get on my nerves .
I can see them for the beautiful little miracles that they really are .
I guess I 'm just mentioning this , because smoking weed does n't necessarily make you a "@ bad mom @" .
Sometimes it can help you be better .
These days , I do n't seek it out .
I do n't have a problem if I 'm out with friends at the bar , or at a concert and it finds me .
But I know my limits , and if I had it around all the time , it goes badly for me .
I keep a healthy distance , I guess .

Do n't insult me and I will treat you with respect .

I just do n't understand why you have the attack language turned on is all .
Fast forward several years , and now not only do I STILL not get the respect of the people who make $ 250 k+ / yr. but people born with a golden spoon in their mouths , who contribute NOTHING to society , that get high @-@ paying jobs because of connections by their parents , NOTHING to do with what they know get more respect than somebody like me who worked himself so far to the bone that I am now suffering from chronic stomach problems and ulcers , for possibly the rest of my life because of the overstress that I have to deal with .
That relatively ubiquitous sense of snobbery by the rich , as well as ( more importantly ) they 're not technically working significantly harder than any other members of society ( and the poorest members often work harder , given their execrable jobs ) , is why I 'm very happy with progressive taxation .
I was told that back in 1999 , programmers / engineers were being paid on average roughly twice what the average programmer / engineer is being paid now .
Not to mention their hours were easier .
I know somebody working as a web developer in a small company for $ 14 / hr.

So if you 've seen why my tirades have gone so much against conservatives during my time here last year , that 's why . The $ 250,000 mark is roughly 1.5 % .
I know Savage belongs to this elite 1.5 % , but I do not .
I had said in another board that I would make a vow to consistently get to the $ 250 k mark before I died , even if it killed me , so that they have no purpose to call me "@ lazy @" or "@ entitled @" .
I do n't direct those tirades at CFers , or CFers in the Tea Party .
I direct them at Tea Partiers I know who are like this and talk show hosts / politicians who subscribe to this way of thinking since my chances of actually saying it to their face are near zero .
So I just hope Savage or Limbaugh slips into CF one day , finds my tirade , and then goes bananas over it .
Rush has a bit of an ego .
So does Hannity .
Sometimes I listen because they 're less annoying that the stupid Canadian radio stations that drive me up the wall .
I live in a 1 @-@ bedroom apartment .
The other complaint I heard from my parents and other peers from the TP are why do n't I get a house .
Simple .
I do n't feel like getting one right now .
The market is n't going to go up for at least 3 @-@ 4 years for houses I feel .
And I want to wait until I can move my g/f to Vegas from Minnesota before we do anything like that .
Yeah , it makes sense in your situation .
I live in a three bedroom house .
It 's small , but for me , it makes more sense than renting because I 've got a steady job where I 'll likely be employed for a while .
I got my house from a guy who used to be a stock broker , then retired from that and started a non @-@ profit to build affordable houses .
I was making $ 33 k / yr at that time .
He advised me to buy a house because he thinks that inflation is going to start hitting .
I 've got a fixed rate mortgage that got bought by Bank of America ( gag ) so hopefully I 'm set .
I LOVE Jerry Doyle .
The comparison between him and the other 3 guys on the KDWN regular lineup ( Levin , Savage , Beck ) are AMAZING .
I have recommended him to even liberals who just want a different outlook .
He has such an intellectual explanation of everything and I am SO glad that he is a local .
I 'd love to meet him and shake his hand for at least TRYING to give an explanation for many of the outlandish remarks , and at many points refuting the more extreme views of the TP .
If you get a chance , you should listen to Dennis Praeger .
When I worked security to put myself through college , I got a chance to listen to his show and I really liked it .
If you have a sarcastic sense of humor you should listen to Suits .
Thanks Panzer .
This was why I felt like leaving CF for a while .
I felt like it was getting too personal with me and other people , and I have conservative friends on here I do respect and wish I could get to know .
A lot of people here seem extremely nice and maybe if we had talked about lighter stuff more and a lot of this stuff less , we would n't have so many issues with "@ Liberals are blah blah blah @" or "@ Conservatives are blah blah blah . @"
Liberals are wrong .
I like the no A/C idea though .
One tries .
Certainly there must be a few dissidents here or there , but the majority really do believe everything they are taught .
There is no reason for them not to .
From birth they are conditioned and never hear an alternate version of anything .
Very successful indoctrination .
That indoctrination of the Juche philosophy manifests the isolation and paranoia .
It 's a philosophy of self reliance .
One of their favorite mottos is "@ We have nothing to envy @" .
They believe they are the pure race .
The people think South Korea is a hell hole and that the North is a heaven .
It 's not as if these people know they are being suppressed or know that it is wrong ( besides those in the slave camps perhaps ) .
Through their propaganda they wake up each morning thinking "@ today is when the US attacks @" .
They delude themselves into thinking the suppression is simply "@ what needs to be done @" in order to defend themselves .
Despite this brainwash the North Koreans as a people are extremely humble and pleasant .
When I was visiting I was told at all times what to do .
I could not leave my guides side .
He told me who to talk to , what to eat , where to sleep , what to take photos of .
However I did get to talk to quite a few people in impromptu settings .
They are very curious about me and the world , but nothing will stray them from their brainwash .
No no way did I try to argue with them , it would be a waste and very very rude .
A few times I tried to tell them I was American ( i figured out the Korean word ) and some of the facial expressions were great , most did n't believe me .
Thought I was British .
It was a completely bizarre but fascinating place that is very misunderstood ( not to say nothing is wrong ) .
Here are my public photos if you are interested .
I even met with a 4 star General at the DMZ !
We talked and he mentioned he wanted peace with the US .
haha go figure !

wow , what a trip !
Is n't that the issue lisab pointed out ?
It does n't take a lot of effort to plan a tour that will only show you the rich / patriotic parts of the country .
Of course , they showed me what they wanted me to see , no doubt about that .
In my mind I often "@ joked @" about what was on the other side of that hill .
However Pyongyang and the other few cities I visited are quite large and you can n't stage everything .
Awesome pictures , Greg .
I 'm speechless at the guts that it took to go there .
I hope they finished his pyramid in time .
Actually , I 'd heard a while ago that they ( in partnership with telecom giant Orascom ) has resumed work on the Ryugyong Hotel and had at least finished the exterior cladding @:

I forgot about that one .
They did n't finish it in time after all .
Kim Jong Il was the front man for the military dictorship that runs North Korea .
He had power but others have power too .
Given N.K is so secretive it difficult know anything about the place for certain so what does all this mean -@ who knows .
Any thinking on this is pure speculation .
Time will tell what will happen , the one thing we know for sure societies change when we least expect them to .
so did you buy the seal penis liquor ?

I hope they meant 36 kinds of seal penis !
It taste fine , like a funky whiskey .
All my aliments were cured , so it was worth it !
The monks was from a Buddhist monastery .
Go figure !
I think he was the only one there , or at least the only one I saw .
Thanks , but actually as a tourist it 's one of the safest places you can ever be ( in terms of crime ) .
As long as you follow an extensive rule list , ok with faking respect and having no freedom , it 's not half bad !
not sure i could drink pickled pickles
maybe the leader worship is some kind of buddism spin , not that different from the tibetan llama in theory , if not practice .
Hard drugs is a political not a medical term .
Did cannabis suddenly become more dangerous when it was upgraded from class c to class B ?
Yes it did become more dangerous .
Nationally , skunk smokers are ending up ill in hospital in record numbers , with admissions soaring 73 per cent .
The number of adults recorded as suffering mental illness as a result of cannabis use has risen sharply from 430 in 1996 to 743 in 2006 .
The government data shows how the damaging effects of the drug have swept across England .
Hospital hotspots for cannabis abuse include Manchester , London , Cheshire and Merseyside .
And , as the debate over the drug 's dangers continues , figures released by the National Treatment Agency for Substance Abuse ( NTA ) show that more than 24,500 people are in drug treatment programmes for cannabis – the highest ever .
<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/mental-illness-soars-in-uks-skunk-hotspots-397449.html"> http://www.independent.co.uk/life-st...ts-397449.html </a>
Why is MDMA class A when it is safer than horse riding ?
Because the criteria for classification as a Class A drug have less to do with death rates and more to do with the fact that when it was classified as Class A , it had no medicinal use and was believed to be a hallucinogen like LSD .
Yes I am serious .
Both are addictive ,
Like a BB air @-@ gun and a 38 calibre pistol are both lethal weapons .
a social worker for a Delaware child @-@ welfare agency
yeah , it might be newsworthy .
Because the criteria for classification as a Class A drug have less to do with death rates and more to do with the fact that when it was classified as Class A , it had no medicinal use and was believed to be a hallucinogen like LSD . Why is MDMA class A when it is safer than horse riding ?
And its fairly commonly used as a date rape drug .
You can list the traits , but just because they share the traits , that does n't mean they share them equally .
That 's a pretty basic logical fallacy that would allow you to throw sugar and chocolate into the same category !
The level of addictiveness , level of mood alteration , and level of damage are just not comparable .
In particular , alcohol is not inherrently chemically addictive .
Certain people are succeptible to alcohol addiction via genetic defect , but that disease does not affect a large part of the population ( 9 % according to the wiki ) .
That is stakly different from hard drugs ( or even nicotine or caffiene , for that matter ) , which can cause chemical addiction in virtually everyone who uses them .
Alcohol also has a safe dosage , so use does not automatically imply misuse or any negative consequences at all .
Hard drugs do not have dosage levels where they have limited physiological effects ( that , of course , would defeat the purpose for taking them ) .
It helps to point out the logical flaw and rediculousness of the claim to push it to it 's logical extent .
You are the one who is broadening the definitions and criteria to the point of uselessness in order to include alcohol in the same category as hard drugs .
By broadening it further , chemisttree emphasizes the logical flaw and forces you to ( traps you into ) address [ ing ] it .
Ie , now that you acknowledge that broadening the criteria too far results in rediculousness , you should make an attempt to justify why your broadening of the criteria does n't also result in rediculousness .
Wow only 9 % of the population is genetically predispositioned to becoming an alcoholic , I just checked the population of the U.S. and as of July 08 it was 303,524,640 and 9 % of that is a bit over 37 million , quite an insignificant number indeed .
One does not have to be an alcoholic to abuse alcohol unfortunately .
In Rapid City , SD they have arrested over 300 for DUI since the first of the year .
That is about 3 a day .
I am sure that many of them were not alcoholics but that makes little difference .
I spent 30 years in management and safety in the trucking industry and I cleaned up over 100 truck wrecks , 10 of them were fatals with a total of 14 fatalities .
Every one of those 10 fatals involved alcohol .
In one instance our driver was drunk in 7 it was drunk drivers hittng our trucks and in two instances it was people under the influence using our trucks as a means of suicide .
One by throwing himself under the wheels as the truck pulled away from a cafe and another where a young lady , under the influence , had a fight with her boyfriend , demanded that he stop and let her out .
When he did , she ran out into the freeway and stood in front of our truck .
Our driver tried to stop and tried to evade her but she moved back in front of the truck .
I doubt seriously that you can get the same results with coffee or chocolate .
Just a thought but if alcohol is not addictive , why did so many people risk fines and jail to drink it during prohibition when they could have just drank coffee or ate a Hershey Bar .
In my previous post I said the guy who hit and killed 2 people got 7 years , I was wrong he only got 4 .
I remember from working for the Salvation Army that alcohol is a hard drugs @...
when you are adicted to it .
However , recreational use is possible .
I love to watch football with some friends and some beers .
I wondered if I could enjoy the game if me and my friends would shoot up some heroin first .
The problem with hard drugs is that recreational usage is not really possible .
A serious alcohol adiction is right up there with other hard drugs .
San Francisco is proposing a law that will ban handguns for its residents excluding , of course , the police , military , security and other jobs that require one to own a handgun .
I can find no reason for anyone to have a handgun at home or even carry one around .
I know this is a hot topic , but thought it would be interesting to see what others @' opinions are on the subject .
For the general public @: · Do you think people should own guns ?
Do you think people need to own guns ?
Do you think current gun control laws ( Federal ) are a true form of control ?
-- okay obviously I have a bias based on how the question is posed .
Banning hand guns just gives criminals more advantage than they already have .
I own several guns .
I can tell you that since I have owned a handgun I have realized how easy it is to carry one concealed .
If criminals knew that most people would cease to carry because it is illegal then does n't that give them advantages ?
The way it is now you NEVER KNOW who is carrying .
Does n't this give the general public an advantage because it is less likely a criminal will try to pull something knowing that he could get a shell in the back of his head because someone could have a gun ?
Do you really think gun laws will keep criminals from getting guns ?
There are alot more uses for guns than shooting people .
If shooting people is the only reason you can think of then YOU are the cold blooded one , not the honest people who choose to own guns and use them responsibly and in some cases actually wear them out .
You act as if every gun ever sold has an owner who is just waiting to use it in a murder .
I will also tell you that if guns are banned information will pop up everywhere on how to make your own gun .
It 's really not that hard to make one with some basic metalworking equipment .
Guns are too much part of society in the U.S. to change the way people feel about them .
To be fair , I should have added a fifth poll choice -- Current Gun Laws need to be revised -- as it is the poll does not consider many aspects of the current gun laws that I find disturbing .
For instance , the law requires one to registered and be licensed to own a gun , yet there are no provisions requiring gun owners to update their license when they move or sell their gun .
This is a huge loop hole within gun control in my opinion .
Another problem is that the turn @-@ around for background checks is only 24 hours -- is that really sufficient time ?
With such a powerful item , I think more time should be required .
Plus state to state laws differ greatly and I find all sorts of possible dangers that allow criminals to acquire guns too easily .
I do n't want to "@ send @" my kids to school anyway , but that 's irrelevant .
Yeah , I would prefer to have my kids in a school where somebody could do something if the school was being taken over .
In some places STUDENTS can bring GUNS to school ( rifle clubs ) .
Certainly , but only if you use it incorrectly .
Certainly , but again , only if you use these things in ways that were not intended .
The spread pattern makes it easier to hit what you are aiming at .
The same goes for the fact that its large and has a stock - I do n't know if you 're a shooter , but for an unskilled shooter , a handgun is extremely difficult to aim .
Shotguns also have "@ stopping power . @"
I 'm not suggesting everyone will be able to go buy a handgun and shoot burglars in the head with 100 % accuracy , but that 's what shooting ranges are for .
If you can n't aim a pistol , stay away from them .
I 've shot them before and did n't find them particularly difficult .
Whoa now - "@ more sophisticated than their military @" ?
You 're suggesting civilians should be allowed to own machine guns , tanks , and rocket launchers ?
If you check England 's murder rate , you 'll find it does not support your assertion .
Said in 1795 or thereabouts , when the most powerful / sophisticated weapons that existed were a muzzle @-@ loaded bal @-@ shot musket and a cannon .
Clearly , this provision of the 2 nd amendment ( and the general principle being discussed here of defense against your government ) is long obsolete .
Sure .
A few tanks and assualt weapons in the right civilian hands in North Korea could change the country into something better almost immediately .
Or do you want the defenseless starving civilians to keep dying ?
Nevertheless , apart from its Soviet @-@ supplied nuclear and missile technologies , North Korea is one of the weakest nations in the world .
It is economically moribund , devastated by the collectivist scourge .
Experts estimate that from one to two million people have died of starvation since 1990 , out of a population of twenty @-@ two million .
Flocks of orphaned children search amid the refuse for scraps of food .
In one decade , life expectancy declined by six years .
And this while the country was receiving generous aid @: by May of 2001 , Washington had delivered 100,000 metric tons of food and the E.U. had spent 200 million euros on relief .
But again we see what little likelihood there is of aid actualy getting to populations in need .
There is every reason to think that these donations have served instead to boost the regime 's military arsenal @: in 1994 , at the height of the famine , North Korea purchased forty submarines from Russia .
The military is so ridiculously powerful compared to the ordinary citizen that nothing is going to happen until weapons of war are captured for a revolt , or a country declares war on North Korea .
I gave it as an example which is what the poster asked .
I 'm not the one who picked it apart .
Your smart a$$ attitude is not helping your cause .
So give me a better example then @...
or even harder @...
try to give me a good example not based on "@ fear @" .
Yes .
Think you got what I ment anyway .
Ok , I would be a lot more frightened by the thought of that guns ending up in some kids hands @...
Oh , this is cute .
They just had to overturn an election in Lee County ( the South Carolina county where the sheriff just got busted for his involvement in the drug business ) because they got 107 % turnout .
See what happens when you have a Democrat president ?
-@ Joe
The simplest record method is that you get a printed receipt that you can verify matches your intended vote , but without your name on it .
Then you drop that receipt into a box before leaving the polling place .
This would be just like the manual voting cards we used prior to the machines .
If there is any funky number business , then the receipts can be counted by hand .
That 's a manual recount .
If you really want to have fun , print the receipts as scantron forms .
Then there is a recountable record that does not have the voter 's ID associated , but the voter checks before submitting , that is independent of the electronic record in the machines and any code finagling and whatnot .
I like this idea .
That sounds really good
I do n't think we can rely on voting machines when they have no way to verify the count .
The head of Diebold said his mission was to see that Bush was re @-@ elected .
He did not say he wanted to have a great working machine .
What does it take for us to shit can them ?
Diebold no longer makes voting machines .
That part of its business was spun off into a separate company called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Election_Solutions"> Premier Election Solutions </a> in 2007 , and that in turn was bought another company called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Systems_%26_Software"> Election Systems & Software </a> in 2009 .
So you do n't have to be scared of the Diebold boogeyman anymore .

It was taken during the attack in Lahore against the Sri Lankan Cricket Team in February 2009 , now see the pictures below , taken during the Mumbai attacks November 2008 , the same two terrorists were photographed at both events !
A saffron red thread called a tilak , worn around the wrist is considered to have deep religious significance among Hindus , that 's the red bit around his right wrist .
So on the one hand since one was wearing a Hindu tilak , it appears certain that the Mumbai attackers were in no way connected to Pakistan at all .
On the other , there are reports that at least some of the attackers had stayed at Nariman House , which is an exclusively Jewish hostel in Mumbai prior , which opens up a whole new can of worms so to speak .

january 10 , 2011 mr delay was sentenced to three years in prison .
On October 3 , 2005 , a Travis County , Texas , Grand Jury indicted Tom DeLay on a felony conspiracy charge to move $ 190,000 in corporate donations to Republican candidates in the Texas State Legislature in 2002 .
On October 20 , 2005 , Tom DeLay turned himself in to the Harris County Sheriff Office , the day after an arrest warrant was issued .
He was released after posting a $ 10,000 bond .
On November 24 , 2010 , DeLay was found guilty by a jury in Austin ( Travis County ) , Texas , of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering .
He was subsequently sentenced to three years in prison and 10 years probation on January 10 , 2011 .
DeLay 's lead attorney has said that he will appeal the convictions .
As a convicted felon Delay would never again be eligible to run for public office in Texas nor would he be able to vote in Texas until he completes any sentence , including probation and parole .
As of January 11 , 2011 , Delay is out on bail pending his appeal .

by Marguerite Reardon March 6 , 2013 9 @:@ 31 AM PST
The Department of Justice seems to be giving the green light to T-Mobile USA in its bid to buy MetroPCS .
Today , MetroPCS announced that the DOJ has allowed the waiting period to lapse on the planned merger between the two companies .
The waiting period was required under the Hart @-@ Scott @-@ Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 .
This indicates that the DOJ does n't have any objections to the merger .
There are still other regulatory approvals the companies must get in order to close the deal .
The Federal Communications Commission must approve the transfer of spectrum licenses .
There has been some opposition to the merger , including some pushback from labor unions that contend the merger will put jobs in jeopardy .
After stating that the merger would create jobs , T-Mobile and MetroPCS recently filed a statement with the FCC admitting that there would be job losses .
But the companies said the job losses would be minimal .
The companies also need approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment , since T-Mobile is a wholly owned subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom , a German telecommunications company .

n48hy7 · A protester with the organization Meu Rio in January in Ipanema .
( Felipe Dana / AP )
RIO DE JANEIRO – Tall and tan and young and lovely , the girl from Ipanema goes … “@ Ew , what ’s that smell ? @”
At Ipanema beach in January , the organization Meu Rio staged a protest in an attempt to make it known that thousands of gallons of raw sewage are dumped into the ocean off Rio ’s coast each day .
“@ For three months we held protests every weekend to turn an invisible problem into a visible one , @” Leona Deckelbaum , the campaign coordinator with Meu Rio , said in a recent interview .
Only about 34 percent of Rio ’s sewage is treated , and the rest simply washes into the azure waters , giving new meaning to the nautical term poop deck .
Guanabara Bay , the site of several 2016 Olympic sailing events , has 78 times Brazil ’s legally allowed limit of fecal pollution , and 195 times the U.S. limit .
In addition to human waste , the bay is also a receptacle for trash from ships and the bay 's 15 adjacent communities , as well as toxic runoff from a former landfill .
And its not just Guanabara @–@ the ritzy Leblon and Ipanema beach areas are plagued with similar pollution problems .
The state environmental agency , INEA , found that Leblon and Ipanema were unfit for swimming for 40 percent of 2011 .
Botafogo Beach had so much fecal pollution that it did not pass a single INEA test in 2013 , according to the BBC .
1 . After Beijing , nobody cares
2 . Not just sailing events ; open @-@ water distance swimming and triathlon events are also affected by this .

My wife had a minor scrape in a car park and the net result was a couple of scratches on both cars .
She was at fault and asked the other driver to contact us so we make the situation good .
Our garage reckoned our damage would cost £ 50 and his was less extensive !
We heard nothing and then got a letter from the insurance company saying he had submitted a claim .
My wife texted him and he said "@ tough - I 'm getting a nice new bumper and the loss of your NCD will pay for it @" .
Or slightly blunter words to that effect .
Assuming he is correct do we have any rights to challenge the insurance company 's assessment who seem to have inflated the claim at the expense of our NCD !
Malc
Not really .
It 's up to your insurers to decide how they want to settle a claim .
hello ,
just looking for some more advice on my situation .
I was recently made redundant a week after announcing my pregnancy .
After receiving legal advice I have been advised to send a letter to my employer highlighting that I wish to appeal their decision .
Does anyone have any idea where I can find a template letter to follow and also whether the fact I was a temporary employer matters when it comes to appealing a decision .
Many Thanks
Do n't order anything online if Amtrak are delivering it - here 's my experience .
Ordered a 32 @" TV online , cheaper than Argos - who did n't have it in stock - but with the delivery charge the cost was the same .
Advised that it would be delivered by Amtrak on Tuesday .
Tuesday came and went , no sign .
Phoned Amtrak on Wednesday , "@ we need a consignment number @" .
Phoned online company and got it .
Phoned Amtrak "@ a card was left on Tuesday as you were n't there @" ( no it was n't of course ) , and "@ we 're not allowed to leave it with a neighbour @" .
Arranged for another delivery on Saturday .
Arrived home yesterday - it had been delivered next door yesterday , with a card saying this was their first attempt at delivery @...
What a bunch of jokers .
My friend was scammed this christmas and I would n't want anyone else to fall prey to these bar*****s
He answered one of those russian wife emails which are going around at the moment .
When she replied she seemed nice and the photo given was a gorgous young lady .
Ater a few exchanges of emails my friend decided he wanted to meet however there was a catch .
She had no money for the flight .
It would cost £ 450 + £ 50 transfer by western union .
Anyway blinded by love or lust he sent the money .
Unfortunately that was not the last he heard from her because she said she will come over christmas .
My friend embarked on a shopping spree .
Pressies and doing up the bedroom to make it their love nest .
He then got an email saying she needed to prove to immigration that she could support herself .
She needed $ 1500 or £ 900 .
He was dubious but checked with a someone eastern european he was acquainted with , who convinced him it was possible .
Anyway he promptly wired the money over to her .
The day before she was supposed to arrive she got an email .
It said she was on the train after visiting the bank when she was mugged .
She needed more money .
By this time my friend was desperate to meet her .
Without a thought he paid her .
I think you can guess what happened .
Did she show up for Christmas ??
My friend is one of the nicest guys you can meet .
He has been unlucky in love and has 2 small children .
Although sex was probably at the front of his mind I think he genuinely was looking for a companion .
He has learnt a valuable less extremely expensively
Too late now , but another variant on advance fee fraud ( google for this and / or 419 scam ) .
Most of them hit one or more of the 7 deadly sins , and there are that many photo 's and documents available on t'web these days .
He 's far from being the only one by the way - these scams rake in several BILLION each year .
This is the classic foreighn bride scam - your friend was probably not even communicating with a women at all .
Golden Rule is never to send money topeople you do n't know and have never met .
Remember , Mishka on Neighbours turned up and was a very amazing Russian bride .
I 'm sure there are good offers out there .
im sorry but i have no sympathy at all for him .
surely he has read and heard these stories before .
how many times did he send money ???
id have understood a tad if only once but 3 times , come on , get a grip .
These scams happen because people are stupid enough to believe them .
do n't tell me when you first read the post you first thought was n't "@ he has n't really fallen for that @"
tut tut tut , maybe next time he will learn when he gets an email saying he 's won the spanish lottery , all he needs to do is send 1000 to release the money !!!!
LOL
There is no way a Russian women can get a VISA to visit the UK on her own simply as a tourist - she would need a UK sponsor , and the VISA would be a fiancee VISA , not a tourist VISA .
Someone posted a story very similar to this on the moneysaving marriages forum over xmas .
It involved her Dad .
Similar thing , she was mugged etc. and he had to send more money , but this one did turn up over here .
Ill see if I can find the thread .

You need to check that .
It actually depends on the status of the lady in her own country , but yes she would still need a sponsor .
MY sons girlfriend is Thai , she qualifies in her own right for a tourist visa and does n't need a fianc !
visa .
Fianc !
visa means you have to marry in 60 or 90 days a tourist visa gives you 6 - 12 months in the UK This scam used to be the the Thai lady British passport scam .
The bit where this is hard to believe is where you say he "@ checked with someone Eastern european he was aquainted with @" .Er @..
did he not run this by anyone else @..
cos would n't 99 % have said nooooo @..
Is anyone else always suspicious of posts which involve much foolishness supposedly happening to '@ a friend @' .
Do n't get me wrong - I do feel sorry for the person it happened to - if only for the obvious loneliness which drove a man to the point where all reason flies out of the window but was n't it a wise woman ( or man ) who said that God gave Man a brain and a p***s but not enough blood to run both of them at the same time !!!!
Sorry could n't resist that - I 'll understand if it gets moderated .

ha ha ha .
do n't know about cliff , thought he was indestructible ?
not like Jimmy Saville who croaked yesterday .
RIP jim .
haha , I do n't wish cliff any ill health TBH he comes across as quit a nice bloke , BUT i wish he would call it a day with the singing and take up train spotting or something .
Ooh you had me all worried there !
Cliff 's got many more years in him yet !
You had me for a second
Well these celebrities seem to die in threes @...
who are the next two ?
That is THE way to get peoples attention
Ive met him and hes very nice in person he asked my sister to go to a party and had a slightly rusty rolls royce
there was an accident in town with a catbacker bus ( KSU fans ) that went under a bridge that connected dorms @.......
some people were on the very top of the bus ( which they should n't be , while the vehicle is moving ) , anyways , one person had what the paper called "@ a head injury @" which was decapitation
and the other was in critical condition @......
thats a real downer @......
especially after your team loses , then you lose your head
that is really unfortunate .
Decapitation can ruin your whole day .
i 've never had a fatal accident but they do n't sound good
If you ever have one be sure to post about it here !
I know a guy , who knows a guy who got decapitated once @....
he has n't been right since @...
Some folks just lose their heads over decapitation .
my grandfather 's second wife was decapitated .
he was cleared of all charges .
I had a friend that i worked with many years ago .
He was decapatated after his mini truck went under a diesel .
Poor guy .
They said he did n't feel any pain .
and needless to say , there was no open casket .
My boyfriend does graphics for Barry Cooper ( the ex @-@ DEA cop who now makes documentaries based around marijuana @-@ Never Get Busted and Never Get Raided ) and we met him for the first time at the premiere public screening of Never Get Raided this past Saturday in Dallas .
Ever since then , I 've been drooling like a rabid squirrel .
I 've suddenly become infatuated with this guy .
But I feel so good @...
like a kid again with a silly crush and fantasy .
Of course , nothing will ever come from these crazy feelings , he 's 17 years my senior and married to his soulmate and I 'm in love with my boyfriend .
It 's just wild , but maybe I 'm just star @-@ struck .
He 's the closest thing to a celebrity that I 've ever known .
He 's been on 20 / 20 , MSNBC , CNN , Geraldo @...
not necessarily famous , but getting there .
But good god the things I would do to that man if all of the situations I just listed off were n't so .
Haha .
So good thing you were not left alone in the limo , lol I could see the headlines now .
I choose the right girls , but can n't commit 2 them , and choose the wrong guys , for example , my first true love cheated on me several times , my next realtionship i got engaged and he hit me , and the 3 rd guy , well thts unspeakable of what he did to me at night time @...
but yeah thats my true confessions , i can n't stay single and attract the wrong guys .

I have a favour to ask on behalf of <a href="http://hipforums.com/forums/member.php?u=4986"> smartie.uk </a> who 's currently in Angouleme on the first part of his travels through Europe .
He 's staying in a hostel and will be heading southwards on Tuesday ( December 7 ) , heading roughly in the direction of Spain across the Pyrennees .
He just texted me to ask if any of you French hipforumers are in the area and would be kind enough to give him a lift southwards ?
If anyone is willing to help out a fellow hipforumer please get in touch !
Thankyou kindly !
i am nomadic by nature .
i can n't stay in one place for more than a couple months .
i just can n't .
ever since i was old enough to figure out how to use public transportation by myself , i 've been taking off on whim to wherever .
and i have had legal troubles for the past four years .
before , i was under 18 , so the cops kept bringing me back to my parents .
and then i got arrested when i was 19 , and every time i stay put somewhere for too long , i get arrested again .
my only crime EVER has been possession .
and i have three felonies and too many misdemeanors to count .
i am bad at being a "@ criminal @" i guess .
anarchist pheramones is all that i can think of to account for how i get caught so much .
all i do is possess drugs !
i do n't steal or bother anybody .
anyway , i recently got out of prison .
( the worst part about going to prison was that they made me comb out my dreads to make sure i was n't smuggling something in in them .
HA ! ) so anyway , I 'm on parole for a year .
and i have to be in illinois for a year to complete parole .
and i already bought a greyhound ticket to california .
but I 'm trying to make myself stay here to complete parole .
because parole is easy .
all i have to do is call them from a land line every week .
and if I 'm in another state , and a cop runs my name , it will show up that I 'm on parole , so i 'll violate and get sent back to prison .
i 've already been extradited twice .
it sucks .
so i wanna make myself stay here all year .
it seems impossible .
how do people do it ?
even if i had a place in my name , it would be easy for me to just leave it to go somewhere for a while .
because the same places get boring , and i need to travel .
it 's in my blood .
but if i complete parole , i might finally be free to travel without being a fugitive , and then i can just become transient indefinitly , and that 's my dream .
advice ?
Hi , This is what you get for speeding .
A spanking .
Police sued over alleged paddling of teen for speeding ticket .
I think the police went overboard with the spanking of this 16 year old .
What do you think of this ?
<a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/a/2004/03/31/national1238EST0613.DTL"> http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cg...238EST0613.DTL </a>
Thanks , Robert .
I would like to see a little background on the cop and the boy .
The story seems strangly one sided .
It seems like the whole thing is fdrom Mommy 's POV .
I think she may have just seen a cool opportunity to make a quick 200 grand .
On the other hand @...
what kind of police dept does this place have ?
I would have felt a little strange dishing out that punishment .
Sounds like we have a cop who likes to spank teenaged boys .
muzikdude , I 'm with you on feeling weird about the cop .
I suspect the cop is enjoying the spanking .
yeah somethings fishy because fines for speeding tickets are a source of revenue for the town .
why 'd they give that away and tie up a cops hours in one shot is stupid
Yeah , anybody else catch the pants @-@ down aspect ?
This was a sexual assault .
That is crazy @..
Ewww @...
I 'm against corporal punishment in general , but this was rather disturbing .
First off a 16 year old is more adult than child .
Second , there is nothing sexual about paddling a bare bottom unless your into that sort of thing .
It was a stupid idea , from a small town cop .
Can n't say I 'm amazed , disturbed or even surprised .
Heck yeah !
I think it is hilarious and they should take up the policy .
Most kids my age are brash and arrogant and could probably use a paddling .
Yeah , at first glance I found the idea to be quite funny .
Then I read the article and the mother saying her son , no wait child , was "@ tramatized @" .
Yeah , then they called the 16 guy a "@ child @" .
Hmm , lets see @: consider myself a man , 2 year age difference , *@ thinks @* @....
Aha !
I have it !
The guy really is a child becuase he was "@ tramatized @" over a paddling .
What I find interesting is that the 16 year old allowed the cop to paddle him , not once , but three times .
I 'm sorry , but this is both funny and sick at the same time .
The mother probably agreed so that whatever the child had done would '@ go away @' and their insurance would n't get higher .
The guy , or '@ child @' , probably did n't want to pay the ticket and figured that the '@ paddling @' would be like the ones his mom / dad probably gave him as a younger child .
Lets face it , parents do n't enjoy spanking their kids , as it causes them pain .
I know for a FACT that my mom and dad did n't give me a '@ thrashing @' as a kid , but I sure did n't want to curse again after getting spanked for saying the word for a person with no father .
The Police is honestly probably a very sick person .
Not once have I EVER heard of a cop giving the people a '@ choice @' in their ticketing .
He probably saw this as a way to get some of his rocks off , and took the risk .
Now he 's gotten introuble for it , and I hope that if his intentions were what I think they were , he gets fired .
There is no need for spanking a 16 year old , let alone even THINKING of trying to do so bare bottom .
~@ shakes his head @~
If I was this kid , I would never have agreed to it .
Think of the humiliation this boy is going to have have to face in school .
~@ sigh @~ .
people always make things harder for themselves .
Just pay the ticket and get over it .
*@ chuckles @* Auto filter at my board changes that to '@ person of illegitimate parentage @' .
I do n't know if the police wanted to do this to '@ get his rocks off @' , but I do know that it was inapropriete .
However , I think just about everyone went into fault here @: the teenager twice ( for speeding AND for agreeing to an alternative punnishment he must have known was illegal ) , the mother for agreeing to something like this and then sueing over it , and the chief of police for making up such a sick '@ program @' in the first place .
Should the mother sue to get the police chief removed @: yes , of course that man should be removed .
Should she get even one dollar ?
NO !!
She decided to agree when she heard of a program for her 16 year old son that included 15 paddling sessions ?
And then there were no alarmbells going off ?
But when he came out crying , there were ?
I 'm sorry @...
but no .
Perhaps a social worker should be assigned to them to see what parenting values there are in that family , and to give them some good advice .

We told some friends last night , but I only told my auntie about this , no one in our family knows at all .
I 'm very nervous / scared to live in Florida , seeing that I lived in Connecticut all my life until September of this year when I moved to Massachusetts .
His mom is probably not going to take it too well if we decide to go to Florida , she 's already pretty upset that his other 2 brother already been living in New Hampshire with their wives for sometime now , and she thought her youngest was going to stay closeby in Massachusetts .

We just got to finish paying off his debt , and go from there @...
I pray that the Lord will guide us in the right direction .

The "@ punishment @" of Fayhan al Ghamdi for viciously beating , raping and burning his innocent 5 year old daughter who this sick and twisted man suspected of not being a virgin @...
a fifty thousand dollar fine and time served @...
is an offense to God and every decent human being alike .
It is also an extreme hypocrisy that in Saudi Arabia , a man can not be executed for killing his children or wife , but can face the death penalty for leaving Islam and becoming a Christian ( or a member of any other religion ) .
The World Muslim Congress came out with a statement decrying both the murder and the "@ punishment @" ( if it can be called that ) .
While I do not agree with them that the Quran is God 's word or that Muhammad is his prophet , everything else they said regarding the case is dead @-@ on , in my opinion .
I agree with them that capital punishment is wrong , albeit not only for the reasons they gave ( which I think are good ones ) but also because God clearly said in the Bible that those who do not show mercy will not be shown mercy by God .
The Saudi rapist Fayhan al @-@ Ghamdi , got away with murder
The intention of Sharia law was to serve justice to the parties in conflict , it is human interpretation of God 's word to suit their era , it is not a divine law , neither is it God 's law as propagated .
However , it is the abuse in administering the Sharia law that is the problem .
Unfortunately , the Sharia law is so distorted that it sounds like a cruel system of law to a woman who gets thrown out on the whim of an idiot by calling Talaq three times , female rape victim , an apostate and the blasphemer .
Those men you have listed , "@ Imam Hanifa , Imam Shafi , Imam Hanbal , Imam Malik , Imam Ghazali or Imam Madoodi , @" were great men with a few exceptions for their time .
They defined the Sharia in terms of the norms prevalent at that time .
With all due respect and honor for their work , they did not have the same environment as Prophet Muhammad did or we have , - of working with different tribes and faiths , and as a result their attitudes were "@ stick it to them @" .
This man , Fayhan al @-@ Ghamdi got away paying the blood money .
He should have been locked away , as they say in Urdu "@ Qaid ba @-@ mushaqqat @" prison with hard labor .
What prevents the SOB from repeating it ?
If he has the money to shell out again , he will do it again .
I n the US there are many incidents where a hard core criminal was let out on bail , and he would do go out and do the same .
I am personally against the state killing the criminal deliberately , it denies the criminal from living the life , and prevents him from repenting his mistake @....
and the blood money does not bring justice , compensation should be there to the victims , but that should be a part of whole punishment .
We can not trade life for money .
Only God 's word is beyond question , Prophet 's words , if genuine , would be unquestionable .
A lot has been dished out as Prophet 's word .
I come across so much non @-@ sense ascribed to him .
He was the ultimate peace maker and rightfully called Rahmatul Aalameen -@ the mercy to mankind .
Muslims do not uphold that title for him ; they are brutal towards those who convert from Islam to other faiths , or blasphemers .
Some Muslims are very insecure in their faith , they think that Prophet will disappear into thin air if someone criticizes him , or not defended .
Prophet Muhammad ( pbuh ) is beyond defending .
Some of the Imams did not have faith in the prophet and resorted to defending him , how wrong are they !
Be hopeful , things will change for better , the new generation will restore common sense to the religion which is about fairness , justness and respect for God 's creation .
Islam is about freedom and not compulsion .

I know I may be stepping into a minefield here but I have to ask this .
I was listening to NPR on the way to work today and one of their reporters was at a celebration that Huckabee held after winning in Iowa .
The reporter was clearly next to a female who was praying in a loud , almost ranting type of way , asking God to lift up Mike Huckabee , etc. etc. and asking God to make sure that Huckabee is proud of being a pastor and how we are to select leaders who are spiritual , etc. I would have given anything to see a videotape of it
The press can do a remarkable job of taking even the most innocuous instance and sometimes just by broadcasting it , make it look really bad .
This was one of those cases .
I asked some fellow Christians about a thesis that was forming in my mind about the possibility of Huckabee being elected .
I specifically asked if we , as Christians , have become so pious that we believe that the only person who can lead this country is an ordained Baptist minister .
I mean , think about that for a second .
The field is wide open , yet why is it that the Christians pile on Mike Huckabee 's wagon and openly snub other people , like Mitt Romney ?
It would be wrong of us to issue a call to Mitt Romney to be the pastor of First Baptist church .
Clearly he does not share our doctrine .
But does that mean that we should n't support him ?
Or what about Giuliani ?
He has been married and divorced several times .
But I would remind folks that the divorce rate is the same for those of us who are "@ churched @" and those who are unchurched .
Yet it seems like we judge him on his divorces .
Does anybody really believe that if Giuliani gets elected that his wife is going to divorce the powerful person in the country while he is in office ?
Not a chance .
Giuliani 's marriage is not going to end in divorce ( hopefully ever ) but especially not if he gets elected .
Bottom line ?
There is no way that a if a republican gets elected that they will go act in a manner contrary to conservative opinions on abortion , gay marriage , etc. And by the way , there are bigger issues than those .
To do so would be the death knell of the republicans .
I 'm not saying that I endorse any of these candidates .
But I do believe that we should n't jump on Huckabee 's wagon just because he is a pastor .
So if what I said is true about what a republican president will not do , then why the support for Huckabee ?
Are some of us naive ?
Am I the only one who feels that he is using Jesus as a prop in the election ( think of his Christmas day ad if you disagree ) .
I would sooner walk across hot coals than attend a Huckabee rally and rant and cheer when he speaks of values .
Same thing goes for most rallies by most of today 's presidential candidates .
They are using us as props and we need to be resistant of that .
To put it another way , if you had attended a rally for George W Bush back in 2000 , would you dare tell anyone now that you were there back then ?
Probably not .
And for the young lady who was probably miked for her prayer , I would respectfully ask that she keep it down .
Showboating like that , I believe , only pushes us backward in our ability to spread the Gospel and bring more people to Christ .
Wait , what exactly is your question ?
Are people naive ?
Oohhhhhh yeah .
But maybe that is n't your question .
My question is why are people jumping on Huckabee 's bandwagon .
The rest of it was food for thought .
Maybe they found someone they can identify with that is in the race that is n't a slick New England republican @-@ poser politician or a beltway insider or a fringe nutjob @...
Maybe you are right .
My concern is the inordinate level of support he is drawing from Christian evangelicals .
He does not have the broad support that Obama has .
With Huck , it is very concentrated .
It 's an election , people vote for they believe is the right guy ( or gal ) @...
he reflects evangelical beliefs , by and large the others are snakey , so who do ya think they 're gonna vote for ?
More politicians than not are like that .
But they are going for him without so much as a glance at his record .
Look at all the people he paroled while in Arkansas .
I heard it was half the state .
Okay , I 'm kidding .
The guy does n't have that great of a record .
Just because he shares our beliefs does n't entitle him to the presidency .
Separation of church and state exists for a reason and do n't think for a second that if he gets in that the lines will n't become dangerously blurred .
And although I have n't finished it , I can say it is a decent book .
Fast Paced .
Great Plot .
But anyone who buys the theories and "@ history @" of this book needs to do some reading that does n't come from the section in a Grocery store line next to the M& Ms.
You are a crack up !
I have n't read it yet - we keep meaning to .
Kinda seems important to have a bit of a feel of things hey .
I liked it too , the writing was n't great but it was a good read .
I agree about the theories and history too !
It 's straight out of "@ Holy blood , Holy Grail @" , did anyone ever read that book ?
I have n't .
But I heard the authors sued him over it in England .
I 'm reading it now .
I 'm a fan of alternative histories , and this is among the oldest ones in the Christian tradition .
To be quite truthful its been around far longer than "@ Holy Blood , Holy Grail . @"
In fact Merovich claimed to be descended from Christ according to more than one account .
The history of it is utter hogwash ( the canon was n't even voted on at Nicea ) .
However it is a good plot and a fastpaced read .
I 'm severely dyslexic and made it through it in under a week .
Joe Zollars
I enjoyed it ' t'was very readable , and a good work of fiction .
I just wish more people would realise that that 's what it is .
If we do n't know the history of our faith , we are liable to believe anything someone tells about it as history .
Fortunately , most of us probably know enough about our faith not to fall here .
Unfortunately not every Christian Does @....
That is what is concerning .
I 've got a copy around somewhere , but have n't got around to reading it .
It 's more the atheists I 'm worried about @...
Atheiests think we are all suckers , so if we look overly paranoid about some popular book or movie - it will confirm their suspicions .
indeed so Gtsecc .
I would add that it is important that we do read the book , and if we can n't do that at least watch the movie ( it really is a much better book ) .
How can we answer sincere question about the faith when we do n't even know the questions ?
Joe Zollars
After you finish it , I suggest you get "@ Angels and Demons @" next .
You will probably find , like many of us that have read both books , that A&D is actually the better of the two .
Part of the reason I am reading it .
You hit the nail on the head .
I just might , I am thoroughly enjoying The code .
What about his book about the digital hacking ?
I think it was written before A&D .
indeed so !
Joe Zollars
umm well nto so good IMO .
Mr. Brown is most likely a two hit wonder .
Joe Zollars
I just finished it last night after I posted .
I just have one thing to say .
Wow , I did n't see that coming @.....
Really ?
Okay , I 'll steer clear of that one , but I 'll look at A&D .
Cola , now you see why it is sucha good book .
I guessed it like three chapters before they told you @--@ but still , that 's aways into the book .
He does at least know how to do suspense fiction .
Joe Zollars
That he does sir , that he does .
While we are on the topic of suspense novels , what else do you guys like ?
While not necessarily the same type of suspense , Jurrassic Park was awesome .
The movie pales in comparison .
Most movies are weak compared to the book , but this moreso .
That brings up another topic , was the Da Vinci movie any good ?
I have n't seen it .
Actually , I liked "@ Digital Fortress @" .
I found it difficult to put down .
I also liked "@ Deception point @" .
So I have read all four of his books and enjoyed them .
Having read all four , I will admit that the only drawback to Brown 's style is that his books seem to have been written on a template .
They all follow the same format .
You 'll understand what I mean after you read 2 or 3 of them .
What makes a council ecumenical in the eyes of the Oriental Orthodox ?
Bishops all over the world meet together to deal with faith and pastoral problems .
Councils that are admitted by our church are @: 1 @- Council of Nicea @: ( 325 A.D. ) that dealt with Arius who denied Christ 's divinity .
2 @- Council of Constantinople @: ( 381 A.D. ) because of Machdonius who denied the divinity of the Holy Spirit .
3 @- Council of Ephesus @: ( 431 A.D. ) because of Nestorius who separated between Christ 's divinity and humanity .
Copts had an effective role in these councils .
also the council judgments must not conflict with the first church fathers teachings as " St. Athanasius & St. Cyril the Great "
Two things @:
1 . It conveys the right faith .
2 . Justly accepted by the Catholic Church , all who are of the same faith .
( that 's what seperates an "@ ecumenical @" council from a "@ local @" council that conveyes true faith ) .
We as OO 's used to think we were the Catholic Church , but today , the fourth and fifth councils held at Ephesus ( 449 and 475 ) are not considered ecumenical , since the EO counterparts also held Orthodox faith in their last four councils ( or six ) .
TECHNICALLY , we did have five "@ ecumenical councils , @" but in light of the present discussions , we agree to three @: Nicea , Constantinople , and Ephesus 431 .
God bless .
Mina
Two things @:
we mean by catholic the universal church not the Roman Catholic
Two things @:
I thought the point of an ecumenical council was to clarify essentialy there is a despute over the right faith and the council "@ decides @" what is .
How can this be a condition .
Indeed , councils come about because of disputes .
I never heard of a council convened for the sake of convening .
But you asked how do councils become "@ ecumenical . @"
God bless .
Mina
Well yes but My point is that if the right faith is in dispute before the council and in order for the council to be ecumenical it must convey the right faith then there is no point in having an ecumenical council because after the council one side will say that it did have the right faith and the other will say that it did n't and you will be right back where you began .
Oh and I have heard of local councils convening for the sake of convening .
And that 's why different denominations have different opinions on the numbers of ecumenical councils , and what they are .
UNLESS , you do not believe that you are the ONLY Church , of which outside Her there is no clear path of salvation .
In this case , any council after an "@ unnecessary @" schism is not "@ accepted by the Catholic Church @" ( in an ecumenical sense ) , and thus not "@ ecumenical . @"
For example , in light of today 's EO-OO discussions , any counci after · Ephesus 431 is not "@ ecumenical , @" but are considered no more than local councils that profess Orthodox faith .
What did you have in mind in the "@ qualifications @" of an ecumenical council ?
They 're very rare in ancient times .
God bless .
Mina
Sorry this took so long .
So what is an "@ unnecessary @" schism ?
I 'd say all schism regarding a division in Truth is necessary .
Well I mean that when a Catholic says ecumenical council they mean a council that was held in order to confront a dispute and then once it is over everyone should just except that as Truth .
( although obviously they do n't )
However in the Catholic Church we say it is ecumenical when the Pope says it 's ecumenical .
So I wondered what makes it ecumenical to an Orthodox person .
I had an Idea but it did n't really make any sense to me .
So I thought I 'd come here and ask .
But it seems we have a different Idea of an ecumenical council so I guess what to an OO person is an ecumenical council ?
An "@ unnecessary @" schism is a schism that occurred as a result of misunderstood intentions of faith , where in actuality , both parties of the schism profess the same Truth , i.e. a schism based on semantics .
I disagree .
A council does not define Truth , but should uphold that which was already true before .
If a council decreed that Arianism is correct , are we to say that Arianism , which used to be false , is all of a sudden true ?
There would be no point in calling St. Athanasius "@ contra mundum , @" but rather "@ contra truth . @"
First , we have to take about Papal beliefs .
The Pope is in no authority ALONE to say a council is ecumenical or not .
It is a gathering of world Patriarchs together that must profess truth based on the Holy Fathers and previous faith of other councils .
The Pope is not the Pope of the world , but only of Rome .
He locally effects Rome and its jurisdictions , and is not above other bishops of the world .
I think it 's more than just a difference in opinion on ecumenical councils .
We differ on Papal beliefs as well , which lead to differences in ecumenicity of councils .
God bless you .

Rockström said that when rich countries increase their consumption , they also accelerate the exploitation of the world 's national resources , with the result that they emit more greenhouse gases .
This will ultimately accelerate the speed of desertification in sub - Saharan African countries and other areas of the world .
The ice sheet has melted earlier this season .
Consequently , experts have predicted that the world has at least ten years within which to lower the volume of greenhouse gas emissions before it is too late to redeem the situation .
A jeweler 's shop in Tokyo displayed a swimsuit , dress and shawl to go with it made of pure gold thread today . These were made by a workshop in the ancient capital , Kyoto .

The low - cut gold swimsuit with a low back weighs 500 grams , with a sales price of 10 million Japanese yen .
A spokesperson for the company said , " The dress and swimsuit can be worn just like ordinary clothing , but must be treated the same as jewelry , and can not be washed in a washing machine . "
The company is also displaying a relatively inconspicuous gold wall tapestry , which can be used to decorate the living room , at a price of 50 million Japanese yen ( about 13.42 million NT dollars ) .

1 . Chinese Academy of Sciences . To be trained according to the Hundred Talents Program and paid according to the Hundred Talents Program benefits , but there is no guarantee I will definitely get it .
Although there are still papers to be published after I return to my country , they 're quite useless for the application to the Hundred Talents Program .

Why must he go to a city with many Chinese people ?
Actually , so what if he goes to Milwaukee ? There is no superstar there , but this is exactly his chance .
Moreover , he is not qualified to bargain with his owner when he has yet to prove his power on the NBA court .
On second thought , he can absolutely play in another city when his rookie player contract ends after three to four years .

Four years of World War I ended in 1918 .
In early 1919 , Gu Weijun , the Chinese envoy to the United States , went to France to participate in the Paris Peace Conference as the plenipotentiary of his own country 's government .
Xiao Kejian , Gu Weijun 's good friend , was arrested by French police for organizing a strike in Paris to fight for equal pay for equal work for Chinese workers in France .
However , his extreme action of joining Korean revolutionists in bombing the hotel the Japanese delegation lived in made Korea and China the center of public opinion .
The Paris Peace Conference rejected China 's just request in the end and decided to let Japan take over Germany 's special rights over Jiaodong Peninsula .
This caused the momentous " May 4 th " Movement to break out in the country , and Xiao Kejian and others also protested in Paris .

The Israeli newspapers that were published yesterday devoted supplements to the one year anniversary of the July war , which covered the different aspects of this war and its repercussions on Israel .
According to Alof Ben in Haaretz , the biggest loser in this war is Ehud Olmert and the Kadima party , and the theory of unilateral Israeli withdrawals .
On the other hand , the war has strengthened the position of the right and its leader , Benjamin Netanyahu , and it helped to bring Ehud Barak back to the government .
But the most critical review is the one by Ben Kasbit in Maariv . He wrote : " Did we win the war that broke out exactly a year ago , or were we defeated ?
Not exactly .
But since Israel must win the confrontation with its enemy , the draw equals a defeat .
Is our position today better than what it was a year ago on the eve of the war ?
Is the position of Hezbollah better today than it was a year ago ?
No , the party has been dealt quite a major military blow , but from another point of view , it achieved an important moral victory .
It is true that it was pushed back off the border fence , but it is entrenching and fortifying itself to the north of the Litani .
It withstood its confrontation with the Israeli military might , but it lost many of its troops and lost the element of surprise .

Since the start of this campaign in April / " April " , warnings have been issued to thousands of women , among whom hundreds have been arrested for not abiding by the religious dress code .
Women , whether Iranian or foreign , have been required to wear the veil since the Islamic Revolution in the year 1979 , but recent years saw some relaxation , particularly with respect to wearing the veil .
The Ministry requested that the officers of this Committee hand over the persons whom they arrest to regular police forces , which are to carry out their own interrogations of them .
This religious police force is also under investigation following a campaign of raids during which an Asian woman fell to her death from the fifth floor last May in the region of Holy Mecca .

The Court also found that Newnham had been convicted on charges of shoplifting from stores almost every year over a period of 36 years .
Newnham said that robbing the bank was much easier than sorting out his affairs and his retirement spending outside the prison .
The issue therefore does not concern some opinions that provoke waves of objection , but rather it fundamentally concerns a vision of the role of the Church , its ideology , and its universal message .
So the beginning denied the relationship between Islam and reason , as though Islam is a religion that is hostile to reason and there is no place for reason in the Islamic faith .
The search for a war in which victory would be easy is in reality no more than an electoral campaign . This campaign can only succeed in electing or re - electing the neo - conservatives as leaders of the United States .

Government sources said on January 7 , 2002 that a united nation nuclear team will make a week @-@ long visit to North Korea this weekend to inspect the Stalinist state 's controversial nuclear site .
The upcoming visit is viewed as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) drive to clarify North Korea 's nuclear ambitions .
A government source stated the visit by a group of IAEA safety experts is scheduled to last for a week beginning January 12 , 2002 .
The source stated that the inspection would focus on an isotope production laboratory in the Yongbyon nuclear complex which is north of North Korea 's capital Pyongyang .
The IAEA tour of the isotope production laboratory will unlikely give a full picture of North Korea 's suspected nuclear weapons ambitions .
The tour was a surprise offer made by North Korea in November 2001 .
IAEA accepted North Korea 's proposal last month but cautioned that the proposal is not a breakthrough .
IAEA also stated the lab is not one of the frozen facilities it wants to look into .
IAEA is based in Vienna and is the UN 's nuclear supervisor .
North Korea has denied the IAEA full access to its facilities .
North Korea froze its suspected nuclear weapons program at Yongbyon in exchange for receiving two nuclear reactors producing less weapons @-@ grade plutonium under a 1994 accord with the United States .

A South Korean group has announced a campaign backed by food scientists to promote the eating of dog meat .
This announcement was in response to increasing foreign criticism of the way dogs are slaughtered in South Korea .
The killing of dogs for restaurants has become a more popular topic than the football World Cup finals .
The World Cup finals are to be co @-@ hosted by South Korea and Japan this year .
The debate was partly fueled by FIFA , football 's international governing body .

The organizers of the South Korean website accused the broadcasters of falsely describing South Koreans and their food culture as barbaric .
The anti @-@ Japan group stated that South Korean culture is under attack .
The statement was made to gain supporters to join the lobbying .
Cyber warfare has become a common weapon for South Koreans .
They are one of the most Internet savvy nations in the world .
South Korean cyber campaigners disabled Japanese education ministry websites last year in a protest against history books accused of skimming Japan 's wartime record in Asia .
The nationalist group was formed to campaign against Japan .
The group said the foreign broadcasters are battering the eating dogmeat culture and that it is insulting behavior .
It tramples on a tradition of one country .
The group said the foreign broadcasters do not show any remorse for their culture of eating snails and horses .
The cyber attack is to show the power of South Koreans and Asians against the West 's sense of superiority and ignorance of South Korea 's history .
Another group said they will launch an association next Monday of around 100 dog meat restaurant owners in the Seoul region and hold a seminar to promote the dish .
Food scientist at Chung Chong College an Yong @-@ geun said he would introduce some 350 different kinds of culinary art with dog meat .

Head of the Korean Football Association and a FIFA vice president Chung Mong @-@ Joon said FIFA should not intervene in the eating habits of a sovereign nation .
South Korean officials said most dogs used for eating were killed instantly by electrocution .
Activists contend many slaughterhouses in the countryside are not controlled .
They strangle dogs , hang them by a rope and beat them in line with traditional practice to make the meat more tender .
Dog restaurants were told to close or go into the backstreets when Seoul hosted the 1988 Olympics .
No similar move is planned for the World Cup .
The authorities say the practice is slowly disappearing in Korea .
A recent survey stated that about one million dogs are sold every year for food in South Korea and 92 percent of men aged 20 and above and 68 percent of adult women have tasted dog meat .

Critical infrastructures including energy and transportation providers cite close work with Government to remain aware of threats and to update accordingly .
A recent government warning that al-Qaeda terrorists could launch a cyberattack on Canadian interests or critical infrastructure has caused many concerned industries to review their security systems .
Vice President of Canadian electricity Association Francis Bradley stated that the company has a warning system for both physical and cyberattacks .
Bradley stated that the company has been significantly focused on prevention of cyberattacks .
In a recent interview Bradley stated that many utility firms perform a brief review of their multi @-@ tiered response systems after such warnings are issued .
The warning from the Canadian Department of National Defense 's office of critical infrastructure protection and emergency service was quietly released on 20 December 2001 and cited no specific threat .
Director of threat analysis at the Canadian Department of National Defense 's office of critical infrastructure protection and emergency service Brenda hensler @-@ Hobbs stated that following the attacks of 11 September 2001 the Canadian Government specifically examined the potential cyber @-@ capability of al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden 's followers .
Hensler @-@ Hobbs stated that the Canadian government has no knowledge of Al-Qaeda having engaged in cyberattacks in the past but that leader bin Laden has suggested that if he chose to launch cyberattacks he could have the means available to him .
In summary of the recent warning stating that such an attack could be executed in the very near future hensler @-@ Hobbs stated that bin Laden 's location was irrelevant because bin Laden possesses the money and supporters necessary to have such an attack executed by others .
A number of al-Qaeda militants including Millennium plot bomber Ahmed Ressam are known to have remained in Canada .
Many are located in Montreal .
Hensler @-@ Hobbs stated that the proliferation and availability of Hacker tools and the low skill level needed to conduct cyberattacks demonstrate the ease of launching an attack anywhere .
Hensler @-@ Hobbs cited the example of the Montreal @-@ based Hacker known as mafiaboy who attacked U.S. websites including Amazon.com in 2000 .

Cole stated --
Bell Canada works very closely with the Government and the private sector to be aware of security concerns and to update accordingly .
Bell Canada worked closely with U.S. officials and firms after the attacks of 11 September 2001 .
Bell Canada provides a total of 26 million phone and Internet connections to a nation of 30 million people .
Bradley stated --
Electricity firms have strong warning systems that are coordinated by the North American Electric reliability Council .
There has not been a cyber event that has resulted in a loss of power for utility customers .
There is little possibility that a cyberattack would disable a North American electric grid .
Electric companies are well prepared and are making all preparations required to be ready for any physical or cyberattack .
The North American Electric reliability Council 's 30 largest utility companies went on their highest alert on September 11 and many still have an increased security presence in effect and plan to extend it further .

The Kamchatenergo company disconnected a major control center of the Russian space forces located in Kamchatka early Saturday , the Russian Space Forces press service said .
Kamchatenergo feeds power to the vast Kamchatka peninsula in Russia 's far east .
A statement from the Russian Space Forces press services on 020126 called the action a direct violation of government decrees on defense facilities and stated that it could have led to the loss of a spacecraft costing hundreds of millions of rubles .
The monitoring center is a key element in maintaining Russia 's satellite network in orbit and plays a part in operations of the international space platform Alfa .
Officials at the command center took urgent measures to use reserve power units to keep the system functioning and to temporarily provide residential centers with electricity .
Several other military bases and strategic defense units were affected .
The State power monopoly United energy services and its regional subsidiary Kamchatenergo launched a program of power cuts to long-term debtors on 020125 .
United energy services argues that non @-@ payment of bills has prevented it from maintaining supplies .
The Russian Space Forces , the space branch of Russia 's armed forces , expressed alarm at the prospect of further power cuts resulting from delays in Federal budget resources reaching local authorities on time .

A weekend black @-@ out at a command center in the Far East Kamchatka Peninsula of the Russian space forces had not affected the international space station ( ISS ) .
The Kamchatka Command Center maintains Russia 's satellite network in orbit .
The Kamchatka command center plays a role in ISS operations .
cutting power to command centers could pose dangers for Russian space installations .
Power cuts could lead to a failure of all work with space craft .
The ISS could function for an orbit or two without ground control by using standby systems .
A total unexpected loss of power during control of military equipment could be catastrophic .
The Government or UES or the Ministry of Defense must resolve the issue .
The Kamchatenergo company feeds power to Kamchatka Peninsula .

An Australian jury found that an Uzbekistan Olympic boxing official was defamed in a book about alleged Olympic corruption in which he was depicted as a major international heroin dealer and racketeer .
A New South Wales Supreme Court jury took just over 2 hours on 020201 to find Gafur Rakhimov had been libelled in a book the Great Olympic swindle which alleges Olympic corruption .
Gafur Rakhimov is an Uzbekistan Olympic boxing official and was depicted in the book as a major international heroin dealer and racketeer .
The Great Olympic swindle was written by British journalist Andrew Jennings and published by Simon and Schuster .
The Rakhimov case will now go to a single judge to hear defences and decide any damages to be awarded to Rakhimov .
The Great Olympic swindle implied that Gafur Rakhimov had been engaged in fraud , prostitution , assassination , gun running and plutonium smuggling .
The book also implied that the businessman was a gangster in the Soviet black economy and had traded sporting medals for bribes .
Rakhimov was Vice @-@ President of the Olympic Council of Asia and an Executive Member of the International Amateur Boxing Association .
Rakhimov was also said to have bribed members of the International Amateur Boxing Federation in the vote for the Federation Presidency .
Jennings is a long @-@ time critic of the International Olympic Committee .
The 020201 verdict followed 2 defamation actions brought last year by Rakhimov against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) and Jennings and against the Sydney Morning Herald ( SMH ) and Jennings .
A jury found in the case involving the ABC that ABC 's flagship current affairs program four corners had implied Rakhimov knew some of the world 's most dangerous criminals and was suspected by the FBI of drug trafficking .
That Panel found those insinuations were not defamatory and threw out the case against the ABC and Jennings .
The SMH and Jennings were then sued over 3 articles published in the lead @-@ up to the 000000 Olympics .
The jury in that case found Rakhimov had been painted as a major international criminal and had been defamed .

OSCE urges permanent end to Afghan terrorism and drug @-@ trafficking to create long-term stability in Central Asia .
Expert states that cultivation of opium and drug trafficking are deeply entrenched in Afghanistan and will be impossible to eradicate .
On 10 February 2002 an official with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe was quoted as stating that long-term stability in Central Asia depends on eradicating post @-@ Taliban Afghan terrorism and drug @-@ trafficking .
The OSCE envoy in neighboring Tajikistan Marc Gilbert stated to the government weekly national gazette that there are now hopes that Afghanistan will develop its democratic institutions and end terrorism and drug @-@ smuggling resulting in greater stability in Central Asia .
Gilbert stated that the post @-@ Soviet republics in central Asia fought terrorism by giving material and other necessary help to the international anti @-@ terrorist coalition in the war against Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden and the Taliban regime .
Both Tajikistan and Uzbekistan share a border with Afghanistan and have experienced raids by Taliban @-@ backed Islamic militants in recent years .
Neighboring Kyrgyzstan has also experienced raids by Taliban @-@ backed Islamic militants in recent years .
Kazakhstan also became a key U.S. partner in the Afghan war opening its airspace to military overflights .
Turkmenistan maintained a more neutral stance .
Turkmenistan borders Afghanistan .
Gilbert stated that Tajikistan 's positive and responsible approach to the crisis in Afghanistan has significantly improved the country 's image internationally .
Tajik government expert and head of the Tajik Drug Control Agency Vladimir Rakhmonov stated on 10 February 2002 that the U.S. @-@ led war in Afghanistan had failed to stop drug trafficking across the border into Tajikistan .
Rakhmonov stated to Interfax --
Opium and heroin are a form of hard @-@ currency reserve for Afghanistan .
Drug trafficking from Afghanistan has been concealed so securely that it will be impossible to uncover .
Drug trafficking from Afghanistan resumed during a brief hiatus in the anti @-@ terrorist operation .
In 2001 Tajik law @-@ enforcement agencies and Russian border guards seized 8.8 tons of drugs including 4.2 tons of heroin .
This represented a 26 percent increase overall in 2001 with 3 times the amount of heroin .
Suggestions that there are no longer drug lords in Afghanistan and that drug traffic into Tajikistan has been eradicated are unrealistic and false .
Many years would be needed to convert Afghanistan 's agriculture historically specialized in the growing of raw opium .
Cultivation of raw opium provided the only source of income for much of the rural population .
Tajikistan 's 780 @-@ mile border with Afghanistan is patrolled by approximately 11000 Russian soldiers under a 1992 agreement between the Russian and Tajik Governments .

Afghan officials conducted talks with Russian officials asking for assistance in stopping Afghanistan 's large illegal opium and heroin trade .
Afghanistan seeks to end poppy harvesting and increase border control .
March 1 , 2002 interim interior minister of Afghanistan Yunus Qanooni asked Russian officials to assist in combating the drugs trade and establishing security in Afghanistan .
Qanooni is a member of the Northern Alliance .
Qanooni told Russian Deputy Minister for Emergency Situations Yury Vorobyov --
Unfortunately over the past six years , the rule of the Taliban turned Afghanistan into a center of terrorism and drugs .
The struggle against terrorism and against drugs , and the establishment of security is a priority for the Administration of Afghanistan .
But combating terrorism and drugs requires joint efforts .
Peace and stability in Afghanistan is not only in the interests of the Afghani people and nation but of all the countries in the region .
Afghanistan 's interim government stated that it would take firm measures very quickly to prevent the harvest of poppy in the wake of the Taliban regime 's fall late last year .
Leader of Afghanistan 's interim government Hamid Karzai said the fight against poppy harvesting and the lucrative trafficking of opium and heroin will be a top priority .
The anti @-@ drug effort is strongly supported by Western countries , whose populations are a major market for heroin and opium from Afghanistan .
February 28 , 2002 Kabul officials announced that Afghan police are creating their first anti @-@ narcotics units with the help of the United Nations due to concern that the country could again become a major producer of opium .
February 28 , 2002 Qanooni stated in talks with Russian Interior Minister Boris Gryzlov that Afghanistan 's main task is to prevent future drugs production .
Qanooni outlined a three @-@ stage plan of action --
Afghan authorities will seek to ban poppy harvesting .
Afghan authorities will strengthen the borders around Afghanistan .
Afghan authorities will cooperate with the security forces of neighboring states .
Afghanistan is thought to be responsible for 75 percent of the world 's opium and 80 percent of the heroin traded illegally in Europe .
Approximately 11000 Russian guards patrol the 1200 @-@ kilometre ( 750 @-@ mile ) border between Russia and Afghanistan under a 1992 agreement signed by Moscow and Dushanbe .
The Northern Alliance opposes the Taliban but tolerated the harvest of poppy in territory it controlled .
Afghanistan 's interim government has been in power for 2 months .

South Korea 's defense ministry under attack in parliament over allegations it is favoring U.S. company Boeing for multi @-@ billion @-@ dollar fighter project .
Newspaper reports reveal that French @-@ made plane was rated higher in air force evaluations and that the Government is instead responding to political pressure from the U.S. and Boeing .
South Korea 's Defense Ministry came under attack in Parliament on 04 March 2002 over allegations that it is favoring U.S. company Boeing for a multi @-@ billion @-@ dollar fighter project .
Ruling and opposition lawmakers criticized the Ministry as newspapers reported that the French @-@ made fighter Rafale had scored the highest marks of any of the 4 contenders in field tests performed by South Korean Air Force evaluators .
The 3.2 billion U.S. dollar project to buy 40 fighters will be one of the most important international military contracts awarded this year but it has encountered multiple obstacles .
Award of the contract was temporarily suspended in February 2002 after the prices offered by 4 bidders were judged too high .
South Korea 's defense ministry promised to conclude its first @-@ stage appraisal by the end of March 2002 .
There has also been much newspaper speculation that the South Korean government might yield to U.S. pressure to buy Boeing 's aged F-15 k .
Speculation grew in February 2002 when Defense Minister Kim Dong @-@ Shin stressed that South Korea should consider security ties with the United States in the project .
The other competing planes are the Dassault firm 's Rafale , the Eurofighter Consortium 's typhoon 2000 and the Russian Su-32 made by Sukhoi .
Dassault is seeking its first foreign order for the Rafale .
Kang Chang @-@ Sung of the opposition Grand National Party expressed doubt of the fairness of the evaluation methods stating that his party suspects that the Defense Ministry has political reasons to select the F-15 k .
The ruling Millennium Democratic Party also accused the Ministry of favoring the F-15 k despite the defense chief 's insistence that there was no favoritism toward Boeing .
Kim stated --
There has been no pressure from the United States .
There would be an investigation into how classified documents had been leaked .
The Defense Ministry was further pressured by numerous newspaper reports of the Air Force 's evaluation of the Rafale as excellent in all categories .
Newspapers stated that the F-15 k was rated excellent in reliability and support combat capability but met only 30 percent of core technology requirements .
Newspapers stated that the Eurofighter was rated excellent in general function and reliability categories but the Rafale also earned the excellent rating for its weapons and electronic warfare capability .
The Su-35 placed fourth with ratings of ordinary in all five categories .
Rafale reportedly offered more generous terms for technology transfer and subcontracts for South Korea 's aerospace industry .
The Ministry stated that the air force was just 1 of 4 evaluations .
Some analysts have stated that the study method is biased toward Boeing noting that the evaluation was revised in February 2002 to ensure that all 4 bidders would receive an automatic 60 points for technology transfer .
The English @-@ language Korea Herald newspaper stated that this revision gives an advantage to Boeing which has been reluctant to transfer core technology .
The Korea Herald stated that when evaluators were conducting their first @-@ stage reports the ministry ordered them to give each bidder grades within a range of 60 to 100 points instead of 0 to 100 points .
The Korea Herald stated that critics say Boeing would benefit most from the points minimum because it would gain fewer points than Dassault in terms of technology transfer and subcontracts .

A senior South Korean minister on Friday warned that there could be a new crisis this year over inspections of the rival North 's nuclear program .
Senior South Korean minister Jeong Se @-@ hyun on 020329 warned that tensions could rise because North Korea wants inspections of its nuclear facilities delayed .
Unification Minister Jeong is the South Korean government 's chief policymaker for relations with North Korea .
Jeong said in a lecture on South Korea and US relations with North Korea that there was some talk in the United States that the nuclear inspection in North Korea should be carried out in 020800 .
North Korea 's suggestion is that the inspection should be delayed until 050000 .
Jeong said that a crisis could come in 020800 on the Korean peninsula if this issue becomes an international point of contention .
Following Jeong 's comments another senior government official sought to play down Jeong 's remarks about the looming troubles .
The unnamed official told the Yonhap national news agency that talk of pressing for IAEA inspections in 020800 had come only from private researchers in the United States .
The official said it was speculation that the North Korean government thinks the inspections should be delayed until 050000 .
Top South Korean envoy Lim Won @-@ dong intends to raise international concerns about the North 's nuclear and missile programs when he goes to Pyongyang 020403 .
Lim is a special advisor to President Kim Dae @-@ jung on national security and foreign affairs .
Lim has also warned of a looming nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula .
Military officials said Lim intimated the problems could be as serious as a 940000 nuclear standoff over North Korea 's suspected nuclear weapons development that came close to conflict .
The North Korean government agreed to freeze the North Korean nuclear program under an accord with a US @-@ led international consortium .
The consortium is to build 2 light water nuclear reactors that produce less weapons grade fuel than North Korea 's old graphite reactors and provide substitute fuel until they are built .
The original 030000 target date for completion has been put back at least 5 years because of major political and construction delays .
The 940000 Accord stipulated that the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) must be allowed to inspect North Korea 's old facilities to see if plutonium has been processed before the core facilities of the new reactors are installed .

The majority of Tajikistan 's heroin addicts live in cities and are aged between 18 and 25 .
75 percent of Tajikistan 's population lives in rural areas , where heroin addicts are frequently ostracized .
Head of a public drug clinic in Dushanbe , Tajikistan Andrei Onishchenko , stated --
There are 5000 heroin addicts officially registered in Tajikistan , compared with 57 in 1997 .
The actual figure is seven times greater than the official number .
The low cost and availability of heroin are among the causes of the addiction problem .
One dose of heroin costs less than a dollar in Tajikistan , which is less than the price of a bottle of the local vodka .
an addict who has been using heroin for 2 years needs to use 3 grams of heroin every 24 hours .
3 grams of heroin costs 70 somonis or 30 dollars .
an addict is willing to commit any crime to pay for heroin .
Afghan heroin is the strongest in the world because it is made from poppies cultivated at high altitudes and therefore subjected to high doses of ultra @-@ violet light .
A person who takes a daily dose of Afghan heroin has a life expectancy of between 5 and 7 years and many commit suicide before that .
The Tajik State pays 25 dirams ( a few cents ) per day for every person in the rehabilitation clinics .
The percentage of relapses is very high due to the lack of followup treatment and unemployment among young people .

On 22 May 2002 officials stated that Taiwan National Chen Chi Tien was executed by firing squad in Vietnam 's 8 th execution of a foreigner .
Chen was sentenced to death in 1997 for the illegal manufacture of methamphetamines disguised as a soap manufacturing plant .
Court officials in the commercial capital stated that Chen was executed in Ho Chi Minh City on 21 May 2002 .
The businessman was arrested with several Vietnamese accomplices in 1995 after 170 kilograms ( 375 pounds ) of methamphethamine chlorohydrate were found stored in the downtown soap factory Chen had established in 1994 .
Police established that Chen had already exported at least 4 shipments of the drug before his illegal manufacturing operation was discovered .
Chen traveled to Vietnam regularly since 1992 .
The crystalline amphetamine derivative is Smokable and has a very large illegal market in East Asia .
The drug is also known as ice or shabu .
Vietnam has executed 1 Western national to date .
The Western national executed was a Vietnamese @-@ Canadian woman whose execution in 2000 caused a diplomatic controversy with Canada .

Min took pictures of millions of dollars worth of poppy seeds , refined drugs and precursor chemicals curling up in smoke .
AFP , members of international and local press , and United Nations representatives and diplomats witnessed Myanmar destroy illicit drugs the authorities captured .
Min said Myanmar would be one of the richest countries in the region if they were as corrupt as outsiders claimed .
Hla Min stated that illicit drugs worth some 50 billion dollars have been destroyed by authorities since 1974 .
Min said it was enough to pay Myanmar 's national debt ten times over .
Drug @-@ burning ceremonies are regular events in Myanmar .
Critics argue that it does not reflect the massive drug industry in the country .
Resident Representative of the UN 's Drug Control Program ( UNDCP ) Jean @-@ Luc Lemahieu said this one is different .
Almost 102 tons of poppy seeds were burnt in the capital of Myanmar 's northern Shan state at this ceremony .
The ceremony also included 249 kilograms of opium , 102 kilograms of morphine powder , three kilograms of solid morphine and various precursor chemicals .
Lemahieu said that this ceremony had less processed opium and heroin than opium seeds .
It made it more symbolic and indicated the willingness of those directly involved to eliminate the opium .
The destruction forms part of the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control 's project new destiny .
It aims to prevent poppy cultivation by distributing seeds for substitution crops .
Farmers have been asked to grow seven kinds of alternative crops across 21,969 acres ( 8,891 hectares ) of land instead of opium .
Global narcotics authorities declared Myanmar the world 's largest producer of opium in 2001 .
They accounted for as much as 60 percent of global supply .
Myanmar beat Afghanistan because the Taliban militia 's enforced ban on opium poppies decreased Afghan production by 90 percent .
Critics said the Myanmar regime overlooks much of the production and trafficking in drugs by ethnic insurgent groups .
In particular the largest armed drug militia in the world the United Wa State Army .
Myanmar 's Home Minister Colonel Tin Hlaing said the success of project new destiny is evidenced by the tons of poppy seeds that have been turned in rather than seized .
Hlaing stated his confidence in the drug scourge that threatens the world will not find a place in Myanmar if the local population is committed to this sort of cooperation .
Lauk Kai is one of the regime 's showpieces for its previous crop substitution programs .
It has expanses of rubber trees , fruit orchards and paddy where poppies used to thrive .
The poppies yielded the raw ingredient for heroin .
Lauk Kai is located in the infamous Golden Triangle .
Reformed drug lord and leader of the Kokang phone Kyar Shin pledged commitment to the government program .
The Kokang comprise the majority of the population in Myanmar .
Phone Kyar Shin predicts that starting today there will be no destruction ceremony in the future because no more poppy will be grown .
Phone Kyar Shin said this at another ceremony that destroyed more than 12 tons of poppy seed .
Phone Kyar Shin appealed for help from the international community .
The international community is reluctant to give help .
Phone Kyar Shin requested the distinguished guests to understand Myanmar 's situation more and give practical advice and support .
UNDCP 's Lemahieu when asked by AFP what impact project New Destiny had on the international community hoped it would have a positive impact and that some additional funds would come forward .
Lemahieu said so much depends on the political situation in this country .
There is hope for further political change following the May 6 release of pro @-@ democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from 19 months house arrest .

Ecological organization Greenpeace stated on June 21 , 2002 that Russia helped Iran to develop nuclear weapons by building Iran 's Bushehr atomic power station .
The Russian branch of Greenpeace distributed a report at a press conference of Russia 's atomic energy ministry .
The ministry conceded that the Russo @-@ Iranian accord on the plant 's construction does not require the repatriation of the nuclear fuel .
The report stated that the recycling of nuclear fuel from Bushehr is not mentioned in the accord between the Russian and Iranian governments on the construction of the plant .
Greenpeace member Vladimir Chuprov said the ministry had practically admitted that Iran will not return to Russia the spent nuclear fuel from the power station and Russia 's only use for Iran is to equip itself with nuclear weapons .
The atomic energy ministry confirmed the report 's existence and strongly denied Greenpeace 's accusations .
Ministry spokesman Nikolai Shingarev told AFP that Russia would only supply nuclear fuel to Iran on condition that it be returned to Russia after its use .
Shingarev said Russia is currently in negotiations with Iran .
This issue will be settled before the power station comes into operation .
Shingarev said the accord on Bushehr was signed before Russia passed a law permitting the import of nuclear waste last year .
This explains why the accord makes no mention of the return of the fuel .
Shingarev said it is very difficult to make a nuclear weapon from the plutonium in this fuel .
The United States and Israel fear that the Russian @-@ Iranian nuclear cooperation could enable Tehran to acquire the technology needed to build nuclear weapons .
Russia dismisses this accusation .
Iran ordered the power station in 1994 at a cost of nearly 800 million dollars ( 860 million euros ) from Russia .
Iran has said the plant is being built only for civilian energy purposes and allows regular inspections of Bushehr by the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Experts say Bushehr could in theory become operational as early as September 2003 .
Currently it is equipped with a single reactor .

Malaysian defense analyst dzirhan mahadzir stated --
Cooperation by poorer countries may be stymied by financial constraints and a perception that terrorism does not directly affect these countries .
An ASEAN pact is beneficial in the long-term but will be difficult to implement because national security issues and interstate rivalry may make some of ASEAN 's 10 members wary to divulge information .
ASEAN must agree on a definition of terrorism to identify the common enemy .

Objections were raised concerning Malaysia 's proposal to include State terrorism in the definition .
Dzirhan stated --
The agreement among Malaysia , Indonesia and the Philippines may have been aimed at ingratiating the countries to the US rather than combating terrorism .
Since the pact was signed no progress has occurred .
The creation of a formalized security structure in combating terror will be decelerated by the ASEAN 's model of acting on consensus .

On 18 October 2002 International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) director Mohamed ElBaradei stated it is unlikely that Iraq could conceal a nuclear weapons program if it allowed international inspectors to return .
ElBaradei stated that once inspectors were working in Iraq their presence alone would be a deterrent to developing nuclear weapons .
ElBaradei stated to reporters at his headquarters in Vienna --
It is difficult to conceal a nuclear program if thorough inspections are performed because nuclear products always have a signature .
Traces are always visible if highly enriched uranium or plutonium were used .
ElBaradei stated that inspectors would perform environmental sampling , gamma radiation surveys from helicopters , internal periodic visits to all capable sites and interviews with all former nuclear scientists to confirm that they are not working in the nuclear program .
ElBaradei stated that the IAEA could not give a 100 percent guarantee but that the presence of inspectors would be a good deterrent and a good mechanism for detection .
ElBaradei stated --
It is necessary to control imports to Iraq because of the risk that Iraq is receiving nuclear material from outside the country .
There must be physical protection of all nuclear material particularly in the former Soviet Union .
There must be strong unanimous support by the UN Security Council to force Iraq to comply with IAEA inspection .
The IAEA must be given as much intelligence information as possible to guide inspectors to anything that should be inspected or to any item hidden from inspectors .
The Security Council has been meeting in open session to discuss the Iraq issue before the vote on conditions under which UN weapons inspectors will return to Baghdad to verify Iraqi assertions that it does not possess nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .

Bangladesh opposition claims a crime crackdown being carried out by the army is becoming political witchhunt , and human rights groups claim fundamental rights are being violated .
Bangladesh 's main opposition leader Sheikh Hasina Wajed said 021102 that an army crackdown on crime was turning into a political witchhunt and targeting her Awami League party .
Troops were ordered into the streets more than 2 weeks ago to eliminate rampant crime but human rights groups claim fundamental rights are being trampled .
Newspapers and rights groups put the toll of those who have died in police and military custody at 16 .
Officials say more than 3400 people have been taken into custody since the crackdown began 021017 .
The government has confirmed the deaths of 12 people due to heart attacks .
Relatives allege some suspects have been tortured in custody .
The US government and London @-@ based Amnesty International have also expressed concern about the custodial deaths .
Amnesty urged a prompt and fair investigation by an independent body into the deaths .
Sheikh Hasina told reporters at the airport on her return from a private trip to the United States and Europe that initially it appeared to be a neutral anti @-@ crime drive and the opposition Awami League party welcomed it .
Hasina said the crackdown is gradually turning into one to eliminate the Opposition .
Hasina wants the military to arrest real criminals and not violate Bangladesh 's constitution and human rights because of concern about such violations in the name of anti @-@ crime drive .

Yakovenko said the Russian Government finds it inadmissible to link individual States or religions with terrorism or extremism and is grateful to those Arab states which are trying to cooperate with Russian law enforcement agencies to cut channels for funding terrorist organizations .
The Russian government has consistently sought to portray its campaign against a separatist insurgency in Chechnya as part of the global war on terrorism and says that rebel groups are receiving backing from the terrorist Al-Qaeda network and from shadowy Islamic radical groups based in countries such as Saudi Arabia .
A senior Kremlin official said last week that the Russian Government might ask the GCC State Qatar to extradite Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev .
Yandarbiyev is a former Chechen Vice @-@ President and aide to rebel president Aslan Maskhadov .
The Russian government accuses Yandarbiyev of involvement in the 041000 hostage @-@ taking in a Moscow theater .
Russian government spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Qatar 's response would demonstrate the extent of that country 's willingness to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism .
Yakovenko said that stronger ties between Russia and the GCC States could play a special role in combating international terrorism .
Ivanov said al @-@ Attiya 's visit will contribute to increased cooperation between the Russian government and the six Arab monarchies of the Gulf region .
Ivanov said the Russian government wanted to strengthen its ties with the Gulf countries and that these ties have begun to strengthen recently .
Ivanovalso said the Russian government would like to develop them further and particularly in areas of mutual interest .
The Russian government has traditionally been close to the Arab side in the Middle East conflict and has spoken strongly against US armed intervention against Iraq in the stand @-@ off over disarmament .
Yakovenko said that Al @-@ Attiya 's talks with Russian government officials 021104 and 021105 were likely to focus on oil issues and noted that both the Russian government and the Gulf countries are interested in stable world prices .
Yakovenko said the main emphasis of the talks will be on Russia 's possible involvement in the implementation of regional projects run by the Council and said that there will be particular emphasis on finding peaceful , political and diplomatic ways to settle the Iraqi issue .
Al @-@ Attiya also plans to hold talks with economic ministers and senior officials such as the head of the Chamber of Commerce Yevgeny Primakov and the Chairman of the Russian employers @' association Arkady Volsky .

Sheni told delegates at the Global Forum for Health Research 's annual meeting that less than 10 percent of the global health research budget of 70 billion dollars went to Africa .
Africa has 90 percent of the global diseases .
Sheni said the formation of the Asian and Pacific Health Research Forum and the Latin American Health Research Forum are steps in the right direction .
Global Forum for Health Research Chairman Richard Feachem said it was unfair for poor countries to be allocated meager sums of research funding .
Feachem said the majority of the poor are getting little health research funding compared to the wealthy few .

New U.S. study claims that one @-@ tenth of Internet 's sites are blocked by the Chinese Government authorities using updated Filtering technology .
A wide range of sites including a very high percentage of news sites and keywords were found to be blocked .
A U.S. study released on 03 December 2002 states that one @-@ tenth of the Internet 's sites may be blocked by Chinese authorities as part of efforts to prevent access to information on dissidents , Taiwan , Tibet and other subjects .
The study was conducted by Harvard University 's berkman Center for Internet and society .
The study found that more than 50000 of the approximately 200000 websites tested were inaccessible from at least 1 point in China on at least 1 occasion .
Using a more narrow definition of blocked site the study concluded that 18931 websites were being blocked to Chinese web users .
Harvard researcher and co @-@ author of the report Ben Edelman stated that it is likely that similar percentages apply to the Internet as a whole .
Edelman told AFP that it is highly likely that approximately one @-@ tenth of the Internet is filtered by or recently has been filtered by China .
Edelman stated that there are many different ways to measure this effect and therefore hesitated to specify any single proportion .
The latest study was broader than prior surveys and gives perspective to disparate reports about websites that are filtered or blocked by China .
In the report it is concluded that --
China blocks a range of web content beyond that which is sexually explicit .
1000 s of sites providing information about news , health , education , and entertainment were blocked .
Approximately 3284 sites from Taiwan were blocked .
The blocked sites also included those of U.S. news organizations including ABC News and CBS News , the Alta Vista search engine , and a number of U.S. universities .
The researchers found that 100 percent of the top 10 sites with keywords Tibet , Taiwan China , or equality were blocked .
A large number of other sites with keywords such as freedom , democracy and HIV were also blocked .
The BBC news site was consistently unavailable .
Sites for CNN , Time magazine , U.S. @-@ based public broadcasting system , the Miami Herald , and the Philadelphia Inquirer were also often blocked .
The report found that 42 of google 's top 100 results for news were blocked .
Religious sites blocked in China included the Asian American Baptist Church , The atheist network , the Catholic Civil Rights League , Feng Shui , the Jewish Federation of Winnipeg , and the Denver Zen center .
China has an estimated 45 million Internet users .
China has been widely criticized in the West for blocking websites and for imprisoning people for viewing banned sites or using the Internet for anti @-@ government activities .
The Chinese government is believed to routinely block a large number of foreign @-@ based sites primarily those featuring dissident views or banned groups such as the Falungong spiritual organization but also certain foreign news sites and pages showing pornography .
A recent report by the U.S. @-@ based Rand Corporation think tank found that the Chinese government now uses more technology to filter out objectionable content rather than relying solely on surveillance of users and seizure of equipment as it did in the past .
The rand report released earlier in 2002 found that Chinese authorities now appear to have more effective technology for filtering out undesirable content .

A laboratory chief from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) said on December 10 , 2002 that the UN 's nuclear agency could detect infinitesimal amounts of radiation from weapons programs if they exist in samples from Iraq .
David Donohue spoke at the IAEA laboratory in Seibersdorf on the southwest outskirts of Vienna .
Donohue said the equipment can detect particles down to the picogram ( a millionth of a millionth of a gram ) .
The first samples from Iraq are due to arrive to the laboratory this week .
IAEA and other UN inspectors have been taking soil , water and air samples since November 27 , 2001 at Iraqi sites suspected of being used for programs to make weapons of mass destruction .
Donohue said samples will be sent for corroboration to labs in France , the US , the UK ( Britain ) , Japan and Russia if IAEA finds any traces of radiation from enriched uranium or plutonium , or any chemical and biological agents .
Donohue said it is very difficult to manipulate radioactive isotopes without leaving a trail .

South Korea urges North Korea to return nuclear reactor to UN surveillance .
North Korea had violated 1994 shut down by disabling surveillance devices .
20021222 South Korea urged North Korea to return the Yongbyon nuclear reactor to UN surveillance in order to deescalate the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula .
20021221 the UN International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) stated that North Korea had disabled IAEA surveillance devices by breaking seals on IAEA equipment and blocking surveillance cameras at the country 's 5 megawatt nuclear reactor .
20021221 IAEA Director General General Mohammed ElBaradei expressed regret over North Korea 's actions .
A South Korean Foreign Ministry official stated --
The development is regrettable and will increase tension over North Korea 's nuclear weapons program .
Japan and the United States should act jointly with South Korea .
The IAEA stated that ElBaradei warned the government of North Korea not to take further action that would prevent the IAEA from monitoring compliance with the 1994 accord with the United States shutting down the reactor .
20041212 North Korea stated that the country 's plutonium @-@ producing nuclear program would recommence in order to produce energy due to a global embargo on oil shipments .
In 1994 the reactor was frozen under an accord in exchange for 500000 tons of fuel oil annually from the United States .

North Korea removed UN seals at a laboratory suspected of being used to produce weapons @-@ grade material .
This activity further escalates tension in the Korean Peninsula 's nuclear crisis and ignores international condemnation .
A source close to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) said late on 021223 the North had started stripping the UN nuclear regulation group 's seals and monitoring equipment from the laboratory at Yongbyon .
The lab is suspected of having reprocessed fuel rods for weapons @-@ grade plutonium before its activities were frozen under a 940000 arms control deal with the United Sates .
The source is fully informed of IAEA activities in North Korea and said the North Koreans are cutting the seals of the nuclear fuel reprocessing laboratory and could complete it possibly by 021224 .
The move followed similar actions 021221 @-@ 021222 at the Yongbyon nuclear facility during which the North Korean government took control of 1000 s of spent fuel rods that could be used to make nuclear weapons .
The nuclear crisis dominated the first meeting between South Korean President Kim Dae @-@ Jung and President @-@ elect Roh Moo @-@ hyun earlier 021223 .
Kim and Roh were meeting for the first time since Roh 's election last week and the meeting was supposed to focus on smoothing over the 030225 transfer of power between the outgoing and incoming leaders .
The 90 @-@ minute talks instead centered on the North Korean government 's latest standoff with the international community .
President Kim 's spokeswoman Park Sun @-@ sook said that Kim and Roh 's discussion was pinned down on international relations which focused on North Korea 's nuclear issue .
The South Korean government 's frustration with the North Korean government was evident in a foreign ministry statement which urged the North Korean government to restore the seals and disabled monitoring cameras on the rods .
The statement said that the North Korean government took further actions to unfreeze its nuclear activities despite repeated warnings from the South Korean government and the international community and was raising regional tension and amplifying international concerns over nuclear proliferation .
The United States responded to that development with swift condemnation .
US State Department spokesman Louis Fintor said the over 8000 spent fuel rods are of particular concern because they can be reprocessed to recover plutonium for nuclear weapons .
US Senator Richard Lugar said the North Korean government was creating a very dangerous situation , initially for South Korea and for Japan but ultimately for the United States .
Lugar will head the Senate 's Foreign Relations Committee in 030000 .
The United States has been stepping up international pressure on the North Korean government since 021222 .
Deputy US Ambassador Evans Revere met South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Tai @-@ sik in Seoul on 021223 to discuss countermeasures to be taken against the North Korean government following the US and South Korean foreign ministers @' urgent talks over the phone .
Japanese Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi also expressed the widespread international alarm about the North Korean government 's regrettable latest move .
Analysts have said North Koreans could extract some 25 kilograms ( 55 pounds ) of weapons @-@ grade plutonium for at least 3 nuclear weapons from the irradiated rods .
The North Korean government said it unfroze its nuclear facilities because it was in a desperate energy crisis aggravated by the suspension of fuel oil shipments .
The US government said the spent plutonium has nothing to do with power generation .
The United States and North Korea came close to war over the North Korean government 's plutonium program in the early 1990 s .
The confrontation was defused when the US and North Korean Governments signed the 940000 agreed framework .
That accord has been undermined since the North Korean government admitted in 021000 to running a new , secret and separate program based on enriched uranium .

Plutonium could be extracted for making nuclear warheads within months .
The United States dismissed the action as nuclear blackmail .
There was strong criticism from the United Nations @' International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
Beginning last week IAEA saw its monitoring equipment disabled and seals removed from the nuclear facilities that had been dormant since a 1994 accord with the United States .
IAEA director Mohamed ElBaradei dismissed claims by North Korea 's government that it was only acting in the wake of an energy crisis in North Korea .
ElBaradei said that the reprocessing facility at Yongbyong is irrelevant to North Korea 's ability to produce electricity .
North Korea has no current legitimate peaceful use for plutonium given the status of its nuclear fuel cycle .
ElBaradei said restarting North Korea 's nuclear facilities without appropriate safeguards and towards producing plutonium raises serious non @-@ proliferation concerns is tantamount to nuclear brinkmanship .
The move of 1,000 unspent rods into the reactor building is the latest action taken by the energy @-@ starved North since the apparent collapse of a 1994 accord that froze its nuclear capacity .
The move is confirmed by both the UN agency and the South Korean Foreign Ministry .
The facility has the capacity for 8,000 rods .
All have been stored in a cooling pond at Yongbyon since the United States offered North Korea annual supplies of heavy fuel oil and two new light water nuclear reactors in return for Pyongyang 's agreement to freeze its nuclear operations at Yongbyon .

Nuclear reactor process --
4 meter fuel rods containing uranium oxide are burned to initiate fission -- the nucleus of the uranium atom is split , releasing neutrons that collide with other atoms , creating more neutrons in a chain reaction .
Fission produces immense heat which is applied to water to create steam which drives turbines to generate electricity .
Plutonium and other radioactive byproducts of the process accumulate and decrease the effectiveness of the rods until they are spent after 3 @-@ 4 years .
Spent rods consisting of highly radioactive plutonium and residual uranium are cooled in pools of water for several years to diminish radioactivity and then the plutonium is then recovered in nitrate form and converted into oxide .
The recovered plutonium can be mixed with uranium for reuse in the reactor or used in making nuclear weapons .
Nuclear experts stated that to make weapons , a high proportion of plutonium 239 ( military grade plutonium , as opposed to the commercial plutonium used in power plants ) must be extracted .

Plans for Soyuz launches have been delayed by funding issues since costly modifications to launch facilities must be made to accommodate the Russian rocket .
The European Space Agency ( ESA ) stated 10 January 2003 that it was finalizing a deal with the Russian government that could allow Soyuz rockets to be launched from Europe 's space command at Kourou , French Guiana .
The deal between the ESA and the Russian Government could be written as early as March 2003 and signed by the Russian government in April 2003 .
The deal would allow for Soyuz missiles to help replace phased @-@ out Ariane @-@ 4 launchers .
Ariane @-@ 4 launchers send payloads up to 2.8 tons into geostationary orbit .
Spacecraft launched from Kourou benefit from the Earth 's full rotational speed on the equator to aid their trajectory into space .
With this extra momentum , the spacecraft require less fuel .
Plans for the Soyuz launches have been delayed by funding issues since modifications to be made to launch facilities in order to accommodate the Russian rocket are predicted to cost between 250 and 300 million euro .
The Russian space program has experienced funding problems and was unwilling to contribute one third of the bill as ESA had requested .
In November 2002 the Government of France proposed to fund the Russian Government 's share with a loan to be paid back by profits from the launches .
The ESA stated that no financial divisions have been decided yet .
France joined Russia in creating a joint company Starsem in 1996 to commercialize and market the Soyuz launches from Russia 's Baikonur Space Center in Kazakhstan .
Soyuz missiles used to send satellites and cosmonauts into space are the most used type of spacecraft .

An Indian information technology expert disproved the phobia of cyber attacks and said the threat was overstated .
Director of the Indian Institute of Information Technology S. Sadagopan said the cyber attack is similar to the Y2K myth ; although these things could happen , they will not happen .
Y2K was a computer malfunction expected to occur when 1999 changed to 2000 but it did not inflict widespread damage .
Sadagopan addressed delegates at a conference on information security .
Sadagopan stated that these things happen with all technology if history is reviewed and that imaginative people can cause extraordinary problems even with primitive technology .
Sadagopan said the G8 nations have lost 43 billion dollars due to cyber crime .
The G8 nations are comprised of France , Britain , Canada , Germany , Italy , Japan , Russia and the United States .
Sadagopan said most people have an alarmist view of such attacks .
The attacks range from viruses , flame @-@ mail ( abusive e-mail ) , stone throwing ( disfiguring a home page ) to cyber squatters and scripts for breaking into Internet sites .
Sadagopan stated that many sensitive installations such as nuclear and power plants , and missiles have an Internet protocol address and that once someone hacks into the sites one can trip the power lines or lead planes and missiles to their choice destinations .
Sadagopan added that this type of hacking is possible , but there is no need to panic .
Sadagopan said it needs to be recognized and while we should be sensitive about such threats it should not be sensationalized rather a pragmatic approach should be taken .
The U.S. State Department said in May 2002 that a computer Hacker had infiltrated its e-mail system .
The Hacker sent a potentially damaging virus to more than 20000 people who receive travel warnings electronically .
A 50 @-@ line code of the love bug virus affects more than 2.8 million files monthly .
Hackers have sent love letter e-mail to all chosen Heads of States from adolfahitler.com .
Pentagon sites had denial of service for more than three hours .
India 's premier nuclear research center Bhabha Atomic resarch center sites were disfigured .
Sadagopan stated that a section of technologists think cyber soldiers , cyber policemen and cyber insurance is needed .
Sadagopan said the threat is overstated and that it is like any other threat , like a foreigner driving on Bangalore roads .
The threat needs to be accepted and then education is the next step .

Pakistan authorities announce upgrades of security of nuclear facilities and employees after press reports alleging leaks of its its nuclear technology .
Pakistan on 030122 announced upgrades to the security of nuclear facilities and employees after a series of press reports alleging leaks of nuclear technology to North Korea and possibly Iran and Iraq .
The Los Angeles Times , New York Times and Japanese media have carried several reports quoting unnamed US officials saying that Pakistani scientists or military officers had sold the North Korean government uranium @-@ enrichment technology for the nuclear program .
Pakistan 's government has angrily rejected the reports as malicious and insisted that nuclear technology had never been sold or leaked .
The military statement said Pakistan 's has a long @-@ standing capability for achieving the highest levels of safety and security which is adequate and fail @-@ safe .
The Pakistani government 's announcement came after President Pervez Musharraf chaired a meeting of the Development Control Committee of the National Command Authority ( NCA ) to review security of Pakistan 's nuclear program .
An official military statement said the physical protection and custodial controls at Pakistan 's nuclear sites and facilities has been recently upgraded .
The statement said the NCA gave approval for further tightening of different defensive layers and enhancing physical security as well as ensuring the effectiveness of watertight safety of materials , equipment and technology .
The NCA also adopted steps to improve personal reliability programs for people working in nuclear @-@ related programs .
Scientists , engineers and military officers working in nuclear programs are routinely screened every 2 years according to a survey of Pakistan 's nuclear security by Italy 's arms control institution the Landau network .
2 Pakistani nuclear scientists were arrested 12 months ago and interrogated by US Federal Bureau of Investigation agents on suspicion of possible cooperation with the Taliban .
These arrests underlined fears that nuclear technology could fall into the hands of Islamic extremists .
Pakistan 's government has been developing a nuclear program to match arch @-@ rival India 's since the 1970 s and only went public with the program in 980500 when testing 5 nuclear devices .
Jane 's Defence Weekly estimates that Pakistan 's government possesses 25 @-@ 50 nuclear warheads and has a uranium enrichment plant and plutonium reprocessing plant close to the capital Islamabad and at least 4 nuclear reactors across the country .
Pakistan 's NCA also decided on 030122 not to respond to India 's 3 missile tests this month and stated that Pakistan 's government has no desire to increase tension in the region .

Plutonium enough to produce 25 nuclear bombs which has gone unaccounted for at a Japanese nuclear facility is mostly due to measuring shortcomings and miscalculations .
A nuclear fuel reprocessing plant about 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) north of Tokyo in Tokaimura has extracted 6890 kilograms ( 15158 pounds or 7.6 short tons ) of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel since it began operating in 770000 .
A Japanese education and science ministry official said on 030128 that the total currently accounted for at the facility was 206 kg short of the plutonium initially estimated to have been produced by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel from power plants .
It is known to take 5 @-@ 8 kg of plutonium to produce a nuclear bomb .
The official at the ministry 's nuclear safeguard office said that the case had been reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) of the United Nations .
The finding was also reported to the Japanese government 's Atomic Energy Commission on 030128 .
The education and scienc Ministry denied the possibility that any plutonium had been illegally removed from the facility .
The official said 94 kg of the missing plutonium is presumed to have dissolved into waste water without being measured .
The official added that another 29 kg disintegrated into another type of element .
The official said that plutonium may have been stuck to fuel tubes or mixed with waste water being processed to be solidified in glass and disposed of .
The official also pointed to possible errors in the estimate of plutonium extracted in the process .
The official said that there was a need for improvements in measuring and evaluating methods of plutonium .
The report was based on inspections at the Tokaimura facility done under IAEA safeguard rules designed to prevent the transfer of nuclear materials for production of nuclear weapons .
Tokaimura is a Pacific Coast complex of nuclear @-@ related facilities and made headlines in 990000 when the world 's worst nuclear plant accident since Chernobyl in 860000 occurred at a uranium reprocessing plant there .
3 workers set off a critical reaction in 990000 when they poured too much uranium into a precipitation tank .

UN nuclear inspectors to depart for Iran to conduct inspections of 2 sites .
On 20 February 2003 Iranian opposition group National Council of Resistance of Iran ( NCRI ) stated that Iran was building banned uranium enrichment sites as part of a nuclear weapons program .
The statement was made on the evening preceding a UN team 's departure for Iran to conduct inspections at 2 nuclear sites .
U.S. Representative for NCRI soona samsami stated at a press conference in Washington D.C. that Iran 's strategy is to build weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons in particular in order to alter the balance of power in the region in its favor and to facilitate export of fundamentalism and terrorism .
UN International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and its director Mohamed ElBaradei depart for Iran 21 February 2003 to conduct an inspection at a site in Natanz where representatives of the NCRI have stated that the regime has concealed a test centrifuge .
NCRI showed satellite photographs of a site in Natanz portraying a cluster of warehouses in which the group claims the regime has hidden centrifuges used to enrich uranium that could be used in nuclear weapons .
Samsami stated that the clerical regime is taking advantage of the current crisis in the region and has accelerated its efforts to obtain nuclear weapons .
On 09 February 2003 Iranian President Mohammed Khatami recognized the existence of a uranium mine and extraction center but promised that the uranium would be used only for peaceful purposes .
The U.S. government was skeptical of Iran 's intentions and stated that Iran 's pursuit of a complete fuel cycle only made sense if it were pursuing nuclear weapons .
NCRI stated on 20 February 2003 that Iran 's clerical rulers are also building and have tested missiles that would eventually have a range of 4000 to 6000 kilometers ( 2500 to 3700 miles ) .
NCRI stated that the information on Iran 's weapons program had been supplied through their intelligence network within Iran and that satellite photographs were supplied by the Institute for Science and International Security .
The Institute for Science and International Security is a non @-@ profit clearinghouse for security information and images .
Samsami stated --
The Iranian government had removed sensitive equipment from the Natanz site in anticipation of the IAEA inspection this weekend .
The Iranian government intended to bar IAEA entry to 1 of the 5 large buildings where the centrifuge is located and would claim that it is a warehouse similar to the other 4 .
Samsami provided street addresses of the suspect facilities .
ElBaradei planned to conduct inspections at the Natanz facility south of Tehran and at the Arak site southwest of Tehran on 22 February 2003 and 23 February 2003 .
NCRI stated that the Arak site produces heavy water for the production of plutonium .
Plutonium is used as a trigger in nuclear weapons .
Samsami stated that such weapons are a matter of survival for the regime in Iran .
Samsami stated that Iran 's clerical regime is in a tenuous position facing unprecedented social disenchantment and expansion of popular resistance and would therefore not hesitate to use weapons of mass destruction to stabilize its position .
The Government of Iran revealed earlier this month that it had discovered uranium deposits near the central city of Yazd and that a uranium oxide plant had been completed in the central city of Isfahan and would be complemented by an enrichment plant now under construction near Kashan to its north .
The plant in Yazd Province would produce concentrated yellow cake uranium while another facility at an undisclosed location would complete the cycle by producing finished fuel made entirely in Iran .

Kashmiri militant groups claim responsibility for attack on Indian police post in the disputed region that killed at least 11 people .
Indian officials claim that foreign infiltrators from Pakistan executed the attack but local Kashmiri groups call this baseless propaganda .
On 16 March 2003 Kashmiri militants claimed responsibility for an attack on a police post in the disputed state of Kashmir in India stating that they attacked to avenge the killing of their commanders by Indian troops .
The Hizbul Mujahideen is the largest group fighting Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan region .
A spokesman for Hizbul Mujahideen who declined to be identified stated to AFP --
The attack was in retaliation to the recent killing of district commander Amanullah and 3 other fighters of Hizbul Mujahideen by the Indian army in Kashmir .
Approximately 10 to 15 fighters from Hizbul Mujahideen , Harkatul Mujahideen , Harkatul Jihad-e-Islami and Al Badar attacked the camp before midnight on 15 March 2003 and into 16 March 2003 and killed at least 12 soldiers .
All the fighters who participated in the operation were local Kashmiris not infiltrators from Pakistan as claimed by Indian officials .
The Indian claim that cross @-@ border incursions have increased is baseless and aimed at covering up its failures in occupied Kashmir .
The militants attacked the post in Gool in the Udhampur district approximately 95 miles north of Indian Kashmir 's winter capital Jammu .
At least 11 people were killed in the attack .
A spokesman for another Kashmiri separatist group called Harkatul Mujahideen agreed with the Hizbul official stating --
The attack was executed by local Kashmiri fighters affiliated with 4 groups .
If India blames foreign militants it is part of its propaganda to mislead the international community .
The Kashmir region is divided between India and Pakistan and is claimed by both .
India and Pakistan have fought 2 wars over Kashmir since each gained independence from Britain in 1947 .
India accuses Pakistan of funding and training rebels fighting to end Indian rule in Kashmir .
Pakistan denies the charge .
Since 1989 more than 37500 people have died in the insurgency in Kashmir .

The methamphetamine pills known as Yaa BAA have surpassed heroin as Thailand 's number one killer drug .
Several million Thai people use the drug .
The pill has become part of Thai society .
No other drug has become as integral in decades .
The effects on the brains of its consumers is disastrous .
Yaa BAA is known as crazy medicine in Thailand .
It has been targeted in a two @-@ month anti @-@ drugs crackdown that has resulted in the deaths of nearly 1,900 suspected traffickers .
There is much concern over the drug .
The drug 's popularity increased in the mid @-@ 1990 s .
It has made Thailand the world 's number one consumer .
Pierre @-@ Arnaud chouvy and Joel meissonnier state in their book Yaa BAA recently published by the Institute of Research on contemporary Southeast Asia that the psychotropic drugs is used across society for both work and pleasure .
Construction workers , sailors , farmers and taxi drivers take the drug to help them through long working days .
Students use it to get through exam periods .
Clubbers use it to help them dance all night .
Yaa BAA possesses several qualities that have helped it supplant heroin as the drug of choice in Thailand .
The book states that the drug conveys a completely positive image .
It appears modern and inoffensive because it is synthetic .
The energy , confidence and euphoric feeling has given users an image as a drug of happiness .
The pills can also be easily consumed .
They can be popped or dissolved in a glass of water , taken intravenously , pulverized and inhaled , or smoked .
There are at least 90 types of the pill .
Yaa BAA is easy to manufacture and do not have any climate uncertainties like other drugs have .
Instructions on how to manufacture the drug are available on the Internet .
Heroin requires opium poppy as its raw ingredient and cocaine depends on yields from the coca plant .
The drug has an affordable price .
It cost 60 baht ( 1.50 dollars ) per pill on the streets before Thailand 's drug war started on February 1 , 2003 and push the price up 300 percent .
The pill costs five @-@ cents to produce .
800 million pills entered Thailand from Myanmar last year .
The book states that the majority of the drug comes from Myanmar particularly the areas controlled by the Wa of the UWSA ( United Wa State Army ) .
The book is referring to the pro @-@ Yangon ethnic group said to operate around 50 laboratories close to the border and the mobile production units .
Myanmar could become an unrivaled regional producer because of the links between the military rulers and the UWSA , and the jungle canopy where UWSA operate .
The military and UWSA links result in a lack of law enforcement .
The drug has become a specialty of the Golden Triangle where Thailand , Laos and Myanmar converge .
Much of the world 's opium is still produced there .
Chouvy and meissonnier say that methamphetamine is overtaking heroin as the production drug of choice in the area and is profiting enormously from the distribution networks that heroin trafficking has already established .
Five percent of Thailand 's population is now estimated to abuse methamphetamine .
The International Narcotics Control Bureau says the figure makes it the largest per capita consumer in the world .
The drug has been around in other forms for years .
It was first used in the 1920 s as an antidepressant and then as a psychostimulant during World War II and the Vietnam War .
People recruited from impoverished ethnic minorities transport the pills along a multitude of routes .
Myanmar soldiers and Thai police and bureaucrats protect the cargo and allow them to eventually reach consumers in Thailand .
The books states that one pill will pass through seven intermediaries from the frontier runner to the retailer .
The retailer will usually sell more to the drug user than he or she requires .
This creates another dealer and explains the drug 's easy availability across Thailand .
Owners of boats in the southern coastal province of Ranong and construction foremen in Bangkok are known to force their workers to take the drug at the beginning of the workday .
Occasionally in rural areas the farmers dissolve the drug in a bottle which they drink while working .
Consumers are as young as seven and school has become one of the main hubs for trafficking of methamphetamine .
Thailand 's youth are the most at risk .

Most of the attacks are carried out by Pakistan @-@ based former Taliban members sent into Afghanistan and funded by drug smuggling operations or supporters in Pakistan .
On 03 April 2003 Afghanistan 's Interior Minister Ali Ahmad Jalali stated that Taliban and remaining al-Qaeda militants are not capable of destabilizing the Afghan government despite their increased attacks on government and foreign targets .
Jalali was speaking at his first press conference since taking office in February 2003 .
Jalali stated that the arrival of spring weather was the reason for the increased number of attacks by Taliban and remaining members of Osama bin Laden 's al-Qaeda network .
The traditional fighting season in Afghanistan is spring after the harsh winters .
Jalali stated that due to the warmer spring weather terrorist activities have increased particularly in the south and southeast regions of Afghanistan .
On 02 April 2003 the U.S. State Department stated that security in Afghanistan was volatile and unpredictable following a series of attacks against foreigners .
In a travel advisory the U.S. State Department stated that travel in all areas of Afghanistan including the capital Kabul is unsafe due to military operations , land mines , banditry , armed rivalry among political and tribal groups , and the possibility of terrorist attacks including attacks using vehicular or other bombs .
Taliban and al-Qaeda militants regularly launch attacks on government and foreign targets .
Last week a foreign Red Cross worker was murdered and 2 U.S. special forces were killed in an ambush while on patrol .
Jalali stated --
On 03 April 2003 Afghan militia forces were fighting Taliban extremists for the 3 rd day near Spin Boldak in southern Kandahar province near the Pakistani border .
There are approximately 50 @-@ 60 terrorists in the mountains of the southern Kandahar province and the Kandahar security forces are conducting operations against them .
On 02 April 2003 2 members of the security forces were killed and 1 was wounded .
7 of the terrorists were arrested .
Several former Taliban members were arrested in another operation in southern Ghazni province .
Jalali stated that among the former Taliban members arrested were several well @-@ known former Taliban figures who were in Afghanistan to establish a network of terrorist organizations and to conduct anti @-@ government activities in the area .
Among those arrested was former Taliban Education Minister Shaheed Kheil .
Jalali stated --
Approximately 15 suspected Taliban members were captured in Kandahar and 9 killed in operations launched after the 27 March 2003 murder of the Red Cross worker .
Most of the terrorist attacks are carried out by former Taliban members based across the border in Pakistan .
These members have confessed that they were sent from Pakistan into Afghanistan by the former Taliban leader .
The Pakistan @-@ based former Taliban members conducting the attacks were being funded by former drug smuggling operations or by supporters in Pakistan .
The militants coming across the border from Pakistan into Afghanistan are organized by former Taliban elements .
Funds are transferred to the Pakistan @-@ based former Taliban members from Karachi , Quetta and Peshawar but this does not indicate that the Government of Pakistan is supporting the former Taliban .
It is true that the interrogated Afghan Taliban stated that they had come from Pakistan and received their financial support from Karachi and Quetta but this does not indicate that the Government of Pakistan is supporting them .

A purported Ayman al-Zawahiri recording called for more suicide attacks , highlighting again the role of Egyptians in al-Qaeda , while suspicions grow that another Egyptian , Seif al @-@ Adel , may have been behind the bombings in Saudi Arabia .
In a message aired 030521 by Arabic Qatar 's Al-Jazeera satellite channel , the purported voice of Ayman al-Zawahiri urged Muslims to force Westerners out of Muslim lands by attacking westerners and emulating the 010911 suicide attacks in the United States .
The speaker called for Muslims to muster their resolve and hit the embassies of America , England , Australia and Norway , and strike at the interests , companies and employees of America , England , Australia and Norway .
The speaker urged Muslims to attack and eject Americans , British , Australians and Norwegians out of Muslim homelands .
The speaker told Muslims not to allow Americans , British , Australians , Norwegians or other Western Christians to live in and benefit from the resources of Muslim countries .
Egyptian experts said this audiotape was a genuine recording of Zawahiri 's voice and proved Zawahiri was alive and still as influential as before in al-Qaeda .
Montasser al @-@ Zayat , a lawyer who has represented Islamic militant suspects in Egypt , stated he was certain that the voice on the tape was that of Zawahiri , Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden 's top lieutenant .
Al @-@ Zayat stated that the recording was Zawahiri 's voice , style and manner .
Dia al @-@ Rashwan stated that he believed that the voice was Zawahiri 's and that the message bore Zawahiri 's characteristic emphasis on Islamic militant attacks against Arab governments which are allied to the United States .
Al @-@ Rashwan is a journalist with Egypt 's government daily Al @-@ Ahram and an expert on Islamic militants .
According to Rashwan , while bin Laden has always stressed international targets , Zawahiri has gradually shown increasing support for Arab targets as well .
Rashwan thought it was clear that Zawahiri is still second in command of al-Qaeda and that his stress on local ( Arab ) targets was influencing not only statements and actions by Al-Qaeda itself but also groups inspired by them .
Montasser al @-@ Zayat said that he believed bin Laden was under secure protection with Zawahiri .
Zayat thought that security conditions sometimes dictate which one speaks out .
The situations and locations of Zawahiri , bin Laden and other top al-Qaeda members have been unknown since the United States struck the bases of al-Qaeda and its Taliban supporters in Afghanistan in 011000 .
Rashwan was unable to illuminate suspicions that Seif al @-@ Adel , another Egyptian , might have masterminded the triple suicide bombings that killed 34 people , including 9 bombers , in Riyadh , Suadi Arabia 030512 .
Rashwan and other Egyptian experts said that Adel has become Al-Qaeda 's number 3 in command since becoming chief of military operations and succeeding Abu Hafs al @-@ Masri .
Al @-@ Masri was killed during the war in Afghanistan .
Adel was a top member in the Egyptian Islamic militant movement Al @-@ Jihad .
Al @-@ Jihad was led by Zawahiri and carried out many attacks in Egypt in the 1990 s .
Adel left Egypt at the end of the 1980 s for a Gulf Arab country , then traveled to Pakistan and then Afghanistan , where he helped train militants at some camps , Egyptian sources said on condition they not be named .
The Egyptian sources also said that Adel is close to both Zawahiri and bin Laden .
A senior Saudi official said 030519 that he believed Adel directed the bombings in Riyadh .
A senior United States official stated that it was still not clear whether Adel had personally been involved .
Like Zawahiri , Adel and Al @-@ Masri were on a list of 12 most wanted suspects released by the US administration following the 010911 attacks .
At least three other Egyptians were also on the list @: Tharwat Salah Shehata , Tariq Anwar As @-@ Sayyid Ahmad and Mohammad Salah .

Ahmad and Salah were believed to have organized suicide attacks .

Indian troops already fighting rebels in Kashmir are now engaged in a massive campaign to destroy poppy crops in the region .
Troops are facing angry farmers unaware that poppy cultivation is now punishable as a drug trafficking offense .
Indian troops already fighting rebels are now also engaged in a massive operation to destroy poppy crops in Kashmir .
Customs officials from the Federal Finance Ministry launched the campaign with security forces on 15 May 2003 in the southern Kashmir already affected by much violence .
The campaign requires troops to confront angry residents desperate to earn a living and unaware they are violating the law .
Senior Customs Officer V. Prabhakar stated that in 2003 the troops have destroyed opium poppy crops dispersed over 224.73 hectares ( 556 acres ) in 27 villages of Anantnag and Pulwama districts .
A similar drive was carried out in 2002 in the same region but did not stop residents from replanting .
Prabhakar stated --
The crop destruction of 2002 has not served as a deterrent .
The State administration has been lax on the issue .
No district official has ever taken steps to destroy the crop nor even reported that poppy crops are grown in his area .
Villagers in this region approximately 30 kilometers ( 18 miles ) south of Kashmir 's summer capital Srinagar stated that cultivating poppy crops was their only livelihood .
Farmer Ghulam Ahmed stated that he and other farmers have been growing poppy crops in their fields for years with no objection from anyone .
Ahmed stated that residents were shocked when officials and troops started destroying their harvest .
Many villagers grow poppy for their seeds used to flavor the Kashmiri bread known as kulcha .
Kulcha is always in great demand across the Himalayan region .
Bakers buy the seeds at 100 rupees ( two U.S. dollars ) per kilogram .
The lucrative byproduct is poppy SAP which can be processed into opium .
Rahti Begum was disconsolate as she watched her crop being destroyed .
Begum who raises the 3 children of her late son stated that her poppy crop is her only source of income .
Some officials admit the residents are not at fault .
A State official told AFP --
These villagers are innocent .
They cultivate the crop for poppy seeds unaware that its cultivation is punishable .
The villagers are inadvertently involving themselves in drug trafficking .
Officials state that because many farmers are unaware of these laws security forces make no arrests over poppy cultivation .
Prabhakar states --
If the cultivation continues unrestrained Kashmir may soon become notorious for narcotics .
This has potential serious consequences as Kashmiri youth may become addicted to narcotics grown in the region .
Poppy cultivation at present is largely organized by groups who use their own trucks to transport the drugs for sale in other parts of India .
In 2002 the Indian army seized 350 kilograms ( 772 pounds ) of narcotics in the Kashmir Valley .
He will intensify the anti @-@ drug operation .
Federal and state officials and non @-@ governmental organizations should cooperate on the anti @-@ drug campaign and could end the poppy trade in Kashmir .
A crucial element of the campaign 's success is education of the public .
The region of Kashmir is already unstable from 14 years of the separatist violence that has killed 10 s of 1000 s of people and has devastated their once prosperous tourism industry .

The Chinese government 's recent conclusion that North Korea has enough plutonium to build a nuclear bomb has resulted in urgent diplomacy and plans for new talks .
Chinese deputy foreign minister was dispatched to North Korea to meet with Kim Jong @-@ Il in an attempt to deescalate the situation .
Chinese diplomats were quoted in the Asian Wall Street Journal on 18 July 2003 as stating that China believes North Korea currently has enough plutonium to build a nuclear bomb .
This belief caused the Government of China to accelerate diplomacy to resolve the crisis and to dispatch Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo to Pyongyang , North Korea on 12 July 2003 in this effort .
China is North Korea 's closest ally .
North Korea is a Stalinist regime .
Dai is presently in Washington D.C. to inform top U.S. policymakers of the outcome of the rare meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong @-@ Il .
The newspaper stated that in recent weeks Chinese intelligence services concluded that North Korea is producing weapons @-@ grade plutonium in sufficient quantities and possesses all the necessary components to assemble nuclear @-@ tipped missiles .
A European official familiar with internal Chinese reports on the findings and Chinese diplomats were quoted in the newspaper as stating that the reprocessed plutonium is estimated to be sufficient to make at least 1 nuclear device .
The European official stated that North Korea has yet to combine the plutonium , triggering devices and other components into a bomb .
The Chinese reports in part verify recent claims made by the Government of North Korea that a number of spent nuclear fuel rods sealed in 1994 have been opened and have undergone reprocessing ostensibly to produce plutonium .
Until now China had stated that no evidence existed that North Korea was seeking nuclear weapons .
The U.S. government has been unable to confirm the North Korean government 's claims .
U.S. and South Korean officials have speculated that North Korea may have 1 or 2 nuclear bombs and may have the capacity to build 6 .
The Chinese government 's increasing concern was made evident by the new urgency of its diplomacy this week .
At a foreign ministry briefing on 17 July 2003 spokesman Kong Quan stated that the North Korean crisis was at a critical point .
Kong Quan stated that China is attempting to deescalate the situation by promoting talks and encouraging the 2 parties to make peace .
Kong Quan stated that it is important that the parties return to negotiations and continue with the trilateral talks that commenced in April 2003 .
The trilateral talks of April ended poorly with the North Korean government stating it possessed and might test nuclear weapons .
According to U.S. officials there is now a greater possibility that new talks could occur as North Korea appears willing to join another negotiating session with China and the United States .
There were also indications that the dialogue could be expanded to include Japan and South Korea .
South Korean officials have been quoted as saying that a dialogue could take place as early as August 2003 .
The United States government has always insisted on multilateral talks and has been eager to include its Japanese and South Korean allies .
North Korea has consistently demanded 1-on-1 talks with the U.S. government .
The Government of China emphasizes that it is more important to resume talks quickly than to refrain until the number of participants can be agreed upon .
China is a traditional ally and supplier of food and fuel to North Korea China and is therefore the country with the most leverage over North Korea .
China has demonstrated that it is willing to take advantage of this leverage .
Earlier in the crisis China stopped oil supplies to North Korea for several days .
2 days after North Korean leader Kim Jong @-@ Il granted Dai the rare meeting for 14 July 2003 the regime 's Korean Central News Agency announced that China had recently decided to donate 10000 tons of diesel oil to North Korea .

Thailand will host ministers from China , Laos , India and Myanmar to discuss the elimination of precursor chemicals used in drug production .
Officials report that ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will hold talks this week in the northern Thai town of Chiang Rai aimed at eliminating precursor chemicals used in drug production .
The meeting will take place from 22 July 2003 - 25 July 2003 in one of the corners of the Golden Triangle and is the first of its kind .
The meeting will be attended by the ministers responsible for drug suppression in China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand .
Thai Justice Minister pongthep Thepkanjana will host the meeting .
Deputy chief of Thailand 's office of Narcotics Control Board ( ONCB ) rasanee Vistaveth stated the ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand are expected to adopt the Chiang Rai Declaration which will touch on the countries @' commitment to solving the problem of drugs , particularly with regard to precursors and chemical trafficking .
Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are contained in legal medicines and are used to produce illegal stimulants including speed or ice which are produced in large quantities in Myanmar and then trafficked to Thailand and China and beyond .
Chemical precursors are also used to turn raw opium into heroin .
Rasanee stated the ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand expect to openly discuss their countries @' weak points and the measures each country is taking to control these substances and prevent the substances from reaching the Golden Triangle area .
Rasanee said the governments of China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will explore ways to cooperate to intercept the illegal substances which are also used in legitimate industries .
Rasanee stated every country has its own way of controlling precursors but as matter of fact many precursors still flood the Golden Triangle area .
The ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will also address crop substitution initiatives for impoverished ethnic minorities who still rely on opium cultivation .
Rasanee referred to Thailand 's successful decades @-@ long campaign to eliminate poppy growing from its territory and reported that Thailand is willing to help and share its own expertise on opium elimination by training officials .
The ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will discuss how to find markets for goods produced under crop substitution and other related programs such as eco @-@ tourism and handicraft manufacturing .

La times probe finds strong evidence that Iran appears to be in the late stages of developing the capacity to build a nuclear bomb .
The Los Angeles Times in the 030804 edition Summarized results of an independent probe which strongly indicated that Iran is striving to become the world 's next nuclear power and appears to be in the late stages of developing the capacity to build a nuclear bomb .
The Los Angeles Times said the 3 @-@ month investigation drew on previously secret reports , international officials , independent experts , Iranian exiles and intelligence sources and uncovered strong evidence that Iran 's commercial program masked a military undertaking .
The Times report said that scientists from Russia , China , North Korea and Pakistan plus advancing technology have propelled Iran 's nuclear program much closer to producing a bomb than Iraq ever was .
The Times pointed out that some experts predict Iran might produce an initial atomic weapon in the next 2 @-@ 3 years .
No one is certain about the actual time frame for Iran 's nuclear weapon production .
Nuclear materials @:
The Times said a confidential report prepared by the French Government in 030500 concluded that Iran is surprisingly close to having enriched uranium or plutonium for a bomb .
A foreign intelligence service provided a copy of the report to the times .
The French government warned other governments in the report to exercise the most serious vigilance on their exports to Iran and Iranian front companies .
The Times report said that samples of uranium taken by UN inspectors in Iran in 030600 tested positive for enrichment levels high enough to be consistent with an attempt to build a nuclear weapon .
The Iranian government also secretly imported 1.8 tons of nuclear material from China in 910000 and processed some of this nuclear material in order to manufacture uranium metal .
This uranium would be of no use in Iran 's commercial program but would be integral to weapons production .
foreign scientists @' involvement @:
The Times quoted an unnamed Middle Eastern intelligence official that Pakistan 's role was bigger than thought from the beginning .
Abdul Qadeer Khan has helped Iran for years and is a Pakistani nuclear scientist regarded by the United States as a purveyor of nuclear secrets .
The Times said people inside Iran and foreign intelligence officials say that North Korean military scientists had been recently monitored entering Iranian nuclear facilities and are assisting in the design of a nuclear warhead .
There is a resort on the Caspian coast set aside for the exclusive use of North Koreans who are working on nuclear and missile projects in Iran .
This indicates the number of North Koreans working in Iran on such projects .
Russian scientists sometimes travel to Iran under false identities and work without the Russian government 's approval to help complete a special reactor that could produce weapons @-@ grade plutonium .
New technology @:
The report said Iranians have also approached European companies in recent months to buy devices that can manipulate large volumes of radioactive material .
This technology is for forging uranium metal and plutonium and switches that could trigger a nuclear weapon .
European intelligence sources said list of items the Iranians have wished to procure was a strong indication that Iran has moved to the late stages of weapons development .

Iran pledges to provide nuclear information to IAEA and sign nuclear protocol before 20040200 but not to indefinitely suspend uranium enrichment
20031129 Secretary of Iran 's Supreme National Security Council and senior Iranian nuclear official Hassan Rowhani stated --
By 20040200 when director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency of the UN Mohammed El @-@ Baradei presents a new report Iran will provide all required information and means of verification to the IAEA .
The Iranian government will soon authorize its representative to the IAEA to sign the additional protocol to the Non @-@ Proliferation Treaty .
20031126 the IAEA passed a resolution condemning Iran for 18 years of covert nuclear activities .
The resolution contained a passage warning that any further non @-@ proliferation breaches by Iran would occasion stern action .
The US demanded that the Iranian government be brought before the UN Security Council for possible sanctions while Britain , France and Germany demanded that Iran be rewarded for cooperating with the IAEA since 20031000 but neither demand was met by the resolution .
Prior to 20031129 Rowhani had made no statement after the 20031126 IAEA resolution .
Rowhani stated --
The suspension of uranium enrichment is provisional and voluntary and intended to build confidence .
Iran continues to refuse to indefinitely suspend its uranium enrichment activities and reserves the right to recommence enrichment at any moment .
Iran 's uranium enrichment has prompted international concern that Iran may be capable of constructing an atomic bomb .
Iran stated that the purpose its nuclear activities is peaceful .
Rowhani stated that Iran wants to use enriched uranium to supply fuel for a future civil center .
Rowhani stated that the Iranian government will discuss with European governments the transfer of modern technology , nuclear technology and fuel to Iran .
An unprecedented mission by the foreign ministers of Britain , France and Germany in 20031000 convinced the Iranian government to --
Declare the entirety of the country 's nuclear activities .
Suspend uranium enrichment .
Sign the NPT additional protocol allowing stricter inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities .

Live poultry smuggling undermines WHO and FAO efforts to restrict bird flu spread in Asia .
FAO and WHO advise countries to tighten border security .
Smugglers are undermining international efforts headed by the UN World Health Organization ( WHO ) and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) to eradicate bird flu by trafficking illegal live poultry that threaten to spread the disease to new areas .
Attempts to halt bird flu spread --
Agriculture and customs officials have increased border checks throughout the affected region to halt illicit trade .
Recent arrests of live poultry smugglers have occurred at checkpoints .
Most affected Asian countries have banned the import and export of live and slaughtered poultry to prevent the movement of potentially infected chickens and ducks across borders .
Senior FAO Animal Production and Health Officer in Asia Hans Wagner stated --
The FAO is concerned and well aware that there is copious uncontrolled movement of animals between borders in some Asian countries .
Smuggling occurs chiefly across the Green or uncontrolled borders of Vietnam , Laos , Thailand , Cambodia , Myanmar and China is likely a source for spreading the flu and other diseases .
Authorities in Vietnam stated that smuggling of meat and fruit from China has increased drastically in the past year .
Vietnam has experienced 9 flu fatalities and is the country worst affected by the disease .
Preventing smuggling from Vietnam is difficult because the country 's extensive land borders with China , Laos and Cambodia are poorly controlled by a notoriously corrupt customs department .
Most nations have tightened border controls in accordance with FAO and WHO advisories .
20040120 Cambodian authorities detained 10 in the southern province of Ta KEO for importing over 150000 duck eggs from Vietnam .
Cambodia has continuously been combating chicken and egg smuggling from Vietnam and is on high alert .
20040202 Taiwan tightened security against smugglers following the discovery in 20031200 of H5N1 in ducks smuggled from mainland China .
Taiwan has previously successfully controlled an outbreak of the milder H5N2 flu strain .
Taiwanese coastguards increased patrols around the island and several island groups off the Chinese mainland .
Approximately 8000 poultry and pig farmers were vaccinated against human flu to prevent it mutating with bird flu strains .
India is free of the disease but has deployed hundreds of soldiers to the border with Myanmar .
Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases but Indian officials suspect that poultry could be smuggled through Myanmar from Thailand .
Thailand is one of the countries worst affected by the virus .
Hong Kong authorities have increased security along the border with China .
The Government stated that illegally slaughtered poultry imports increased by 15 percent from 2002 to 2003 .
The Customs and Excise Department reportedly seized 29266 kilograms of chilled or frozen poultry in 2003 compared with 1749 kilograms in 2002 .
Customs spokesman Richard law stated that the Department performs frequent checks on smuggling activities and have now increased efforts to inspect cargoes .
The H5N1 flu strain has caused 13 deaths and reported outbreaks in 10 countries .

The China Business Post reported 040209 that German auto giant Volkswagen AG had decided against the further transfer of a technical platform for the Santana sedan model to joint venture partner Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp ( SAIC ) .
Discontinuing these technology transfers would cause several millions of yuan 's of losses to SAIC .
The China Business Post said SAIC had invested large sums in the scheduled acquisition of the Platform , including acquiring an auto manufacturing plant in Yizheng city in eastern Jiangsu province .
The reported plan was for SAIC to produce a new sedan model designed on the Santana platform and with the car set to be launched in 040500 .
The China Business Post said the termination was due in part to Volkswagen 's adjustment of strategies regarding China and to ineffective communication with Volkswagen 's Chinese partners .
Volkswagen on 040209 rejected this China Business Post report that Volkswagen had put a stop to technology transfers of Santana sedans to SAIC .
Volkswagen group China spokeswoman Melanie Behrens said that the statements made in the China Business Post about the stop of knowledge transfer from VW to SAIC are not true .
Behrens said that Volkswagen does not know where these claims came from and is still working on the subject and trying to clarify the situation .
SAIC was not immediately available for comment .

French anti @-@ terrorist judge calls terrorism serious threat despite dispersal and weakening of al-Qaeda .
Restraining extremist groups is becoming increasingly difficult because of how the groups are financed .
France 's top anti @-@ terrorist judge Jean @-@ Louis Bruguiere stated to AFP 29 February 2004 that al-Qaeda is still capable of inspiring people to carry out attacks despite being much weaker since the 11 September 2001 attacks and the U.S. @-@ led war in Afghanistan .
Bruguiere has led the French legal effort against extremism and terrorism in recent years .
Bruguiere stated --
The global fight against terrorism is against an increasingly elusive enemy with access to funds virtually impossible to control .
The threat comes from long @-@ standing members of al-Qaeda .
Al-Qaeda is an organization which still exists but has been significantly weakened by the neutralization and capture of a number of its members and of those in charge .
In an interview in Monaco Bruguiere called global terrorism a scattered and polymorphous threat .
Bruguiere was in Monaco attending a meeting of the international organization involved in Mediterranean political studies called club of Monaco .
Dozens of alleged members of al-Qaeda have been captured or killed since the group claimed responsibility for the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington D.C. but authorities have not been able to locate al-Qaeda 's leader Osama bin Laden or his top deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri .
On 24 February 2004 Zawahiri appeared in 2 taped messages broadcast by the Arab @-@ language Al @-@ Arabiya and Al-Jazeera television stations calling in remarks attributed to him for renewed attacks on the United States .
Bruguiere stated --
Restraining extremist groups particularly across Europe was becoming increasingly difficult because of how the groups are financed .
The networks operating in Europe benefit from micro @-@ financing and not from macro @-@ financing .
Fraudulent charge cards could be used to withdraw significant sums which are then distributed through micro @-@ channels outside the classic financial circles and are practically impossible to detect .
Use of false credit cards is growing .
It is necessary to expand existing laws to combat the funding mechanisms .
All existing legal or institutional measures are insufficient to neutralize this threat .
Al-Qaeda is only 1 of many worldwide threats among the many radical Islamic organizations involved in an international jihad and sharing the al-Qaeda strategy that are pursuing regional options .
The groups are particularly active in Africa , Asia and Europe .
Bruguiere made these comments before going into a meeting with approximately 40 high @-@ ranking or former top international officials .
Since the September 2001 strikes on the United States deadly large-scale attacks have occurred in other parts of the world .
Among the targets have been a synagogue in northern Tunisia , a nightclub in Bali , a hotel in Kenya and numerous locations in Chechnya and Russia .
Analysts have warned that Iraq could become a breeding ground for terrorist organizations if a political solution is not found soon .

Amnesty International urges Laos to treat surrendered ethnic Hmong rebels humanely while Lao officials claim there are no rebels and no insurgency .
The rights group states that Lao troops promised rebels amnesty and a living area if they surrender but has received conflicting reports as to whether the Lao Government has upheld this agreement .
On 05 March 2004 Amnesty International called on the Lao Government to ensure that 100 s of ethnic Hmong anti @-@ government insurgents and their families who had reportedly surrendered were treated humanely .
From its London headquarters Amnesty International issued a statement saying that the Lao People 's Democratic Republic has international obligations in this regard under the Geneva Conventions and the 2 UN covenants .
On 03 March 2004 the U.S. government @-@ funded network Radio Free Asia reported --
Up to 700 insurgents and their relatives and 8 rebel commanders surrendered after government troops surrounded several northern holdouts in late February 2004 .
Troops used leaflets and megaphones to help communicate to the rebels that authorities would grant them amnesty and a special living area if they surrendered .
Approximately 300 people surrendered near Luang Prabang after traveling on foot from farther north and between 300 and 400 people surrendered in Xieng Khouang province .
Amnesty International stated it had received conflicting reports as to their reception and treatment by the authorities .
Lao Foreign Ministry Spokesman Yong Chanthalangsy denied that anyone had surrendered insisting also that there were no rebels in the impoverished communist nation .
Yong Chanthalangsy told AFP that no one surrendered , that there are no rebels and there is no war in Laos .
Yong Chanthalangsy stated that there are many people coming out of the forests to take advantage of Lao poverty eradication programs .
Following a series of deadly highway ambushes and bomb blasts the Lao Government called in August 2003 on Hmong and others whom they called ethnic minority bandits to lay down their arms , to come out from the forest and to rejoin society .
The Lao Government warned that failure to do so would result in heavy consequences .
Small bands of ethnic minority rebels predominantly Hmong remain from the CIA @-@ sponsored guerrilla army mobilized to wage the United States @' secret campaign in Laos during the Vietnam War .
Some 300000 Hmong fled to Thailand after the Communist takeover in Laos in 1975 but the remaining rebels have continued a low @-@ level , ineffective insurgency for nearly three decades .
The Lao military has been accused by human rights groups of using harsh and often brutal tactics to eliminate them .
Amnesty International called on the Lao Government to provide UN agencies and other non @-@ governmental organizations access to all those who have put down their arms in order to assist with basic humanitarian needs .
Amnesty International stated --
Longer term assistance with their reintegration into Lao society will also be needed .
It is essential that neutral observers are given access to these groups of former rebels in order to independently assess their situation and the veracity of ongoing claims of serious human rights violations being made by overseas ethnic Hmong groups .
The Lao Government should seize this opportunity to find a peaceful solution to decades of fighting and the high human cost on all sides of the conflict .
In January 2004 , U.S. @-@ based Lao exiles warned that Lao forces had launched a new offensive against 1000 s of Hmong rebels and civilians and accused the communist regime of using starvation as a weapon of war .

Albania ( al )
International ; Government ; crime
Desiring admission into the European Union , Albanian government increased efforts against drug trafficking by strengthening laws , seizing illegal drugs , and investigating possibly corrupt police officials .
Under the pressure of the European Union the Albanian Government has escalated its fight against drug trafficking by preparing a new strategy to halt the smuggling of hashish and heroin over Albanian territory from Asia towards the West .
A recent EU report on Albania stated the situation in Albania , which has remained an important country for the traffic of narcotics , is worrisome .
The report suggested the Tirana government adopt an efficient strategy in the Government 's efforts against drug trafficking .
Albanian interior minister Igli Toska stated --
The fight against drug trafficking will be the Albanian government 's main challenge in 2004 .
The Albanian Government has been working on a project of national strategy which will require international support and cooperation .
Albania 's geographic position , Albania 's trade with Turkey and Greece , and the situation after the Kosovo war are all elements Albanian criminal groups profit from , thereby making Albania an important stop for the transit of narcotics .
In July 2004 the Albanian government plans to present a set of anti @-@ Mafia laws which will allow confiscation of property belonging to persons involved in criminal and illegal activities .
Albanian justice minister Adrian dvorani stated the anti @-@ Mafia laws also provide for the special protection of witnesses or people involved in illegal trafficking who decide to testify and will enable a more efficient strategy .
Albanian officials aspire to EU membership .
The Albanian government has made a significant development in the government 's fight against drug smugglers in 2004 .
In 2003 Albanian police infiltrated an international drug network operating between Kosovo , Macedonia , Albania and Italy and controlled by the Kosovo Albanian and Turkish criminal groups linked with the Calabrian Mafia organization N'Drangheta .
In May 2004 approximately 100 policemen -- 25 of them in top positions -- were dismissed on suspected ties with organized crime .
60 others have been investigated on similar charges .
Toska stated there will be no smugglers without corrupted policemen and Toska announced tougher measures against policemen and security officials linked with criminal groups .
The EU report quotes the names of several Albanian politicians directly or indirectly involved in drugs trafficking but no measures have so far been taken against the politicians .
Albanian police forces have seized more than 200 kilos ( 440 pounds ) of heroin and around 8 tons of cannabis between November 2003 and May 2004 , double that which was seized in 2003 .
Experts say the figures of drugs seized are insignificant compared to the estimated quantities of narcotics that are smuggled through Albania .
International Police experts based in Tirana estimate the value of the narcotics in transit at over 2 billion dollars ( about 1.6 billion euros ) per year .
Experts estimate the amount smuggled through Albania makes up approximately 25 to 30 percent of the narcotics smuggled into the European market from the Balkans .
Albanian police official Xhavit Shala stated Albanian smugglers are linked to the international criminal organizations like ( the Italian ) sacra Corona UNITA , Cosa Nostra , the Turkish , Russian , Macedonian and Kosovar mafia , and the Colombian drug cartels .
Bujar Mema of the Albanian Interpol Office stated that drug smugglers have reappeared due to increasing consumption of narcotics in Europe and the production of opium from Afghanistan , which has reached the level of the years before the US intervention in 2001 with 3600 tons produced in 2003 .

UMC Chairman Robert Tsao said the company had submitted a letter to Taiwan 's Investment Commission asking for assistance in transferring the stake .
It said it was compensation for previous assistance .
UMC manufactures cutting-edge microchips .
The chips are installed in a wide range of computers and electronics found in mobile phones , televisions and cars .
The technology is highly prized in Taiwan .
Market analysts believe the assistance involved a technology transfer from UMC to hejian and the compensation through the stake represents a payment .
No cash changed hands .
Tsao said the letter followed a verbal promise made by hejian technology to pay UMC a reasonable amount of compensation .
That included a commitment to merge the two companies .
Tsao said no formal written agreements had been signed .
Both companies would next seek a strategic partnership if the Investment Commission approved the deal .
UMC is the world 's second largest wafer foundry and has recognized its investment in hejian which had previously been denied .
Taiwan authorities lifted a ban in March 2002 on mainland @-@ bound investment in eight @-@ inch ( 200 millimeter ) silicon wafer plants .
This followed assurances from potential investors that the island would not lose out on transferred technology .
Prosecutors raided the homes and offices of UMC executives in February 2005 as part of a probe into the alleged illegal supply of funds , technology and human resources to hejian .
Hejian was founded in November 2001 with capital of 350 million U.S. dollars .
Its Chairman Hsu Chien @-@ hua has been barred from leaving Taiwan after being bailed out of police custody for 10 million Taiwan dollars .
Tsao and UMC vice chairman John hsuan have also been named as defendants in on @-@ going investigations .
UMC has never sought government approval for China @-@ bound investments .
The company has previously called hejian technology a friendly company while denying any financial ties between the two .

5 projects worth 10.6 million dollars are currently in operation under an action plan implemented as part of the 1993 pact with UNDOC .
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen opened the meeting and stated --
Regional cross @-@ border crime flourishes due to increasingly open borders and more amicable economic and social relations among countries in the region .
Producing and trafficking illegal drugs is only 1 aspect of organized transnational crime .
Money Laundering is a particular concern for the Mekong Sub @-@ region because this money will fund terrorist activities .
Cambodia is considered an increasingly important trans @-@ shipment point for illicit drugs in the region .

On June 3 , 2005 Israeli military officials stated in the New York Times that Syria test fired three Scud missiles a week ago in an act of defiance to the United States and the United Nations .
One of the missiles broke up over two Turkish villages .
It caused no injuries .
The officials stated the missile tests were normal .
It was Syria 's first since 2001 and caused embarrassment to Turkey .
Syria decided to make the missile tests public because the U.S. silence about them was unsettling .
The Israeli officials in Tel Aviv told the daily that the missile tests were part of a Syrian missile development project using North Korean technology .
The three missiles were the older Scud B that has a range of 300 kilometers ( 185 miles ) and two Scud D 's with a range of 700 kilometers ( 435 miles ) .
The missiles are designed to deliver air @-@ burst chemical weapons .
The official said the launchings on May 27 , 2003 were Syrian President Bashir al @-@ Assad 's response to U.S. and UN pressures that forced al @-@ Assad to withdraw Syrian troops from neighboring Lebanon .
This was in the wake of the February assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Harari .
A senior Israeli military official said the tests are probably needed for the missile project but Bashir is taking a risk and sending a message .
Anti @-@ Syrian journalist Samir kassir was killed June 2 , 2005 when a bomb exploded under kassir 's car in Beirut .
The attack is blamed on the pro @-@ Syrian regime and widely condemned at home and abroad .

The Israeli officials said the Syrian missiles were launched from northern Syria Newar minakh .
One was sent about 400 kilometers ( 250 miles ) to southernmost Syria near the Jordanian border .
The missile that that broke up was launched southwest toward the Mediterranean , over the Turkish province of Hatay and shed debris over two villages there .
The Israelis said they had film of the launching and breakup .

The China Times stated that the Hsiung Feng cruise missile was developed by the military @-@ run chungshan Institute of Science and Technology , has a range of 1,000 kilometers ( 600 miles ) and could be used to attack military bases in southeast China .
The China Times stated that once the missile was deployed it would mark the first time that Taiwan is able to put strategic weapons into use and that the political and military impact of this would be far @-@ reaching .
The Times said Defense Minister Lee jye witnessed the test firing of the missile from chiupeng military base in the southern Pingtung County and that the missile flew over 500 kilometers ( 300 miles ) before hitting its target .
The defense ministry declined to comment on the report .
The report did not specify when the test took place but speculated that it could have been in March .
The missile is expected to go into pilot production later in 050000 or 060000 .

Brazilian government and Abbott Laboratories agree on lower price for AIDS drug Kaletra in response to Brazilian threat to violate the patent .
According to WHO studies the price of the drug was exorbitant and the Brazilian government demanded that Abbot lower the price .
On 08 July 2005 Brazil 's Ministry of Health stated that U.S. company Abbott Laboratories has agreed to reduce the price of its HIV/AIDS drug Kaletra to prevent Brazil from violating the company 's patent as it had threatened .
The ministry said in a statement --
The agreement made with Abbott guarantees the Ministry 's proposed objectives ensuring a significant price cut for the drug over the next 6 years .
Abbott agreed to a technology transfer procedure so that Brazil 's state @-@ run farmanguinhos laboratories can begin producing Kaletra in 2009 .
The agreement guarantees access to Meltrex by Brazilian patients .
Meltrex is an updated version of Kaletra that is pending approval by U.S. health authorities .
Over the 6 years which the Agreement covers Brazil expects to save up to 259 million U.S. dollars in drug purchases .
The Ministry recently stated that an agreement with Abbott would save Brazil 18 million U.S. dollars in its 2006 budget to provide AIDS patients free anti @-@ AIDS treatment consisting of a cocktail of anti @-@ retroviral drugs including Kaletra .
Currently 24000 patients in Brazil receive Kaletra .
The number is expected to increase to 60000 by 2011 .
On 24 June 2005 Brazil declared Kaletra a drug of national interest and demanded that Abbott decide within 10 days to either agree to lower its price for the drug or face a violation of its patent .
On 24 June 2005 Brazilian Health Minister Humberto Costa stated that the price paid by the Brazilian Government to purchase Kaletra represented a yearly cost of 2630 U.S. dollars per patient .
Costa stated that this price is considered exorbitant because studies of the World Health Organization ( WTO ) showed that for large-scale production the fair price including a considerable margin of profit should range from 480 to 540 U.S. dollars per patient per year .
Costa stated that Brazil planned to have a less expensive generic copy of the patented drug produced locally by a state @-@ owned company .

Pakistani analysts say that Pakistan 's network of madrassas has close links with Islamic extremists in Britain , who supply them with extremist recruits and funding .
Pakistani analysts said on 050715 that Pakistan 's network of madrassa Islamic schools has close links with Islamic extremists in Britain , who supply them with extremist recruits and vital funding .
On 050714 British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw expressed concern over what goes on in some Pakistani madrassas .
It has emerged that Shehzad Tanweer was one of the terrorists who carried out the bombing of an underground subway train at Aldgate in east London .
Tanweer was said by his uncle to have gone in 041200 to a Pakistani madrassa , wanting to learn to recite the Koran by heart .
Sources in Pakistan said that British authorities should look inside British borders where the South Asian community is turning to increasingly extremist religious views .
Kamila hyat of Pakistan 's Human Rights Commision said that militancy is being exported in the reverse direction .
Younger Pakistanis coming from Britain have very extreme and hard @-@ line views and view British culture as decadent .
When Pakistani @-@ British youngsters come to Pakistan they are surprised to see women walking around without burqas .
Analysts say Tanweer 's trip to Pakistan was by no means unusual , as many Pakistani families who emigrated some 40 or 50 years ago and settled in Britain send their children for religious teaching at madrassas .
Hyat said they want to ensure their children are not alienated from their family faith and hope a brief stint of a few terms will help ground them in Islamic and Pakistani culture .
Hyat said that complaints have nonetheless been received from parents in Pakistan who are very concerned about teenagers who graduate and then go back to the UK for University .
The parents of some madrassa students are saying that the young men are somewhat confused when away from the UK for the first time and are consistently being approached by other Pakistanis or by Arabs who attempt to get them to join extremist groups .
Such students bring extremism back to the UK when coming back home .
Madrassas continue to produce a peculiar state of mind in students , said Hasan Askari .
Askari is the former head of political science department at Lahore 's Punjab University .
Askari said that these students having a state of mind of religious orthodoxy are vulnerable to violence and extremism .
Some of the radical religious schools in Pakistan have thrived on funds regularly coming from supporters among the Muslim community in Britain .
Security sources say that in one case , several thousand pounds were sent to outlawed Sipah-e-Sahaba of Pakistan in 030000 .
Pakistani security officials informed the British authorities and identified the man who sent the money as Mullah Hamid .
Mullah Hamid was a prayer leader in a mosque in Glasgow .
Pakistan admits that some of the estimated 10,000 madrassas in Pakistan are breeding grounds for extremism .
Madrassas have been a part of Muslim social life on the Indian subcontinent for decades .
In the 1980 s they became a recruiting ground for the US @-@ sponsored militant movement against the Soviet occupation of neighboring Afghanistan .
President Pervez Musharraf has been campaigning since early 030000 for reform of madrassas .
Many madrassas are unregulated and the International Crisis Group says 1.5 million students attend such Islamic schools .
Education Minister Javed Ashraf stated on 050715 that efforts were working to get madrassa leaders to broaden the curriculum beyond rote Koranic learning and to encompass useful and employable skills .

Londonistan is the Islamist core operating in London .
The two main components of londonistan are the international Jihad Movement and the exiled opposition to current Arab or Muslim regimes .
Londonistan emerged in the 1990 s because London was a center for finance and Arabic media and because of Britain 's lenient asylum laws .

Foreign Governments opposed the British government 's passive policy .

The epicenter of the 7.6 @-@ magnitude earthquake was in Muzaffarabad and caused damage among the militant groups .
All the terrorist infrastructure in and around Muzaffarabad was destroyed and many innocent people died .
It is premature to state with certainty what impact the earthquake has had on the militant groups as infrastructure remains intact in other areas in Pakistan .
The militant groups are seeking either independence for Kashmir or absorption into Pakistan .

An Australian man was charged in Singapore with drug trafficking .
Singapore 's Central Narcotics Bureau said on 070116 in a statement that Australian Michael Karras was arrested on 070109 after being found in possession of 495 grams of cannabis .
The statement said Karras was subsequently charged for the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug .
Karras faces at least 5 years @' imprisonment and a minimum 5 strokes of the cane if convicted but would escape the death penalty sentence mandatory for anyone caught trafficking more than 500 grams of cannabis .
The arrest of Karras comes more than a year after the highly publicized hanging of Australian Nguyen Tuong van .
Nguyen was executed in 051200 for trying to smuggle 400 grams of heroin via Singapore to Australia in 020000 .
Nguyen 's hanging despite heavy lobbying from the Australian government for Singapore to show clemency triggered public outrage in Australia where capital punishment is outlawed .
Singapore also applies the death sentence to other crimes including murder , treason , kidnapping and firearms offences .

Authorizing of EU sanctions against North Korea meets difficulties due to Britain 's disagreement with Spain over the sovereignty of Gibraltar .
Diplomatic sources said on 070208 that EU sanctions against North Korea can not go forward due to Britain 's disagreement with Spain over the sovereignty of Gibraltar inhibiting Gibraltar 's Chief Secretary from being listed as one of the required competent authorities .
The European Union decided in 061100 to ban the export of arms and nuclear and missile technology as well as luxury products in compliance with the UN resolution number 1718 adopted after Pyongyang carried out nuclear tests in 061000 .
The EU also introduced restrictions of entry to the EU for individuals deemed to be aiding North Korea 's programs for nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .
Before the measures are applied , the legal sanctions document requires a list of authorities , banks and other bodies in each Member State which would supervise compliance with the sanctions and freeze assets .
British spokeswoman Vicky Courtney in Brussels said Britain insisted that Gibraltar 's Chief Secretary be listed as the competent authority as had done on previous occasions without Spain making any complaint .
Gibraltar 's Chief Secretary acts as the link between the gibraltan government and the British government and Governor .
Another diplomatic source , said the Spanish government was afraid that any mention of a gibraltan authority would constitute a precedent in relations between the EU and Gibraltar and so opposed the move this time .
The Government of Spain insists that Britain should be named in the annex to the document but not Gibraltar .
The Spanish Government refuses to afford any international legitimacy to Gibraltar .
The UK and Spain are seeking to reach a formula which would satisfy both sides .
The 2 EU nations have thus far failed to do so .
Courtney said there is some frustration with the fact that the sanctions are being held up .
Courtney added that it is important to find a constructive solution applicable to this and other documents in future and said that the application of other sanctions also runs the risk of being blocked .
Other EU @-@ levied sanctions include those against Iran over the Iranian nuclear program .
Gibraltar was ceded in perpetuity to Britain by Spain under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht , however Madrid still claims sovereignty .

Other countries should emulate Libya 's example but the example has been destroyed because the US and Britain did not fulfill their promises .

Libya may still cooperate with Western countries for mutual benefit .
The lack of foreign support will not cause Libya to return to hostile pursuits .

Illegal arms trafficking increases in Kenya due to easy availability and neighboring conflicts .
Government initiatives to disarm have been ineffective .
Illegal arms trafficking has increased in Kenya and raised concern about security .
Daniel kiptugen of Oxfam stated that there are approximately 140,000 illegal arms in circulation in Kenya among the most vulnerable and marginalized groups .
Illegal weapons are easily procured in urban open @-@ air markets despite a government initiative launched in 2006 to curb the availability of arms .
Kenyan security minister John Michuki recently stated at a ceremony burning 8000 illegal arms seized in 2006 to prevent the spread of firearms --
Firearms fuel the illegal exploitation of natural resources and abet terrorism and other crimes .
The easy affordability and accessibility of arms reduces incentives to pursue non @-@ violent solutions to conflicts and initiates a spiral of insecurity .
Police stated that conflicts along Kenya 's borders have increased the number of weapons in the area .
Conflicts include a 20 @-@ year insurgency in Uganda , anarchy in Somalia since 1991 and the former civil war in Sudan .
Police spokesman Gideon kibunjah stated --
Kenya has always experienced serious arms trafficking but the free sale of arms in Somalia presents an additional problem .
Weapons smuggling has increased since 20061200 when Ethiopian @-@ Somali troops eradicated an Islamist movement from south and central Somalia .
Mogadishu experienced chaos and arms control at the border with Kenya became a low @-@ priority issue .
Kenya has participated since 2000 in a regional treaty to control and reduce the number of illegal arms in the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa but has achieved limited success in disarmament .
Kiptugen stated --
The impact of government disarmament programs had not yet been apparent .
Forced disarmament process has never been successful because it fails to address the impetus of the demand @: competition for natural resources and a lack of government security forces .
Pastoral communities in northern Kenya frequently resolve tribal conflicts concerning water and land access by gun battles .
Communities consider guns a means of self @-@ protection and protection of the community 's livelihood .

Thailand 's Defense Ministry has decided to develop and produce rockets and missiles .
Jane 's Defence Weekly reported on 070412 that the Thai Government has decided to develop and produce rockets and missiles in a radical shift towards building an indigenous defense industry .
Jane 's said the program would lift Thailand beyond the current capacity for producing explosives , ammunition and small arms under licence as well as modernizing and repairing aircraft and armored vehicles .
The Thai armed forces do not currently have any surface @-@ to @-@ surface missiles in their inventory .
Jane 's cited an internal Thai Defense Ministry document which said Thailand will start by developing a multiple @-@ launch rocket ( MLR ) with a range of 80 kilometers ( 48 miles ) .
Jane 's said there is already a project underway to develop a 160 millimeter MLR with a 40 @-@ kilometer range and that other projects include a strategic rocket with turbojet engine guided by Global Position System and inertial navigation system .
The Thai Ministry document says funding pressures on the defense budget and encouragement by unspecified sectors for greater self @-@ sufficiency is driving the new program .
Such a rocket is significant because of the implication of efforts to develop a surface @-@ to @-@ surface missile with a range at the upper limit of the voluntary Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) .
The MTCR is a global disarmament group involving the United States and 33 other members and was established in 870000 to control exports of missiles which can deliver weapons of mass destruction .
Thailand 's King bhumipol Adulyadej enjoys strong support from the armed forces which overthrew the Thai government in a bloodless coup in 060900 and has called for a sufficiency economy .
Jane 's added that the new research and development program was launched before the coup but gained formal approval upon submission to the country 's Defense Council about a month afterwards .

A conference on the world 's nuclear non @-@ proliferation treaty ( NPT ) against the spread of nuclear weapons opens on 30 April 2007 in Vienna .
The meeting will take place through 14 May 2007 and is the 1 st of a series of Preparatory Committee sessions ahead of the next overall review in 2010 .
The NPT went into effect at the height of the Cold War in 1970 and was extended indefinitely in 1995 .
The NPT has 188 signatory States and is a deal in which nuclear weapons States agree to disarm while nations without the bomb agree not to seek the bomb .
The NPT is reviewed every 5 years .
The meeting in May 2005 failed to resolve any key questions due to an agenda disagreement between non @-@ aligned countries and nuclear powers .
The NPT Conference occurs as --
The crisis over Iran 's atomic program escalates though Iran has not yet produced atomic bombs .
A deal to dismantle North Korea 's nuclear program which has produced atomic bombs has stalled .
A U.S. strategy to use pre @-@ emptive force if judged necessary and Britian 's nuclear arsenal upgrade threaten the NPT .
Experts stated the NPT is ill adapted to the modern era in which so-called rogue States seek to acquire a nuclear weapons capacity by 1 st developing peaceful programs under the terms of the treaty .
Experts stated that fixes should include tougher UN inspections and automatic penalties for countries who drop out of the treaty .
The North Korean government withdrew from the NPT in 2003 after expelling United Nations inspectors .
The North Korean government tested an atomic bomb in October 2006 .
The Iranian government justifies nuclear work under article IV of the NPT which guarantees the inalienable right to develop research , production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
U.S. government stated that the Iranian government uses article IV as a cover for the secret development of nuclear weapons which the Treaty bans .

There are believed to be 9 nuclear weapons states .
The States are the 5 allowed under the NPT , Britain , China , France , Russia and the United States .
The States also include North Korea which withdrew from the treaty and 3 nuclear states including India , Pakistan and Israel which have refused to sign the NPT .

According to the statement the prototype RS-24 rocket is unlike the Topol-M in that it is equipped with multiple independently targetable warheads to overwhelm defense systems .
The Ministry of Defense refused to reveal the characteristics of the new missile other than stating it was designed to replace the Soviet @-@ era RS-18 and RS-20 rockets .
Director of the Moscow Center for Defense Information Ivan safranchuk stated --
The RS-24 is a significant modernization of Topol-M .
The principle advantage is that the RS-24 is a Russian rocket .
Other multiple warhead missiles that Russia utilized were built in Ukraine .
Prior to the RS-24 there were no Russian @-@ built multiple warhead missiles .

NATO member States and countries from the former Soviet bloc met in Vienna on 12 June 2007 to re @-@ examine the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe ( CFE ) in light of tensions between Moscow and the West .
The CFE meeting was convened at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and will last until 15 June 2007 .
The Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe was signed in Paris in 1990 and aimed at establishing defense parity in Europe .
The CFE came into force in 1992 and limits deployments of tanks and troops in countries belonging to NATO and the former Warsaw Pact in Eastern Europe .
Chief of the Russian delegation Anatoly Antonov stated in Vienna on 11 June 2007 that Russian officials called the meeting because the Russian Government is unable to freely move Russian troops on Russian territory .
Anotov referred to limitations imposed by the CFE and stated that the choice of which armed forces to deploy belongs to Russian officials .
Russian President Vladimir Putin recently threatened to suspend application of the CFE amid disagreement with the government in Washington over US plans to extend a missile shield into Central Europe .
Russian and U.S. officials have disagreed over the CFE since 1999 with NATO officials stating that Russian officials have failed to honor commitments to withdraw troops from Moldova and Georgia .
Russian officials accuse the United States of a military buildup near Russia 's borders with the US planning new army bases in Romania and Bulgaria as well as the missile shield proposal .
Antonov stated that Russian officials have serious concerns over the plans for military bases .
On 26 April 2007 Putin cited NATO 's lack of movement and called for a freeze on Russian compliance with the CFE which disconcerted Western observers .
Antonov downplayed the idea that Russian officials would pull out of the CFE altogether and stated that the dispute over the US missile shield would not be discussed at the meeting .
Antonov stated that the US plans for military bases in Romania and Bulgaria will be on the meeting 's agenda .
Antonov rejected an offer made by the US and NATO allies to the Russian Government the week of 3 June 2007 to accept a multinational peacekeeping force in the pro @-@ Russian Moldovan separatist region of Transdniestr .

The United Nations said on June 25 , 2007 that sophisticated laboratories inside Afghanistan are converting 90 percent of Afghanistan 's opium into heroin and morphine before smuggling it around the world .
The United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) said Afghanistan is the world 's biggest producer of opium and had exported the illicit drug almost exclusively in its raw form until 2 years ago .
UNODC representative Christina Oguz in Kabul said that she believes the amount of the opium being processed in Afghanistan is approximately 90 percent .
Oguz said that anyone flying over the major opium producing areas would see a lot of small fires in the mountains , which are heroin labs .
Oguz stated that a couple of years ago opium was the primary drug being trafficked out of Afghanistan .
Oguz said there has been an increase of opium being processed into morphine and into heroin and that this indicates sophistication that was not previously present in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan accounts for 92 percent of the world 's heroin supply despite vast internationally @-@ backed efforts to eradicate its opium poppy fields .
Oguz said the annual income from the drugs trade helps finance the Taliban @-@ led insurgency plaguing mainly southern and eastern Afghanistan and that this income totals more than three billion US dollars .
Oguz stated that the drugs have to be fought together with the insurgency .
Afghanistan produced a record 6000 tons of opium in 2006 .
Officials said that the 2007 harvest could exceed the 2006 record because of an increase in opium cultivation in the southern provinces .
Oguz said that favorable weather conditions had also contributed to the increase .
Oguz fears that Afghanistan will have at least the same amount as the 2006 harvest if not more .
Oguz also downplayed international efforts to eradicate poppy crops and said that it was more important to provide poor opium farmers with alternative livelihoods .

Russia 's government announced withdrawal from the Conventional Forces in Europe arms control treaty in hopes that the accompanying uncertainty will pressure European regarding various military , economic , and political issues .
The Russian government announced on 070714 suspension of Russian adherence to the Conventional Forces in Europe ( CFE ) arms control treaty .
The CFE is a key agreement that limits the deployment of forces in central and eastern Europe .
US moves to install anti @-@ missile bases in the region were seen as a key cause of the decision .
Analysts said that it is Europe that is likely to suffer most from the decision 's consequences .
Independent defense analyst Pavel Felgenhauer said the CFE Treaty is much more important to the European countries than the US .
Felgenhauer pointed out that Russia has other problems with Europe and that this withdrawal is another factor reducing confidence and deteriorating relations especially with European countries .
Felgenhauer predicted that actual troop deployments are unlikely to change much and believed the biggest practical effect of Russia 's decision will be an end to mutual inspections and confidence @-@ building measures governed by the Treaty .
Analysts said the hope in the Russian Government is that the uncertainty will weaken European resolve over a number of issues .
Interfax news agency cited Ivan safranchuk of the international center on defense information as saying that the situation will push Europe into a more active position on missile defense .
Europe has largely backed US plans for an anti @-@ missile radar station in the Czech Republic and interceptor rockets in Poland .
The Russian government says the US plans threaten to upset the balance of power on the continent .
Other analysts were doubtful that attempts to pressure the EU would bear fruit .
Editor of the Moscow @-@ based Journal Russia in global affairs Fyodor Lukyanov said the Russian government is hoping that Europe 's extreme unease over this will lead to a softening of Europe 's positions .
Lukyanov thinks the Russian government 's calculations are wrong and that a frightened Europe will join with the United States .
Lukyanov said the decision to freeze the CFE was part of a wider move by the Russian government to use newly found strength to remold the foundations of transatlantic relations and that the Russian government wants to revise the forces influencing interaction in the Euro @-@ Atlantic area that were set when Russia was weaker .
Political analyst and director of Moscow 's Institute for globalization Boris Kagarlitsky said the Russian government also appears to be using its geopolitical strength to put pressure on Europe over business ties .
Kagarlitsky said the withdrawal from the Treaty will be seen in the West as an attempt to put pressure on a number of issues including in the economic sphere .
Disagreements over energy security and a dispute over deliveries of Polish meat have prevented Russian and European Union authorities from agreeing to a new mutual cooperation agreement .
Kagarlitsky said that at some stage the Russian government will put all of the economic issues on the table while expressing doubt whether the Russian government 's goals will be achieved .

Areva signed the reactors agreement with China Guangdong Nuclear Power Corporation ( cgnpc ) in a ceremony in Beijing attended by Sarkozy and Chinese President Hu Jintao .
The agreement was reached after months of expectations that China would buy 2 European pressurized water reactors ( EPRs ) from Areva .
The EPRS will be delivered by the end of 2013 and 2015 , respectively .
Areva also agreed to transfer third generation nuclear technology to cgnpc which would market the equipment in China through a joint venture .
On 27 November 2007 French President Nicolas Sarkozy stated to students at Beijing 's elite Tsinghua University that French and Chinese officials will create a joint venture in the nuclear field .

Sarkozy is not worried about technology transfer .
French officials would share advanced technologies with Chinese officials to form the basis of a win-win situation .

Drug production will be a main focus of ministers , donors and aid agencies meeting in Tokyo on 5 February 2008 through 6 February 2008 to assess progress in Afghanistan .
A paper prepared for the talks said the expansion of the narcotics industry represents the single greatest threat to afghanistanâ € ™ s stability and is increasingly linked to insecurity and terrorist activities .
The source of the document is the website of the joint coordination and monitoring board ( jcmb ) which is a committee working to implement Afghanistan 's 5 @-@ year reconstruction plan .
The paper said the drug trade funds terrorism , fuels corruption and undermines the rule of law that should bring security to the people of Afghanistan .
The paper said traffickers provide weapons , funding and personnel to anti @-@ government rebels while corrupt officials offer protection of drug trade routes , poppy fields and people .
6 , Oguz stated a focus of the Tokyo talks will be the need for immediate action in lieu of talking .
Oguz stated --
The fact that President Hamid Karzai has not appointed a counternarcotics minister to replace the minister who resigned in July 2008 indicates the priority given to drug production even though Karzai has said drug production is 1 of the most important issues for Afghanistan to tackle .
Very little has been done to fight corruption .
Corruption feeds the industry in that farmers often have to pay a 10 percent tax to Afghan officials or Taliban insurgents .
Farmers must pay various bribes .
Farmers receive less than 1 / 4 of the 4 billion dollars that annual trade earns which is equal to more than 1 / 2 of the legal gross domestic product .
No one questions how people have very low salaries but drive in expensive cars and live in expensive houses .
Typically only the couriers are arrested .
Oguz stated bigger criminals are extremely difficult to find .
Some are not living in Afghanistan despite being Afghans .
Afghanistan 's opium is increasingly converted into heroin inside Afghanistan and supplies drug users in Europe , Central Asia and the Middle East .
Oguz stated blaming Afghanistan for the world 's heroin problem would be unfair as heroin production is a shared responsibility .
Chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin come primarily from the developed world and are illegally sent to Afghanistan .
Oguz stated the national strategy to deal with the drugs trade should be tailored to the different circumstances in the 34 provinces .
13 provinces were declared opium @-@ free in 2007 which is double the figure from 2006 .
Oguz stated --
The focus should be on interdiction in southern Afghanistan because of the common interest between insurgents and drug traffickers to keep the south out of reach from the government in Kabul and the international aid community .
The north and center of Afghanistan have more order and government structure and should be offered incentives like development to persuade farmers and other players to cease opium production .
Oguz stated the necessity of a long-term effort to combat the drug problem with Afghanistan rebuilding from below @-@ scratch .
Oguz stated the drug trade links into corruption and the insurgency and will not be an easy task to combat .
Oguz stated combating the drug trade in Thailand took 20 years even though Thailand had some functioning institutions .

Iran warns that new UN resolution against Iran 's nuclear program will complicate the nuclear issue .
IAEA meets in Vienna to discuss Iran issue .
20080303 deputy head of the country 's atomic energy organization Mohammad Saeedi stated --
A new UN Security Council resolution against Iran 's nuclear activities would be irrational and unlawful and complicate the standoff with Western nations rather than promoting resolution of the issue .
The path of the Security Council and any new resolution lacks legal credibility .
Supporters should be held accountable for their illegal act .

Saeedi stated that reports by IAEA chief Mohammed ElBaradei presented a clear picture of Iran 's nuclear program .
The IAEA stated --
The Agency remains unable to confirm the nature of Iran 's nuclear program .
Iran continues to defy UN demands to suspend uranium enrichment .
Intelligence presented to the IAEA board the week of 20080225 suggested that Iran was involved in military research indicating non @-@ conventional weapon development .
Iran dismissed the allegations as baseless and the intelligence used to back them as spurious .
Saeedi stated that the Iranian Government has submitted an assessment of the claimed studies and has no remaining commitments in the matter .

Diplomats stated --
Depending on the outcome of the Security Council vote , the IAEA board is considering tabling a separate resolution demanding that Iran reveal its disputed nuclear activities .

The IAEA board has not made a resolution in 2 years .
US envoy to the IAEA Gregory Schulte stated to reporters prior to the meeting --
Despite limited progress in addressing past issues , troubling questions remain about Iranian activities that strongly suggest a clandestine weapons @-@ related program .
The Board is likely to support the Security Council 's call for Iran to suspend its enrichment @-@ related activities
Indications of weapons work constituting a violation of NPT obligations and Iran 's violation of Security Council resolutions provide strong reason for the Security Council and the IAEA to continue to investigate Iran .
ElBaradei 's latest report stated --
Iran addressed the majority of outstanding questions about its past nuclear program but refused to address allegations about its purported nuclear weapons work .
Iran is pursuing and expanding uranium enrichment in flagrant violation of UN demands .

Possibility of a global agreement to outlaw cluster bombs were given impetus as British prime minister Gordon Brown called for a total ban on the use of the weapons by the British military .
Hopes for a global agreement to outlaw cluster bombs were given a boost on 080522 when British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for a total ban on the use of the weapons by the British military .
The statement from Brown 's spokesman gave new impetus to ongoing negotiations at an international conference on cluster bombs in Dublin .
Brown 's spokesman said Brown had issued instructions to British negotiators in Dublin to work intensively to ban cluster bombs that cause unacceptable harm to civilians .
A British government spokesman said Brown had also asked the Ministry of Defence to assess the remaining munitions in use to ensure that there was no risk to civilians .
The new stance by the British government received a warm welcome from human rights activists and charities .
Head of arms control for Oxfam Anna MacDonald said Britain has at last come in from the cold .
Oxfam hopes that this strong statement from Brown will ensure that the UK signs onto the treaty and immediately gets rid of these weapons which maim and kill long after they have been dropped .
Co @-@ Chair of the cluster munition coalition and Director of Landmine Action Simon Conway expressed gladness that Brown is following up on his previous public commitment to ban cluster bombs .
The Dublin Conference runs until May 30 and is aiming to strike a wide @-@ ranging international agreement that would completely eradicate the use , production , transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions among signatories .
The United States Government on 080521 expressed opposition to a worldwide ban on cluster bombs and called instead for technological fixes that would make them safer .
Cluster bombs were first used in World War II and open in the air and scatter smaller bombs over a wide area .
The fact that many fail to detonate on impact have made them a risk to the lives of civilians for years .
The British military currently possesses 2 Types of cluster ammunition which are the artillery @-@ fired m85 and the m73 launched from helicopters .
Campaigners claim British troops used the m85 bombs in the Iraq war in 030000 .

Tutu said there can be no further delay and that is time to end the slaughter .
Tutu said there are some States which are opposed to such a treaty and will seek to undermine and delay any further progress or will seek to convince others that this Treaty is not required or can not work .
Tutu said these States must not be allowed to succeed because the human cost is too high .
Tutu 's message was delivered by activists of the control arms campaign .
The control arms campaign is pushing for a strong treaty to stop the sales of small arms around the world and was launched 5 years ago by Amnesty International , Oxfam International and the International Action Network on Small Arms .

Denmark 's foreign intelligence admitted that claims made in 2003 that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction were incorrect , yet Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen stated that weapons of mass destruction were not the reason Denmark entered the war in Iraq .
On 4 November 2008 in an address to the Danish parliamentary Defense Commission Danish Foreign Intelligence Service ( FE ) stated --
claims made in 2003 that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction were incorrect .
Fe 's work was careless .
Fe 's information was not based on credible sources .
Fe 's information sources were poor and insufficient .
Fe concluded wrongly that Iraq most likely had weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) .
The intelligence services of all other nations concluded wrongly that Iraq most likely had WMD .
It was difficult for western intelligence agencies to operate under Saddam 's regime .
few Iraqis were able to be recruited as informants under Saddam 's regime .
Iraqis recruited as spies turned out to be weak sources .
Last week Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen defended Danish involvement in the Iraq war .
Rasmussen stated --
Politicians widely believed that Saddam Hussein kept WMD and other chemical and biological weapons .
WMD were not the official reason for Denmark entering the war in Iraq .
Denmark entered the war in Iraq because Saddam refused to cooperate with United Nations .
A majority of lawmakers in the Danish Parliament approved military action .
Defense spokesman for the opposition Social Democrat Party John dyrby paulsen told Danish television that --
Rasmussen claimed Saddam Hussein did not cooperate with the UN only because he knew that the WMD argument would not be believed .

President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica called for a global reduction of military spending as a matter of international security on November 19 , 2008 .
Costa Rica is an unarmed state .
Arias in an address before the UN Security Council said the logic that leads a poor nation to spend excessive sums on its armies and not on its people is perverse and is the antithesis of human security .
It is a serious threat to international security .
Costa Rica presides over the UN Security Council this month .
Arias said Costa Rica is not a naive nation even though it has no military .
Arias is a 1987 novel Peace Prize laureate .
Arias said Costa Rica has not come for the abolition of all armies .
Costa Rica has not come to discuss reduction of world military spending which has reached 3.3 billion dollars a day .
Costa Rica proposed instead that a gradual reduction is not only possible but also imperative particularly for developing nations .
The Costa Rican President decried the limited application of article 26 of the UN Charter .
It calls on the Security Council to use international arms control to avoid diverting human and economic resources .
Arias said article 26 has been a dead letter in the vast cemetery of intentions for world peace until now .
Arias is promoting stronger multi @-@ lateralism .
Arias said nations will continue to arm themselves at the expense of the people 's development and international security as long as the nations do not feel protected by strong regional organizations with real powers to act .
This is particularly true in the poorest countries .
Arias urged the Security Council to apply the Costa Rica consensus .
The consensus forgives debts and provides aid for developing countries that spend more on human resources than the military .
Arias pressed the international body to support the arms trade treaty .
The Treaty would control International arms sales to prevent the illicit use of weapons .
Arias said the 640 million small arms and light weapons that exist in the world has proven to be more lethal than nuclear weapons and is one of the primary threats to national and international security .
74 percent of the small arms and light weapons are owned by civilians .

Cuban biotechnology pharmaceuticals program seeks to expand to overseas markets in developing countries .
The Cuban Government seeks to increase pharmaceutical profits by significantly expanding overseas markets through the development of novel pharmaceuticals and the sale of the world 's most lucrative biotechnology drug , erythropoetin ( EPO ) .
Amgen Inc. invented EPO and shares patent rights with Johnson & Johnson and Kirin Brewery in the most lucrative industrialized markets -- the US , Europe and Japan .
In 2001 EPO generated 6 billion dollars in sales for the 3 corporations .
Amgen sells EPO in the US as epogen for over 36 dollars per dose .
US epogen consumers pay over 10000 dollars each annually for the drug .
EPO is a genetically engineered protein used legally by kidney dialysis and chemotherapy patients and illegally by athletes to increase the concentration of oxygenated red blood cells .
An increasing quantity of biotechnology drugs are produced without any attempts to obtain licenses in developing nations .
US patent holders consider the trade in generic drugs a violation to their intellectual property .
Consumers in developing countries appreciate lower prices on generic drugs .
Cuba considers the generic drug trade good business and currently manufactures EPO for sale in Argentina , Brazil , India and other countries that do not acknowledge most US and European drug patents .
Cuban biotechnology executive Blanca tormo stated that Cuba carefully abides by intellectual property laws and exclusively sells EPO in countries in which no entity has exclusive patent rights .
The largest potential pharmaceutical market is in the 1.3 billion person Chinese market .
Amgen , Kirin , the small Canadian biotechnology company Dragon Pharmaceuticals Inc. and at lease 4 Chinese companies currently sell EPO in China .
The generic product costs as low as 5 dollars per dose in China .
By joining the World Trade Organization in 2001 China agreed to abide by WTO intellectual property agreements but the agreements contain mechanisms allowing developing nations to circumvent patents , particularly in pharmaceuticals , when public health concerns are deemed to override the patents .
Current state of biotechnology in Cuba --
The Cuban biotechnology industry currently generates 100 million dollars annually and reaches markets in over 40 countries .
Cuba 's genetic engineering and biotechnology center occupies modern towers approved by Fidel Castro and employs over 1000 people to engineer proteins to combat major terminal illnesses .
Cuba currently produces novel biotechnology products @: hepatitis B and meningitis B vaccines , a skin growth factor , interferons , thrombosis and heart attack medicines and AIDS treatments .
Cuba has produced over 78 million doses of hepatitis B vaccine .
Cuba licensed its meningitis B vaccine to the British company GlaxoSmithKline , which hopes to eventually sell the vaccine in the United States under a Clinton @-@ era exemption to the Cuban trade embargo .
Cuba is cooperating with the small Canadian company YM biosciences on trials of a head and neck cancer treatment .
Cuba is seeking further partnerships with foreign companies in vaccine research for AIDS , 8 types of cancer and cholera .
Cuban officials including attendees of the annual bio 2002 Industry Conference 20020600 in Toronto stated that negotiations for new biotechnology trade and production agreements were in progress with Brazil , Malaysia , Netherlands , Spain , Mexico , Venezuela , Vietnam , Ukraine , Germany and the United States .
Cuba has or is negotiating technology transfer agreements with 14 countries , chiefly developing nations including India , Algeria and South Africa .
20020500 US Undersecretary of State for Arms Control John Bolton stated that the US believes Cuba has at least a limited offensive biological warfare research and development effort and has provided dual @-@ use biotechnology to other rogue states .

Russian military space forces put on test duty an optical space @-@ object tracking facility located in the ex @-@ Soviet republic of Tajikistan
The Russian military space forces on 020718 inaugurated an optical tracking facility that is intended to monitor objects in space and put it on test duty .
The okno optical tracking facility is near the town of Nurek in the central region of the ex @-@ Soviet republic of Tajikistan and located 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) southeast of the Tajik capital Dushanbe .
Russian Space Forces said in a statement carried by the Interfax @-@ military news agency that the okno ( window ) complex is capable of tracking objects 40000 kilometers ( 24800 miles ) from Earth .
The okno offers a better range and precision than standard radar facilities according to the Space Forces .
The report did not elaborate on how the okno works .
The report saids Space Forces chief Col. @-@ Gen. Anatoly Perminov traveled to the site to report on the facility 's launch to Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov , .
According to images on the Federation of American Scientists @' web site , the facility involves telescope @-@ like equipment housed in several large spheres .
The okno is located in Tajikistan 's mountains 2200 meters ( 7260 feet ) above sea level and takes advantage of the area 's fine weather and high transparency of the atmosphere .
Such conditions are not found elsewhere in the former Soviet Union .
The site describes it as similar to the U.S. GEODSS system , or ground @-@ based electro @-@ optical Deep Space Surveillance .
Three such U.S. facilities are operational .
The construction of the facility started in 790000 , but stopped after the 910000 Soviet collapse when Tajikistan slid into a 5 year civil war that undermined its economy and left its population in deep poverty .
About 25000 Russian troops and border guards are deployed in Tajikistan to help protect its volatile southern border with Afghanistan and prevent drug smuggling .

Italy is leading a technology transfer initiative developed by the G-8 countries which will improve the technology of developing countries .
The goal of the initiative is to provide the infrastructure and good governance needed to alleviate poverty .
Italy sponsors technology transfer to developing countries as a form of foreign aid and alleviating poverty .
Premier Silvio Berlusconi supported and sponsored the initiative with counterparts at recent international gatherings including the last G-8 Summit in Canada .
Italy persuaded partners to let Italy lead the G-8 summit 's e-government initiative called DOT Force or digital opportunity task force .
Former IBM executive and current technology minister of Italy Lucio Stanca is leading Italy 's Internet program for developing countries as part of the Group of Eight 's efforts to reduce the digital divides .
Silvio Berlusconi gave Lucio Stanca his current role of modernizing Italy 's bureaucracy .
Lucio Stanca stated that Italy will not targeting countries that have very basic needs .
The first technology transfer projects will be implemented in the fall .
One such project is creating an electronic database for real estate in Mozambique .
So far 12 million euros or 12 million dollars have been allocated to finance the initial phase of these projects .
This cost is only a fraction of the total cost .
Italy is financing most of the cost but the World Bank and possibly some private telecommunications companies are also contributing .
Lucio Stanca stated that the world must solve the problem of world hunger , disease and education but in order to do that the world must first help create good governance .
The rationale behind creating good governance is that by making the public administration of developing countries more transparent and accountable developing countries would become more attractive potential recipients of traditional forms of aid such as loans and investments .
In effect good governance would invalidate the reason used by countries that do not do enough that donating is not appropriate because it is impossible to know whether the aid would reach its true destination .
The United Nations telecommunications agency stated that 83 countries in Africa , Asia , and the former Soviet Union still have less than 10 telephone lines for every 100 people .
Other studies note that even though the Internet has been in use for more than a decade , only about 10 percent of the world 's population has access to it .
Reducing the digital divide has taken on a central role in the fight against global poverty in recent years .
The United Nations has repeatedly stated that the world 's poor may be further marginalized if there is no improvement in access to information technology .
Reducing the digital divide was declared a priority at last year 's G-8 Summit in Genoa which included Russia .
Italy launched pilot programs in 5 countries at a conference in Sicily sponsored by the United Nations and Italy in April , 2002 .
The Conference focused on how technologies can be used to improve administration in developing countries .

Philippine intelligence reports reveal Singapore @-@ based al-Qaida group 's plans to bomb embassies , U.S. corporations , and warships in Singapore and to crash hijacked planes at Singapore 's National Airport .

Philippine intelligence reports obtained by the Associated Press reveal a Singapore @-@ based al-Qaida group 's plans to attack embassies of the United States , Great Britain , Israel and Australia , to attack U.S. corporations and warships in Singapore and to crash a hijacked plane at the country 's international airport .
The group ordered a chemist to buy 4 tons of ammonium nitrate .
The amount is 4 times the amount of explosive that Timothy McVeigh used to bomb the Oklahoma City Federal Building .
The embassy attacks were successfully stopped in the final stages by U.S. investigators and allies in Southeast Asia but the explosives were not recovered .
1 of the phillipine reports states that Singapore is a target for terrorist attacks because of its 17000 U.S. residents and 6000 multinational companies including several American companies .
The terrorists belonged to Jemaah Islamiah designated by the U.S. government as a terrorist organization and described in 1 of the phillipine reports as part of the broader al-Qaida syndicate .
The group planned attacks in Singapore before and after the hijackings in the United States on 11 September 2001 .
The group is believed responsible for attacks throughout Southeast Asia .
The group is suspected in the bombings in Bali that killed approximately 200 people in October 2002 .
The attacks in Singapore were prevented after 15 individuals were arrested in December 2001 .
2 of the individuals arrested were released .
1 of the Philippine reports stated that local officials and Western business executives were shocked by the ability of Al-Qaida to plant operatives in such a tightly controlled society as Singapore .
The members of the 4 or 5 @-@ man terror cells led normal lives and avoided contact with known Islamic organizations .
The members were not known to be active members of mosques in Singapore .
In efforts to avoid detection the members used code names and code numbers , communicated by e-mail , encrypted their computer diskettes and used prepaid mobile phone cards .
Investigators stated that after the U.S. military campaign began in Afghanistan members of Jemaah Islamiah planned to procure 21 tons of explosive materials and bought 4 tons of ammonium nitrate in an operation to attack embassies in Singapore .
The ammonium nitrate was purchased by captured Malaysian chemist and retired army captain Yazid Sufaat .
Authorities state that Sufaat hosted 11 September hijackers and the accused terrorism suspect Zacarias Moussaoui in Malaysia at different times in 2000 .
Authorities state that Sufaat provided Moussaoui with counterfeit documents with which to enter the United States .
Moussaoui was arrested in August 2001 in Minnesota and remains the only U.S. defendant indicted as a conspirator with the perpetrators of the 11 September attacks .
The Singaporean cell members were believed to be conducting reconnaissance when they were apprehended .
The explosive materials were sent to an Indonesian island off Singapore .
During the attack planning an Indonesian and a Kuwaiti arrived in Singapore with instructions for the embassy operations .
Cell members guided them to the U.S. embassy which was videotaped including close @-@ up shots .
The adjoining Australian embassy was also videotaped .
In a separate plot a member of the cell took digital photographs of U.S. military aircraft and personnel using Singapore 's Paya Lebar air base .
Singapore authorities believe a cell leader traveled to Afghanistan and briefed al-Qaida leaders about the proposed shuttle bus attack between August 1999 and April 2000 .
The al-Qaida officials apparently turned down the plan because the target was not large enough .
A few days after the Singapore arrests in December 2001 a videotape was found in an abandoned house in Kabul , Afghanistan in which a narrator describes locations in Singapore where bombs could be hidden to attack Americans .
Investigators searched the homes of those detained in Singapore and found an identical videotape .
The Singapore wing of Jemaah Islamiah may also have Thai connections since at least 5 members who eluded the 2001 arrests fled to Thailand .
1 of the reports stated --
The group had previously plotted to conduct 7 simultaneous explosions in different areas of Singapore .
The Group had further planned to hijack a U.S. , British or Singaporean plane and crash it into Changi Airport in order to threaten the U.S. government to halt its military strikes against Afghanistan .
In February 2003 Indonesian police announced the arrest of the alleged head of the cell in Singapore Mas Selamat Kastari who was suspected of planning the airport attack .
Kastari also was suspected in the proposed shuttle bus attack .
The reports arose after intelligence agents from Southeast Asian countries realized after the 11 September 2001 attacks that many radical Islamic groups in the region had close connections to each other and to Osama bin Laden 's terrorist network .

International Atomic Energy Agency director ElBaradei says the biggest danger facing the world is not new nuclear States but the risk of extremist groups obtaining atomic weapons .
Director General of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency Mohammed ElBaradei told a conference of the world 's top defense officials on 080209 that the biggest danger facing the world is not new nuclear States but the risk of extremist groups obtaining atomic weapons .
ElBaradei urged a reduction of the world 's nuclear stockpile and better controls and said that an extremist group would use nuclear weapons upon procuring such weapons .
ElBaradei said that even countries which have nuclear weapons know that a country which uses nuclear weapons will be pulverized but that extremist groups will use nuclear weapons if possible .
ElBaradei said that countries need to be aware that extremist groups procuring nuclear weapons is the number one security threat the world is facing and added as a note of caution that given the state of the system of international controls it was hard to determine whether nuclear materials were ending up with extremist groups .
ElBaradei said much of the material that is reported stolen is never recovered and that a lot of the material recovered has never been reported stolen .
ElBaradei said in reference to Iran that the international community should quickly engage in talks with the Iranian government to secure guarantees that the Iranian nuclear program will not be used to develop weapons and that such confidence can only be built through direct negotiations .
U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman said that Iran remained the world 's top arms control challenge and that it would be a profound mistake to focus on the recent U.S. national intelligence estimate that suggested Iran no longer had a nuclear weapons program .
Lieberman pointed out that in the Nie report which said that the Iranian government 's covert work on bomb design may have been temporarily suspended in 03000 it was also and far more importantly stated that Iran 's overt work on enrichment continues apace .
German foreign minister Frank @-@ Walter Steinmeier similarly emphasized that the Nie report in no way grants Iran any kind of absolution .
Germany has been working with the 5 permanent U.N. Security Council members on the Iranian nuclear issue .

On 080218 the United Kingdom 's Foreign Office released an early version of a 020000 dossier of prewar intelligence on Iraq that became vital to Tony Blair 's case for going to war in Iraq .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband published a draft of the dossier on Iraq 's weapons capabilities following a request under freedom of information laws .
The dossier of prewar intelligence on Iraq includes references to intelligence claims that Iraq had acquired uranium and had equipment necessary to produce chemical weapons .
The dossier of prewar intelligence on Iraq does not contain a claim that Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes .
The claim that Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes was an allegation that became crucial to Blair 's support of the 030000 United States led invasion of Iraq and the allegation was later discredited .
Freedom of Information campaigners allege the assertion that that Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes was inserted into later drafts of the dossier of prewar intelligence shortly before the dossier was published on the orders of Tony Blair 's office in order to strengthen the case for war in Iraq .
The Freedom of Information campaigners allegations is strongly denied by Government of the United Kingdom .
David Miliband stated that the early draft of dossier of prewar intelligence on Iraq was not used as the basis for later documents that were drafted by the Joint Intelligence Committee .
The early draft of dossier of prewar intelligence on Iraq was produced by then Foreign Office press office chief John Williams .
Tony Blair presented a final draft of the joint intelligence committee dossier to the United Kingdom 's Parliament on 020924 .
The final draft of the joint intelligence committee dossier included the claim that Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes .
The name of the joint intelligence committee dossier was Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
A second document was published in 030200 was found to have repeated verbatim parts of an academic study on Iraq 's supposed concealment of weapons of mass destruction .
The second document that was published in 030200 became known as the dodgy dossier .
Hans Blix stated in 070000 that Hans Blix believed that Tony Blair had replaced question marks with exclamation marks in intelligence dossiers to justify the decision to invade Iraq .

Robin Cook was one of the ministers John Williams advised for a time .
David Miliband criticized the decision of freedom of information authorities to order the release of the John Williams document .
David Miliband stated in writing that officials and other people who draft policy documents should not feel constrained in presenting free and frank advice through fear that their ideas will be made public .
Robin Cook resigned from Tony Blair 's cabinet in opposition to the Iraq war because Robin Cook claimed he could not support military action without international approval .

Colombian Vice President Francisco Santos had told the 65 @-@ member Conference on Disarmament on 080304 that the Colombian Government was alarmed because uranium is the primary basis for generating dirty weapons of mass destruction and for terrorism .
Santos backed off slightly and told the Associated Press on 080305 that Colombian authorities have no evidence or indication that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia are seeking to use the uranium to build a radioactive dirty bomb .
Santos said in a telephone interview from Brussels that what Santos had meant was to take note and not take it lightly and said that putting the FARC rebels and the word uranium in the same sentence was alarming .
The FBI has an office in Bogota and Spokesman Richard kolko said in Washington that the FBI has no information or intelligence regarding the FARC attempting to use weapons of mass destruction .
The FARC has been fighting successive Colombian Governments for more than 4 decades using conventional weapons .
The document addressing uranium was found in a laptop belonging to a top FARC commander named Raul Reyes .
Reyes was killed on 080301 in a raid into Ecuador that has generated intense international criticism .
The poorly written communication addressed to Reyes was dated 080216 and was signed by Edgar Tovar .
Santos said Tovar commands a FARC front near Ecuador .
Tovar wrote that a man named Belisario in Bogota supplies Tovar with explosives and sent Tovar a catalog and specifications .
Tovar wrote that Belisario proposed to sell each kilo at US $ 2.5 million and deliver it and that Tovar and Reyes would then find a buyer .
Tovar wrote the deal would be with a Government and to sell them a sizable amount .
Tovar wrote Belisario had 50 kilos ready and could sell a lot more as Belisario had direct contact with uranium suppliers .
The uranium reference in Tovar 's writing was quickly cited by Colombia 's government while seeking to deflect criticism over the raid .
Gen. Oscar Naranjo said at an explosive news conference that the FARC mentioning negotiations for 50 kilos of uranium means that the FARC are taking big steps in the world of terrorism to become a global aggressor and were not just domestic guerrillas but transnational terrorists .
Santos took Colombia 's complaints to the European Union 's foreign affairs representative Javier Solano on 080305 .
Santos told the AP after meeting with Solano that the Europeans were really worried about the uranium and were not taking the issue lightly .
Colombian officials say they have no other information from the laptop or other sources indicating FARC interest in radioactive materials or unconventional weapons .
It was n't clear what exactly the material Tovar was writing about might be .
Santos said the uranium mentioned in the communication sounded like processed uranium .
The price mentioned suggests that the uranium would be processed and hence dangerous .
Charles Ferguson is a physicist with the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington and said that unprocessed uranium is relatively harmless and goes for about US $ 100 a kilo .
Ferguson expressed fear if the uranium in question were the highly enriched weapons @-@ grade uranium capable of being used in a low @-@ yield improvised nuclear device .

Abdel @-@ Maksoud stated that a recent amendment to the Egyptian judicial system allows defendants to appeal within 60 days .
The 25 people sentenced have been in custody since December 2006 .
The arrests were believed to have been sparked by a militia @-@ style demonstration by student Brotherhood members from the Al @-@ Azhar University in Cairo .
The demonstrators wore black and masks similar to those of the militant Palestinian Hamas and Lebanon 's Hezbollah groups .
The demonstration prompted a government investigation into whether the Brotherhood had resurrected a military wing .
The Brotherhood figures were referred to a military court after the arrests .
The referral is authorized under emergency laws in effect since 1981 that allow the president to refer civilians to military tribunals .
Brotherhood members have since been routinely tried before military courts but the trial in 2007 @-@ 2008 is the largest in years .
The verdict in the yearlong trial occurred amid a government crackdown on the Brotherhood and unrest in Egypt over rising food prices and stagnant wages .
More than 800 Brotherhood members have been detained in 2008 in an effort to decrease influence as President Hosni Mubarak enters the 27 th year in power .
100 s of Brotherhood members and supporters have been detained in Security sweeps since October 2006 .
The 40 senior figures on trial were detained as part of the sweeps .
7 senior figures were tried in absentia and are believed to be outside the country .
Some of the 7 's whereabouts are unknown .
5 of the absent senior figures received 10 @-@ year prison terms including Swiss @-@ based Egyptian @-@ born businessman Youssef M. Nada whose company has been listed by the United States since 2001 as an organization accused of helping fund terrorism .
London @-@ based human rights group Amnesty International called the sentences on 15 April 2008 a perversion of justice and demanded the men be released and retried in a civilian court .
Amnesty International said in a statement that the sentences leave little doubt that the Egyptian authorities are determined to undermine what has become the main opposition group in Egypt .
Amnesty International stated trying civilians before military courts flouts international standards of fair trial and is inherently unjust .
The Muslim Brotherhood 's supreme leader Mohammed Mahdi Akef denounced the verdict and stated that Egyptian authorities are corrupt gangsters .
Akef stated to the Associated Press that there was no evidence against the convicted and that acquittals for the convicted are expected .
Akef stated in a telephone interview that gangs not politicians rule Egypt .
Akef would not discuss the Brotherhood 's future plans .
The Brotherhood won 88 of parliament 's 454 seats in the 2005 elections with Brotherhood candidates running as independents .

South African government officials will not intervene to disallow Chinese arms shipment to Zimbabwe despite volatile political situation following contested presidential election .
South African officials approved transit of the arms shipment to Zimbabwe stating it can not act unilaterally to prevent a trade deal between 2 countries .
On 17 April 2008 a South African government spokesman stated that South Africa will not intervene to stop a shipment of Chinese @-@ made weapons from reaching Zimbabwe despite the acute instability of the political situation in Zimbabwe .
South African government spokesman Themba Maseko stated that the Zimbabwean government 's failure to release election results 2 weeks after elections is cause for great concern and that the dire situation requires mediation .
Maseko 's comments were the strongest issued on the subject by the South African Government to date .
South African President Thabo Mbeki is the main mediator in Zimbabwe .
Mbeki has stated that there is no crisis in Zimbabwe despite the increasing violence and intimidation since the 29 March 2008 vote and the refusal of Zimbabwe 's election commission to release results that independent observers and the opposition State show President Robert Mugabe lost the vote .
Critics call the South African reaction appeasement .
Criticism increased on 17 April 2008 following a report that South African mediator Sydney Mufamadi led an arms control committee meeting that approved transit of a shipment of Chinese weapons across South African territory en route to Zimbabwe .
The Chinese ship called an Yue Jiang docked in Durban harbor in South Africa after receiving approval from Port authorities late on 16 April 2008 .
The Beeld newspaper stated the ship was carrying approximately 3 million rounds of ammunition for small arms and AK-47s , approximately 3500 mortars and mortar launchers and 1500 rockets for rocket @-@ propelled grenades .
The newspaper stated it obtained a copy of the ship 's cargo documentation finalized 3 days after Zimbabwe 's election on 01 April 2008 .
A South African government official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed the presence of weapons on the ship but gave no further details .
Durban port authorities and police explosives inspectors could not immediately be reached for comment .
Government spokesman Maseko stated that if administrative papers are in order the Government of South Africa can not intervene to prevent weapons from being transported through its territory to a neighboring landlocked country .
After a cabinet meeting Maseko stated to reporters --
The Government of South Africa can not act unilaterally to prevent a trade deal between 2 countries .
South Africa is not involved in the arrangement .
It would be possible but very difficult for South Africa to intervene and to disallow the shipment .
There was presently no trade embargo against Zimbabwe .
China is one of Zimbabwe 's main trade partners and allies .
A group representing mainly white South Africans called afriforum stated it would organize protests along the route to Zimbabwe .
Afriforum 's kallie kriel stated that the National Conventional Arms Control Committee had granted approval for the transit of the weapons on 14 April 2008 .
Kriel stated he had written to Committee Chairman and Local Government Minister Sydney Mufamadi asking him to retract the permission .
Kriel stated that the South African Government 's approval for the transport of the arms across South African territory effectively means that the government is replacing its ineffective policy of silent diplomacy with a more catastrophic policy of complicity with the State violence and human rights violations committed by the Zimbabwean government against its own citizens .
The South African opposition Democratic Alliance agreed with kriel 's comments .
Mufamadi also heads the South African mediating team between Zimbabwe 's ruling ZANU-PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change .
Mufamadi 's office referred reporters to the Arms Control Committee whose spokesman did not immediately return phone calls .

The South African Government stated on April 4 , 2008 that the South African Government will probably not stop the arms shipment head to Zimbabwe .
This decision is controversial because Zimbabwe is currently politically unstable .
A South African government spokesman stated on April 4 , 2008 that South Africa will not intervene to stop a shipment of Chinese @-@ made weapons from reaching Zimbabwe even though the political situation in Zimbabwe is dire .
The shipment is in a ship called the an Yue hiang which was anchored outside Durban harbor after receiving permission late on April 16 , 2008 to dock .
The shipment contains nearly 3 million rounds of ammunition for small arms and AK-47s , about 3500 mortars and mortar launchers and 1500 rockets for rocket @-@ propelled grenades .
This report comes from the Beeld newspaper which claimed to have a copy of the ship 's cargo documentation finalized on April 1 , 2008 which was 3 days after Zimbabwe 's election .
An anonymous government official confirmed that the shipment contained weapons but gave no further details .
Durban port authorities and police explosives inspectors could not be reached for comment .
The South African Revenue Service said customs officials were bound by confidentiality rules and could not give details of the content of the cargo .
Spokesman Themba Maseko stated as long as administrative papers are in order South Africa can not intervene to prevent weapons being transported through South African territory to Zimbabwe .
Defense Secretary January Masilela confirmed to South African radio that the National Conventional Arms Control Committee granted approval for the transit of the weapons .
January Masilela stated that if the buyer is the Zimbabwean sovereign government and the seller is the Chinese sovereign government , South Africa has nothing to do with the transaction because South Africa works according to established international conventions which allow the nation no jurisdiction over goods in transit .
Sydney Mufamadi is the government official who approved the transit and he is the same official who heads the team mediating in the Zimbabwe crisis .
Themba Maseko stated that the situation in Zimbabwe is dire because elections are held and results are not released 2 weeks after .
This was the strongest comment on Zimbabwe so far by the South African Government .
On April 17 , 2008 Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai called on South Africa and President Thabo Mbeki to step aside as mediator for Zimbabwe in favor of Zambia 's president , who has taken a tougher stance toward Mugabe .
Afriforum criticized the decision to approve the arms shipment .
Afriforum is a lobbying group representing mainly white South Africans .
Afriforum stated that the group would organize protests along the route to Zimbabwe .
Kallie kriel of afriforum stated that the South African Government 's approval for the transport of the arms across South African territory will in effect mean that the Government is replacing an ineffective policy of silent diplomacy with an even more catastrophic policy of complicity to the State violence and human rights violations committed by the Zimbabwean government against Zimbabwean citizens .
The South African Revenue Service stated that the ship would be subject to standard inspection procedures and the cargo would not be released until ithe cargo was proved to be compliant to customs formalities .
The approval process can be lengthy .
Zimbabwe is a landlocked country neighboring Zimbabwe ,

The Security Council resolution notes that some unnamed countries have not filed a report on the member nations efforts to adopt these laws .
The report was due to the United Nations in 041000 .
The 080425 Security Council resolution stresses the need to enhance the coordination of national , regional and international efforts to strengthen a global response to the serious challenge of keeping weapons from terrorists and the threat to international security .
The 040400 Security Council resolution was adopted to close a loophole in global efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
International treaties targeted weapons proliferation by Governments until Resolution 1540 was adopted in 040000 there was no legal instrument to prevent terrorists , criminal scientists , black marketeers and other non @-@ State actors from obtaining weapons of mass destruction .
Resolution 1540 was introduced as the International Atomic Energy Agency was investigating a vast black market in nuclear equipment and technology .
The black market investigation was encouraged by Pakistan 's admission in 040200 that Pakistan 's leading nuclear scientist had passed technology to Iran , Libya and North Korea .
Pakistan 's leading nuclear scientist , was Abdul Qadeer Khan .
Resolution 1540 requires all countries to adopt laws to prevent non @-@ State actors from manufacturing , acquiring or trafficking in nuclear , biological or chemical weapons , the materials to make them , and the missiles and other systems to deliver them .
Resolution 1540 requires all countries to take measures to account for and secure these weapons , missiles and other weapons material .
Resolution 1540 also demands that countries develop border controls and step up law enforcement efforts to detect , deter , prevent and combat the illicit trafficking and brokering of weapons of mass destruction .
All countries were required to submit a report within 6 months to a Security Council committee monitoring implementation of esolution 1540 .
The resolution adopted on 080425 extends the Resolution 1540 Committee 's mandate until 110425 and again calls upon all States that have not yet presented a first report on steps the States have taken or intend to take to implement Resolution 1540 to submit such a report to the 1540 Committee without delay .
The 080425 resolution emphasizes the importance for all States to fully implement Resolution 1540 .
The 080425 resolution also calls on the Resolution 1540 Committee to continue to intensify its efforts to promote the full implementation by all States by reaching out to countries , facilitating technical assistance , and promoting shared experience and lessons learned .
The Security Council stated that not all States have presented to the Resolution 1540 Committee the state 's national reports on implementation of Resolution 1540 and that the full implementation of Resolution 1540 by all States is a long-term task that will require continuous efforts at national , regional and international levels .
The Security Council stated that full implementation of Resolution 1540 by all States includes the adoption of national laws and measures to ensure implementation of the Resolution 1540 inspired national laws .
Dumisani Kumalo stated that many developing countries find the reporting requirements for Resolution 1540 and other resolutions onerous when they are trying to provide food , health care and jobs for the people of developing countries .

A leading arms expert stated on 8 May 2008 that Chinese government is making dramatic improvements to China 's nuclear arsenal which raises questions for future arms control efforts .
Director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Bates Gill spoke at a panel for journalists while on a visit to Beijing to promote an annual report on the global arms industry .
Gill stated --
Recent upgrades have increased the accuracy and mobility of China 's arsenal while a switch from liquid to solid fuel has shortened reaction times .
China stands out due to the effort to modernize , expand and improve nuclear weapons capability .
Among the 5 nuclear Powers China is making the most dramatic improvements in nuclear force which raises arms control questions .
The Chinese Government stated China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict and China 's arsenal , estimated at just over 100 nuclear @-@ armed missiles , is the smallest of the 5 main nuclear weapon Powers .
Chinese officials signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1992 and gill stated the recent steps are aimed mainly at reducing the vulnerability of China 's deterrent force .
Gill stated that improvements in China 's conventional military are even more dramatic after more than 10 years of double @-@ digit percentage increases in annual defense spending .
Gill stated the large increase in the military capability of China is targeted mostly at Taiwan but has the possibility going forward with force projection elsewhere .
Taiwan is a self @-@ governing island that China claims is part of China 's territory and has threatened to invade .
Gill stated that the increase in military capability complicates the issue of China as a player in the arms control agenda and that the Chinese government would need to be engaged in future efforts to cap or reduce numbers of nuclear weapons .
Gill praised Beijing officials for decreasing sales of weapons and military technology abroad which Gill believes was largely done out of a desire to be viewed as a more responsible player in international society .
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute China has only a 2 percent share of the global arms export trade .
Gill stated that the shift in the way the Chinese government views the problem of nonproliferation is very positive .
Gill stated that authorities need to strengthen regulation to prevent weapons from entering conflict zones , particularly in Africa where Chinese arms are used by both government and rebel forces in Sudan 's Darfur region .
Retired People 's Liberation Army Colonel Teng jianqun spoke alongside Gill on the panel and stated that China has substantial restrictions on weapons sales abroad .
Teng conceded that some dealers violated the rules and were beyond the Government 's direct control .
Teng stated that further steps were being taken to boost awareness of the rules , partly through courses for government and defense industry leaders run by the foreign ministry @-@ sponsored China Arms Control and Disarmament Association of which Teng is Deputy Secretary @-@ General .

The legislation is the most recent effort by Japan to ascribe more freedom to its tightly controlled military and would overturn a ban on the military use of space .
On 13 May 2008 Japan 's powerful lower house of parliament voted to allow Japan 's space programs to be utilized for national defense .
The legislation is the most recent effort by Japan to ascribe more freedom to the tightly controlled military technically known as a self @-@ defense force .
The legislation is expected to be approved by the upper house .
The legislation is primarily aimed at permitting military use of Japan 's civilian @-@ controlled spy satellite network for defense as defined by the pacifist constitution .
The bill states that space development has become increasingly important .
The bill states that space programs must contribute to ensure peace and safety of international society as well as the national security of Japan .
The bill does not specify how the programs will be utilized but the satellite network and other assets could potentially be used for surveillance , planning and for a missile defense shield Japan is constructing with the United States .
The bill would overturn a ban on the military use of space imposed on Japan 's nascent space program in 1969 .
The U.S. @-@ drafted 1947 Constitution prohibits Japan from offensive warfare .
The legislation stipulates that all members of the cabinet and not just education , science and technology ministers will be responsible for Japan 's future space projects .

7 NATO allies to sign agreement to create a cyber Defense Research Center in Estonia .
Experts from NATO member states will be recruited to conduct research and training on cyber warfare and will be prepared to assist allies with response to the growing threat of cyber attack .
7 NATO allies are prepared to sign a deal on 14 May 2008 to create a research center in Tallinn , Estonia to improve the NATO alliance 's defenses against cyber attacks .
Cyber attacks are considered a growing threat to military and civilian computer networks .
In 2007 Estonia experienced an unprecedented number of cyber attacks that disabled government and corporate computer networks .
The attacks occurred after a dispute between the Governments of Russia and Estonia over the relocation of a Soviet war memorial .
Many Estonians suspect the Russian government was responsible for the cyber attacks but the Government of Russia denies involvement .
Defense chiefs from Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Germany , Italy , Spain and Slovakia will sign the agreement to provide staff and funding for the center .
The United States will join the project as an observer and other NATO nations may join later .
Signing of the Agreement is a peripheral issue of the meeting of Chiefs of Defense Staff from the 26 ally countries of NATO .
The meeting is expected to focus on NATO missions in Afghanistan and Kosovo .
The generals will also discuss cooperation with Balkan and former Soviet nations including Russia and Ukraine .
The Cyber Defense Center will be operational in August 2008 with the formal opening planned for 2009 .
A staff of 30 specialists will conduct research and training on cyber warfare and will be prepared to assist NATO members with response to any future cyber attacks .
Head of the center major Raul rikk stated to the Associated Press in Tallinn --
The attacks against Estonia last year were cyber terrorism .
The mission of the center is to create new capabilities to fight new threats .
Experts will be recruited from various NATO member States and from various sectors including information technology , science , military and finance .
Estonia is 1 of Europe 's most Internet @-@ savvy nations .
Estonia proposed creation of the center in 2003 but it was not until after the cyber attacks of 2007 that NATO leaders were convinced it was needed .

Dmitry Medvedev was impressed by the weapons and the level of training .
Dmitry Medvedev also stated that it is good that the military is getting new missiles like the Topol-M .
Missiles from the base in teikovo took part in the Victory Day parade on May 9 , 2008 when Russia displayed the country 's military hardware on Red Square in Moscow for the first time since the Soviet collapse .

Vladimir Putin has threatened to point nuclear missiles at countries that take part in U.S. missile defense and opted out of a key Soviet @-@ era arms control treaty .
Topol-M missiles are capable of hitting targets more than 10000 kilometers or 6000 miles away .
The missiles are deployed in both silo @-@ based and truck @-@ mounted versions .
Strategic missiles forces chief General Nikolai Solovtsov stated that the Topol-M is a new step in missile design .
Vladimir Putin and other officials have boasted about the Topol-M 's ability to penetrate any prospective missile defense .
Yuri solomonov designed the missile and stated that the missile drops engines at a significantly lower altitude than earlier designs which makes it hard for an enemy 's early warning system to detect the launch .
Yuri solomonov stated that the missiles @' warhead and decoys closely resemble one another in flight , making it very difficult for a foe to select the real target from a multitude of false ones .
Deployment of topol=ms has proceeded slowly .

20080710 the image with 4 launches was absent from Sepah 's main page but both images were in the archive .
Fitzpatrick stated that the photo was probably manipulated to obscure the failure of the 4 th missile in order to maintain the impact of Iran 's demonstration of power .

The image was described as depicting part of military maneuvers in which nine missiles were test fired , including an enhanced version of the Shahab @-@ 3 .

A key European arms control treaty must be maintained .
The Treaty is a major instrument of transparency .
The arms control treaty limits the number of conventional weapons that can be deployed west of the Ural Mountains .

Russian prosecutors have sent the case against ANAR Godzhayev to court after charging Godzhayev with attempting to smuggle tantalum powder to Iran .
Godzhayev could be sentenced to 7 years in prison if convicted .
The Russian Prosecutor General 's Office stated on 17 July 2008 that the founder of a Russian company involved in trade with Iran has been charged with trying to smuggle a metal that can be used for weapons of mass destruction or delivery systems to the Islamic Republic .
The Prosecutor General 's Office said in a statement --
Prosecutors in southern Russia 's Astrakhan region across the Caspian Sea from Iran have sent the case against ANAR Godzhayev to court .
The metal in question is tantalum .
Tantalum can be used in the production of chemical processing equipment , nuclear reactors and missile parts and is subject to export restrictions under Russian law .
Tantalum powder is a super @-@ grade chemical and can be used in the manufacture of mobile phones , personal computers , motor vehicles and electronics goods .
Prosecutors have stated that Godzhayev lied about the contents of an outgoing shipment in customs documents after a business partner asked Godzhayev to send more than a ton of materials containing tantalum to Iran in July 2007 .
Godzhayev was detained after customs officials checked the shipment in a container on a boat due to leave for Iran .
Godzhayev is a citizen of Uzbekistan and could face trial soon .
Godzhayev could be sentenced to 7 years in prison if convicted .
Godzhayev is being held in Astrakhan .
Godzhayev and Godzhayev 's lawyers were not immediately available to comment .

A U.N. representative stated that the conversion of opium resin into heroin is increasingly being done inside Afghanistan but that the chemicals needed to complete the conversion are being smuggled into Afghanistan from other countries .
The U.N. representative requested the international community share more information on known smugglers of the chemicals .
The U.N. stated on 28 July 2008 that the international community should do more to stop chemicals used to convert opium to heroin from reaching Afghanistan and detailed increasing sophistication in Afghanistan 's drug trade .
Afghanistan produces more than 90 percent of the world 's opium .
Opium production in Afghanistan has increased since the U.S. @-@ led invasion removed the Taliban regime in 2001 .
Officials in the American @-@ backed government and Taliban militants are believed to profit from the illicit trade .
U.N. figures show Afghanistan yielded approximately 9000 tons of opium in 2007 which could create more than 900 tons of heroin .
Afghanistan 's representative for the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime Christina Oguz stated the conversion of opium resin into heroin is increasingly being done inside Afghanistan mostly at laboratories in the border regions in the insurgency @-@ plagued South and the East .
Oguz stated to reporters in Kabul that evidence of higher quality Afghan heroin indicates that the people running the labs are getting assistance from chemists who have come from outside the country as foreign consultants .
Oguz stated the chemists originated from countries near the border but did not detail specific countries .
Oguz stated the chemicals needed to make the heroin were being smuggled from China , South Korea , European countries , including Russia , and other parts of the world .
Oguz stated the so-called precursor chemicals such as acetic anhydride also have legal uses including in the paint and pharmaceutical industries .
Oguz stated the chemicals often are legally exported but later diverted to Afghanistan for illicit goals and Afghanistan has no major legal industries that would require such chemicals .
Oguz stated --
Blaming Afghanistan alone for the heroin problem in the world is not correct .
Afghanistan does produce the opium which is the raw material for heroin but it is not possible to make heroin without certain chemicals that are not produced inside Afghanistan and are smuggled into Afghanistan .
More than 200 tons of the chemicals have been seized by Afghan authorities since 2006 but some 13000 tons were needed based on 2007 's opium production figures .
The figures suggest the confiscated amount represented a small fraction of the total smuggled in .
Most seizures of the chemicals occur along the eastern border with Pakistan but a good deal comes via the western border with Iran .
Oguz stated the international community should share more information on known smugglers of the chemicals who were long @-@ established and based in Afghanistan 's neighboring countries .
Western officials are increasingly concerned that Taliban militants are bankrolling the insurgency through the drug trade .
The U.N. briefing comes in the wake of allegations that Afghan President Hamid Karzai protected drug lords for political reasons .

The European Union 's highest court on September 3 , 2008 overturned a verdict to freeze the assets of multiple individuals and groups accused of funding terrorist organizations .
The European Union 's highest court on September 3 , 2008 overturned a 2001 decision by European Union governments to freeze the assets of a Saudi businessman and a Sweden @-@ based charity suspected of funding Al-Qaida terror groups .
The ruling conflicts with a United Nations anti @-@ terror order obliging United Nations Member States to freeze assets of people and entities suspected of funding terror groups .
The European Union 's highest court also stated that the United Nations order failed to offer individuals on a terror blacklist or individuals on the defense any legal rights to a judicial review under European law .
The European Union 's highest court acknowledged that the reasons for freezing the assets of Yasin Al @-@ Qadi and the Al @-@ Barakaat International Foundation may be justified .
It is not known whether European Union nations which have set up a joint terror blacklist will unfreeze the assets .
None of the groups have so far been officially removed from the blacklist because European Union Governments argue the court rulings do not oblige the European Union nations to remove the names from the list but only force the European Union to inform the individuals and groups on the list that the assets have been frozen .
Head of the Saudi @-@ based Muwafaq Foundation Yasin Al @-@ Qadi appealed against the European Union 's decision to freeze proprietary assets .
United States Treasury officials allege the Muwafaq Foundation is an al-Qaida Front used to funnel millions of dollars and euros to al-Qaida .
Al @-@ Barakaat International appealed the European Union 's decision to freeze 1 million Swedish kroner or 152247 United States dollars .
Lawyers for Al @-@ Barakaat International stated that the money was being used to fund aid programs for families in Somalia .
Thomas Olsson stated that the lawyers for Al @-@ Barakaat International would now examine ways of having the assets released to the Somali immigrants in Sweden who used the network to send funds to relatives in Somalia .
Thomas Olsson also stated that the lawyers for Al @-@ Barakaat International have to examine the judicial consequences of the verdict as the sanctions remain on a United Nations level .
The European Union 's highest court stated on September 3 , 2008 that the 27 @-@ nation European Union is required to inform any person whose assets are being frozen why as swiftly as possible after the decision is taken in order to allow the person with frozen assets the right to legal recourse .
Swedish lawyer Thomas Olsson who represented Al @-@ Barakaat in the case approved of the ruling .
This ruling may hinder international efforts to stop the financing of terror groups including al-Qaida .
The ruling overturns an earlier 2005 European Union court decision that rejected the appeals of Al @-@ Qadi and the Al @-@ Barakaat international foundation .
The ruling stated that the lower European Union 's court judgment erred in law by stating that European Union courts had no jurisdiction to review the legality of the contested order to freeze assets of individuals and groups deemed to be funding terror groups by the United Nations .
Other suspects and groups on an European Union terror blacklist have also won legal victories for similar reasons against being listed .
These suspects and groups have so far not had assets unfrozen or names removed from the European Union 's blacklist .
The European Union 's High Court had previously overturned an European Union decision to freeze the assets of the People 's Mujahadeen of Iran .
The People 's Mujahadeen of Iran is an exiled Iranian Resistance movement that is on the European Union 's terror blacklist .
The European Union 's High Court recently overturned a decision to freeze the assets of an exiled Philippine rebel leader and the Netherlands @-@ based Al @-@ Aqsa Foundation because the leader and group were not informed why the assets were frozen which is a breach of EU law .

The charges are being dropped because Ronnie jaccobson can not provide that the men had intended to send money to terrorist organizations .
The Swedes were accused of using the informal money transfer networks called hawalas to send funds to alleged terror groups in Somalia .
The 3 Swedes were arrested in raids in Stockholm in February .
The raid was coordinated with a crackdown in Norway where another 3 suspects were arrested on similar grounds .

Taiwanese Vice President Annette Lu warned that European transfer of European technology to the People 's Republic of China could encourage the PRC government to invade Taiwan .
Taiwanese Vice President Annette Lu warned on 040212 that the transfer of European technology to the People 's Republic of China could encourage the PRC government to invade Taiwan .
Lu noted that the European Union adopted a resolution to ban arms sales to mainland China after the Tiananmen massacre of 890000 and said it is worrisome that the leaders of France and Germany are reportedly seeking to lift the ban following years of commercial interest enticements by the PRC government .
Lu expressed concern that European advanced technology will be transferred to the mainland and added that such transfers would be helpful for the PRC government 's military buildup and will therefore encourage an invasion of Taiwan by the mainland .
Lu said that the government of mainland China has tried to isolate Taiwan diplomatically and has been increasing its military buildup against Taiwan .
Lu said the PRC government has deployed around 500 missiles targeting Taiwan and the number of missiles deployed is expected to increase to 650 next year .
Lu described the PRC government as a real international terrorist because of the threat of missiles aimed at Taiwan and the PRC 's preparations to invade Taiwan .
Lu added that this is why Taiwanese President Chen Shui @-@ bian called for a peace referendum for 040320 alongside the Taiwanese presidential election .
Lu said European nations should not join the PRC government in opposing Taiwan 's planned referendum .
Lu said that Taiwan is not a part of the People 's Republic of China and has maintained substantive relations with almost all countries around the world even though most of them do not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan .
Taiwan has never ceased making efforts to participate in international activities and has made great contributions to global development despite being refused membership by many international organizations .
Lu 's remarks were made at Taiwan 's presidential office while receiving the mayor of the Austrian city of Innsbruck Hilde Zach .
Zach arrived in Taipei Tuesday for a 6 @-@ day visit at the invitation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Zach hopes to gain a better understanding of Taiwan 's development in the political , economic , cultural and tourism fields .

Taiwan Executive Yuan may not approve Taiwanese participation in the construction of submarines sold from the United States .
A delegation of Taiwanese legislators completed an 11 @-@ day fact @-@ finding trip to the United States .
The Taiwan Executive Yuan submitted a NT $ 610.8 billion ( US $ 18.23 billion ) special budget to buy 388 Patriot PAC-III missiles , 8 conventional submarines and 12 P-3 C anti @-@ submarine aircraft from the United States earlier this month .
The budget is now pending approval by the Legislative Yuan .
Ker Chien @-@ ming , the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) whip at the Taiwan legislature said on 040628 that discussions are turning negative in regard to whether the China Shipbuilding Corp. ( CSBC ) should take part in the construction of submarines which the United States has promised to sell to Taiwan .
Navy Commander-in-Chief Miao Yung @-@ Ching called on the Legislative Yuan to communicate on the review of the arms procurement budget of which the submarine deal is a part .
Miao said it is not feasible for CSBC to take part in the construction of the submarines and that the Navy will negotiate with the United States on obtaining repair capacity and technology transfers .
Miao said that no countries want to buy conventional submarines .
This would make it futile to give the CSBC the capacity to build them .
The United States has control of the key technology in building the submarines .
Lee Wen @-@ chung is another DPP legislator who has been involved .
Lee said on 040628 that the delegation asked the United States to shorten the delivery period of the submarines from 15 years to 10 years .
This indicates that Taiwan has already given up the policy of building the submarines itself .
Lee said that if the submarines are not built by Taiwan then the cost of the eight subs will be NT $ 100 billion less than the original plan of NT $ 400 billion .
Lee 's figures were based on the price tags of submarines sold from Germany and Spain along with the cost of obtaining repair capacity .
Lee was asked if the long delivery period of 10 years might affect Taiwan 's military strength and tip the military cross @-@ Taiwan Strait balance toward mainland China after 050000 .
Lee answered that any possible naval military balance tilting toward the PRC after 050000 would not mean an eruption of war at that time .
Lee claimed that Taiwan still enjoys the edge in the air .
Lee added that an order of Kidd @-@ class destroyers due to arrive at Taiwan by the end of next year would allow Taiwan to still maintain its edge .
Lee also said that the United States will deliver the first 5 of 12 P-3 C aircraft in 080000 , with another 3 in 090000 , 4 in 100000 and the final 4 in 110000 .

China 's military budget has grown in recent years leading some to believe that China is attempting to achieve global dominance .
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman and Taiwan 's top China policy planner Joseph Wu stated on March 4 , 2007 that China 's substantial military budget increase of 17.8 percent reveals an attempt at achieving global dominance .
Joseph Wu made his statement after China made public the Chinese draft budget bill for 2007 .
Joseph Wu stated that China is attempting to achieve global dominance because the significant budget increase , the lack of transparency in military buildup , the rapid expansion of air and naval forces , and progress in space defense technology suggests an attempt at global dominance .
Joseph Wu stated that China 's annual military spending has experienced double @-@ digit growth since 1993 .
Joseph Wu also stated that growth in China 's military expenditure is not expected to slow down in the foreseeable future but will instead accelerate and become a long-term trend .
Joseph Wu stated that China 's continued military budget growth deserves global attention and concern because there is no apparent threat and no potential future threat to China 's security in sight .
Joseph Wu stated that China 's threat to Taiwan and other neighboring Asia @-@ Pacific countries is rising .
Joseph Wu and Western military experts stated that China 's actual military budget is about 3 times the officially declared figure .
Joseph Wu stated that Taiwan 's plan to procure 3 expensive weaponry systems , 8 diesel @-@ electric submarines , 6 Patriot PAC III anti @-@ missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3 C anti @-@ submarine aircraft is aimed at strengthening the defense capability of Taiwan in light of China 's military buildup .

The the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( moea ) approved lingsen precision industries , King yuan electronics , IC Assembly company Sigurd Corp. and Siliconware precision industries for Chinese investment .
On 8 April 2008 the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( moea ) announced approval for 4 Chinese investment proposals from Chinese manufacturers .
Lingsen precision industries , King yuan electronics , IC Assembly company Sigurd Corp. and Siliconware precision industries were approved for investment and will invest in integrated circuit packaging ( ICP ) and testing .
The companies will invest 10 million US dollars , 20 million US dollars , 6.7 million US dollars , and 50 million US dollars respectively .
The proposals have a total investment amount of 86.7 million US dollars ( 2.64 billion NT dollars ) .
The moea determined in a meeting on 8 April 2008 that the investment proposals met the clauses in the China Investment procedure issued by the ministry 's Investment Commission .
The Investment Commission 's Executive Secretary Fan Liang @-@ Tung stated the investment procedure aims to ensure Taiwan 's investments in China will not harm Taiwan 's industries and economy such as by leaking key technologies to the mainland .
Under the procedure investment plans require approval from the moea if the plans involve a single investment that exceeds 100 million US dollars , the company 's total investment in China reaches 200 million US dollars , or the investment could transfer core local industries @' technologies to China .
Fan stated core industries mainly involve the manufacturing of 8 @-@ inch wafers and 4 @-@ inch TFT panels as well as IC packaging .
After the meeting on 8 April 2008 the Commission requires written documents to further assess the plans which contain each company 's commitment on the terms of investment including the financial plan , information on any technology transfers and the company 's domestic investment as well as employment information .
Fan stated the Commission is primarily concerned with the term of future investment in Taiwan .
Fan stated lingsen precision industries , King yuan electronics , IC Assembly company Sigurd Corp. and Siliconware precision industries have made commitments to return capital to Taiwan in the amounts of 2 billion NT dollars , 19.2 billion NT dollars , 3 billion NT dollars and 23 billion NT dollars respectively by 2011 .
Fan stated the Commission will ensure the commitments are upheld once the investments are under way .
Fan stated the procedure would push Chinese investment from Taiwan to focus on down scale manufacturers rather than technology @-@ concentrated makers in a bid to keep high-end technologies in Taiwan .
Fan stated the Commission will hold a 2 nd round of meetings to decide if the proposals will take effect and that the final decision will be made by 30 April 2008 .

The process to try to control and reduce arms in the embattled Balkans was formally launched in Bonn , Germany , when foreign ministers , ambassadors and representatives of international organizations and observer nations met to discuss what form further talks should take .
The long process to try to control and reduce arms in the embattled Balkans was formally launched on 951218 in Bonn , Germany .
Foreign ministers , ambassadors and representatives of international organizations and observer nations met in Bonn to discuss what form further talks should take .
There are huge obstacles to achieving peace and cooperation among combatants in the former Yugoslavia .
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said in opening remarks at the one @-@ day meeting that there can be no peace in the former Yugoslavia if some parties to the conflict remain heavily armed and others try to catch up .
The Croation delegation threatened to pull out of arms @-@ reduction negotiations if certain demands were not met in the nearest future .
Delegates from other countries called on Croatia , Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia to set aside their grievances and learn to compromise .
Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic complained that a part of Croatian territory is under occupation and time is running out .
Granic said in reference to disputed lands on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border that the peaceful re @-@ integration of Eastern Slavonia is the key to the lasting stability in the region and that everyone faces the danger of another round of hostilities and the destabilization of the whole region and highly unpredictable consequences for Bosnia-Herzegovina without it .
Conference participants said Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic from Serbia scolded his Croatian counterpart for grandstanding .
Then Milutinovic made a threat to pull out of arms @-@ control negotiations .
Milutinovic noted the Serbian Government has been suspended since 920000 from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and said that unless full membership were restored Yugoslavia will be prevented from cooperating despite its readiness to do so .
The OSCE is to oversee the next round of Balkan arms @-@ reduction talks .
Michael Williams is a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and formerly the United Nations @' senior spokesman for Croatia and called the early threats from Croatia and Serbia a worrying development and an ominous development .
Williams said it was really not clear that the parties are willing to engage in any arms control in a meaningful way .
This corresponds to a fear expressed by some delegates to the 951218 Bonn meeting that the yugolav parties do not want to negotiate away the ability to use violence or a threat of violence to seize territory .
Greek Foreign Minister karelos Papoulias observed of the Balkan belligerents that during talk in the plenary session one realizes that this is still the way they are thinking .
Papoulias said the Greek government is not as optimistic as other European partners and that just because there is a Conference does n't mean there is friendship between the people of the former Yugoslavia .
The 951218 talks were organized to fulfill the combatants @' pledge made in Dayton , Ohio , to begin talks to enhance mutual confidence and reduce the risk of conflict within 7 days of the Peace Accord 's formal signing .
The agenda on 951218 was limited to set the formal process for coming weeks .
The German Foreign Ministry said in a statement that this was so as to clear the way for speedy negotiation of the substantive questions .
Croatia , Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia are the nations that signed the Dayton accord and are supposed to report how many tanks and armored vehicles , heavy artillery pieces , combat aircraft and attack helicopters they possess in the next phase .
This data will be used to establish baselines from which weapons ceilings can be agreed on .
Croatia , Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia have promised to accept a set of automatic limits if agreement on such ceilings can not be reached in 180 days .
Kinkel said that on 951218 delegates had been unable to fix a date for the next round of talks but said the next talks would be 960104 or 960107 in Vienna .
Kinkel said minor problems not substantive discord kept delegates from choosing a firm date .

Indian officials seize missile assembly line from the North Korean vessel the kuwolsan on 30 June 1999 .
The discovery heightens suspicions of North Korean weapons proliferation .
On 30 June 1999 Indian customs agents in the northwestern port city of Kandla boarded the North Korean freighter kuwolsan .
Following a melee with the crew of the kuwolsan , customs agents discovered an assembly line for ballistic missiles .
U.S. intelligence officials stated Libyan government was the intended recipient of the cargo .
The kuwolsan departed North Korea 's Nampo harbor on 10 April 1999 .
Records show that on 20 April 1999 the kuwolsan made detours to 2 Thai ports to pick up 14000 tons of sugar for resale along the way to the kuwolsan 's destination .
The kuwolsan switched course in order to sell the sugar to an Indian company after a deal to sell the sugar to Algerians failed .
An Indian investigator stated that the crew of the kuwolsan should not have picked up extra cargo at several ports when carrying 200 tons of sensitive equipment and that such activity was crazy .
Indian customs officials were tipped off to possible contraband on the kuwolsan while the kuwolsan was en route to Kandla .
The kuwolsan was rumored to be carrying arms or ammunition possibly intended for Pakistan .
Indian port officials were waiting when the kuwolsan arrived in Kandla on 25 June 1999 .
Irregularities in the kuwolsan 's papers were apparent within the first few hours of investigation .
Indian officials learned that the company in Malta listed as the intended recipient of the cargo was fictitious .
Indian officials questioned why anyone in Malta would choose to buy water refining equipment from North Korea when Malta is a short flight from Europe .
Indian customs agents questioned the captain of the kuwolsan Tae Min Hun .
Tae blocked every request and threatened international reprisals if Indian officials did not allow Tae to leave Kandla .
On 30 June 1999 customs officials demanded to search the kuwolsan 's cargo boxes and Tae stated that the kuwolsan had received a telex from North Korean officials .
Tae received instructions from officials in Pyongyang to allow no one to open the cargo boxes at all costs .
The official Indian after @-@ action report stated Tae would not open any more boxes as per the telex .
The report stated the crew members shouted at and abused the customs officers .
According to witness accounts and video footage of the encounter , tae and the crew of the kuwolsan barricaded the doors of the kuwolsan with the crews @' bodies .
An Indian official who was present on the kuwolsan and who spoke on the condition of anonymity stated the situation became physical and there were fisticuffs .
The official stated the crew began closing the hatches to the cargo hold with the customs inspectors still inside .
On 1 July 1999 armed troops and a group of government weapons experts aided customs officials and gained forcible entry onto the kuwolsan .
A few crates among the kuwolsan 's cargo contained equipment that could be used in a water treatment plant .
Inspectors found pumps , nozzles and a few valves .
The cargo boxes were labeled as water refinement equipment .
Documents from the investigation contain a partial list of the contents of most of the cargo crates which included --
Components for missile subassembly .
Machine Tools for setting up a fabrication facility .
Instrumentation for evaluating the performance of a full missile system .
Equipment for calibrating missile components .
Rocket nose cones , stacks of metal pipe and heavy @-@ duty presses used for milling high @-@ grade steel .
A Plate @-@ bending machine capable of rolling thick metal sheets , toroidal air bottles used to guide warheads after separation from a missile , and Theodolites that measure missile trajectories .
Several boxes of engineering drawings , blueprints , notebooks , textbooks and reports .
Personal items presumably intended for North Korean workers , including cookbooks in Korean , Korean spices , pickles and acupuncture sets .
An Indian government official familiar with the kuwolsan discovery stated that in the past officials had seen missiles or engine parts , but here was an entire assembly line for missiles offered for sale .
The official stated that this was a complete technology transfer .
A technical committee of Indian missile experts stated that the equipment was unimpeachable and irrefutable evidence of a plan to transfer not just missiles but missile @-@ making capability .
The technical panel wrote in a report that the cargo points to only one end @-@ use , namely the assembling of missiles and manufacture of the parts and subassemblies of surface to surface missiles .
Investigators searched the blueprints that were kept inside numbered plastic jackets and wrapped in brown paper .
Some of the packets were labeled in English as Scud B or Scud C. Nearly all of the drawings showed rockets or sections of rockets with notes and mathematical formulas handwritten in Korean .
Native Korean speakers assisted in translation but the documents contained technical code invented by North Korean scientists to replace scientific terms in Russian or Chinese .
The investigation ultimately yielded information about North Korea 's weapons program which Indian authorities shared with ally Governments .
The Scud B and Scud C designs found on the kuwolsan were from older North Korean missile programs which were derived from Soviet missile designs of the 1950 s .
One Indian government official who studied the blueprints stated the science was old and dated but still functional .
Retired director of the State Department 's Office on strategic , proliferation and military issues in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research Greg Thielmann stated the CIA utilized the blueprints to make full mock @-@ ups of missiles complete with decals .
The blueprints included information pertaining to the inner workings of North Korea 's missile industry which has been the focus of contention between the United States and North Korea since the 1980 s .
The cargo on the kuwolsan did not include everything needed for missile production which raises the possibility that there may have been earlier and possible later shipments .
Missile expert and senior analyst at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies Timothy V. McCarthy examined some of the blueprints and other evidence and stated this was a slice in time of a technology transfer from North Korea to Libya .
McCarthy stated the intelligence find helps U.S. officials learn how North Korean missile scientists learn .
McCarthy stated the information gives U.S. officials an idea of how capable North Korean scientists are of progressing to more advanced missiles and gives U.S. officials insight into the aspect of proliferation when one country 's officials attempt to transfer technology to another country 's officials .
McCarthy stated no one can stop Libyan scientists once the scientists are capable of making missiles .
The kuwolsan and the crew were unaccounted for after Indian officials released the kuwolsan in 2000 .
Shipping experts at Lloyd 's maritime division in London stated the kuwolsan 's name was changed in the summer of 2000 to Sun grisan 9 .
As of the week of 3 August 2003 the sun grisan 9 was still in service and was last reported headed to the Somalian capital of Mogadishu .
The nature of the Sun grisan 9 's cargo was unknown .
As of 14 August 2003 the evidence from the kuwolsan is secured in a military warehouse in New Delhi .
As stated in court documents and interviews with officials in the United States and India the kuwolsan incident has reinforced a view of North Korea as the world 's most dangerous source of weapons proliferation .
In 1999 North Korean leader Kim Jong Il expelled U.N. inspectors , abandoned the Nuclear Non @-@ Proliferation Treaty and declared plans to build an atomic weapon .
U.S. intelligence officials stated that North Korean officials are continuing global trade in technology for weapons of mass destruction including instructions for making advanced missiles .
Successive U.S. administrations have condemned North Korea 's missile sales to such countries as Iran and Syria .
On 31 August 1998 North Korean officials launched a 3 @-@ stage missile which heightened fears of advanced North Korean designs capable of reaching the U.S. mainland .
The first stage splashed down in the Sea of Japan , the second stage crossed the main island of Japan and the third broke up and traveled 3450 miles downrange and fell into the Pacific Ocean .
The missile test fueled work on a U.S. missile defense shield .
North Korean officials have defended the right to sell weapons and have stated that North Korean officials are not bound by international treaties restricting such trade .
North Korean officials have sold missiles and parts to Yemen which received 15 Scud missiles after the missiles were briefly intercepted by U.S. and Spanish naval crews off the Yemeni coast in December 1998 .
Libya appears to be the latest beneficiary of North Korean weapons .
Other nations including Iran , Pakistan and Syria are known to have received similar help .
The kuwolsan cargo attests to the existence of a gray zone composed of a combination of weak States , open borders , lack of controls and a market of buyers and sellers of weapons of mass destruction .
Small packages are sometimes delivered in the luggage of individual airline passengers such as a Taiwanese businessman arrested at Zurich 's airport in 2000 with North Korean missile parts in a rucksack .
Larger items are moved in freighters such as the kuwolsan while technical information and designs are accessible via the Internet .
Korea specialist with the Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California Daniel pinkston stated that intercepting weapons and equipment is difficult but not impossible but that human exchanges of plans , data , and intellectual property are difficult to intercept .

China confirmed on January 23 , 2007 after 12 days of silence that China had fired a guided missile into space to destroy one of its satellites .
The test caused protests from the United States and other nations .
Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said the United States and other Governments have now been informed about the secret test through diplomatic channels .
Liu Jianchao stated that the use of anti @-@ satellite technology does not mean China has abandoned its long @-@ standing opposition to the military use of space .
Liu Jianchao said at a ministry briefing that the test was not targeted against any country and does not pose a threat to any country .
Liu Jianchao said that no plans for another such test by the secretive Chinese military .
The Chinese test shot destroyed an overage weather satellite 537 miles above Earth and was detected by U.S. monitors January 11 , 2007 .
The Chinese government refused to discuss it .
The test raised concern in the United States .
Officials and analysts interpreted it as a signal that U.S. military satellites could be vulnerable to attack by China .
China 's ability to shoot down satellites could pose an added threat in the event of hostilities over Taiwan because the U.S. military relies on satellites for reconnaissance , navigation , weapons guidance systems and anti @-@ missile defenses .
China 's newly demonstrated ability could threaten Taiwanese satellites monitoring Chinese short @- and medium @-@ range missile deployments along the Taiwan Strait .
U.S. officials were dismayed by the Chinese test because the United States and Russia have abstained from such tests after testing anti @-@ satellite technology in the 1980 s .
This decision was partly because destroying satellites creates debris that could damage satellites in nearby orbits .
Liu declined to address questions on this danger .
Experts estimate that several hundred thousand debris fragments were created by the destruction of the satellite .
The satellite orbited in a section of space where 125 other satellites fly .
China has started an accelerated military modernization program and has repeatedly stated its desire to be able to compete in 21 st @-@ century warfare .
This includes the use of advanced electronics and information systems .
The Chinese military runs China 's space program and has identified space @-@ based communications and sensing systems as key to such efforts .
Some Chinese military theorists have advocated asymmetrical warfare .
Pinpoint weapons would be used to disrupt the more advanced and better @-@ equipped U.S. military .
Analysts believed that the January 11 , 2007 test was part of the military modernization program despite China 's frequent declarations that it wants to prevent an arms race in space .
Liu repeated the long @-@ standing Chinese position when asked about the appearance of a contradiction and said China will further promote de @-@ weaponization and the peaceful use of outer space .
China has consistently advocated at the United Nations for the peaceful development of space and pushed for an international agreement to prevent it from becoming the theater for a new arms race .
The United States has opposed China 's suggestion for an international conference to pursue such an accord and argued there is no need for it .
Liu was asked whether the anti @-@ satellite test violated the spirit of China 's proclaimed position and why China kept silent for nearly two weeks while officials around the world were discussing it on the basis of U.S. intelligence reports .
Liu said China has nothing to hide .
China made the response about the test quickly after the relevant parties expressed their concerns .
China stressed that opposition of weaponization and an arms race in outer space .
China 's position has not changed .

An interior ministry spokesman told local newspapers that the arrested men had been involved in financing recruiters who sign up young Saudis to go into turbulent areas .
That is generally a reference to Iraq .
The spokesman said sizable amounts of cash had been found during searches of the men 's homes .
Many young Saudi radicals have crossed the long and porous border between the Kingdom and Iraq and joined up with Sunni Muslim insurgents there .
Alim said that the government 's accusations were baseless and that his clients were well @-@ known reformists with no connection to terrorism .
Alim said the men might have been raising funds for Palestinian or Iraqi refugees .
The men had been warned repeatedly by the government not to gather or write petitions because authorities feared the rise of a new political reform movement .
Alim said the men do not want any kind of organized reform movement .
The men are trying to stop any organized calls for reform .
Alim said police had illegally searched the men 's homes without warrants and seized files , books and computers .
This was after midnight on February 2 , 2002 .
Neither Alim nor family members have been allowed to see the arrested men .
Faleh did not know why they were not allowed lawyers or charged publicly or shown proof or evidence if they are guilty of the crime .
The arrests were the first to target democracy activists since reform @-@ minded King Abdullah took the throne in 2005 and pardoned Faleh and two other leading activists who had spent 18 months in prison .
A dozen other men arrested with them in March 2004 signed statements pledging to stop lobbying for political freedoms .
Faleh and the two others refused to sign and demanded legal representation and a public trial .
Legal Defense and public trials are allowed under Saudi law but rarely applied .
Most defendants go to court without attorneys .
Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy and has a consultative council appointed by the government .
It carried out limited municipal elections in 2005 .
The Kingdom continues to show little tolerance for political opposition despite slow progression toward reform from Abdullah .
It imposes strict limits on freedom of expression and bans public gatherings and political parties .

China has built and launched a communications satellite for Nigeria .
The satellite demonstrate 's China 's increasing skill in space technology .
Chinese officials stated on May 14 , 2007 that China had launched a Chinese manufactured communications satellite into orbit on behalf of Nigeria .
Chinese officials stated that the geostationary satellite will provide communications services over Africa and parts of the Middle East and Southern Europe .
The Chinese officials also stated that the satellite will go into operation by the end of 2007 and is expected to last 15 years .
The satellite will be managed from a control station in Abuja , Nigeria .
This launch marks the first time China has built a commercial satellite and put the satellite into orbit on contract for another country .
The launch occurred on May 14 , 2007 before dawn near the Xichang space center in southwestern Sichuan province .
Some view the launch as another sign of China 's increasing skill in space technology and China 's determination to be among the world 's great powers seeking to utilize the reaches of outer space for benefits on earth .
China 's space program 's rapid progress has caused worries in the United States because the program is run by the military and China has been recently emphasizing space @-@ based information warfare .
The concern intensified following the successful January 11 , 2007 test @-@ firing of an anti @-@ satellite missile .
Some analysts stated that the test @-@ firing demonstrated a risk to the many satellites on which United States military forces rely for navigation and weapons guidance .
China 's space agency sent 2 astronauts into orbit in October 2005 in the Agency 's second manned spaceflight .
The Chinese government on May 7 , 2007 adopted a 10 year plan for expanded space exploration .
The plan includes more manned flights as well as unmanned probes of the Moon and beyond .
Chinese officials stated that the launch of the nigcomsat @-@ 1 aboard a Long March 3 B rocket on May 14 , 2007 represented a commercial challenge .
Some saw the launch as a symbol of China 's broad network of economic relations with Africa .
The official New China News Agency stated that the satellite represents China 's wish to cooperate with developing countries in the peaceful use of outer space and to promote a closer relationship between China and African countries .
Nigeria 's managing director of the nigcomsat @-@ 1 project Hammed Rufai stated that the launch was a breakthrough in ending the exclusive reliance on oil because the satellite will help Nigeria move toward knowledge @-@ based industries .
The official New China News Agency stated that China secured the 311 million dollar contract in 2004 in a bidding process in which 21 other companies took part .
President of the Great Wall Industry Corporation Wang Haibo stated that the Nigerian contract puts China onto the short list of countries that can build , launch and maintain a satellite for other nations .
Chinese officials stated that about 30 similar contracts have been signed for future launches .
In the 1990 s China frequently launched satellites for other countries after the satellites were manufactured elsewhere and acquired a reputation for providing such services more cheaply than other launch @-@ capable countries .
China had been trying to establish commercial relations with oil @-@ producing nations such as Nigeria as the Chinese economy grows nearly 10 percent a year .

Mexico 's drug @-@ trafficking wars continued during the funeral of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old boy .
The boy died in a drowning accident unrelated to drug trafficking .
The boy 's grandfather was Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo .
Gallardo is the fugitive Founder of the Tijuana drug cartel .
June 4 , 2007 6 hooded gunmen entered the traditional all @-@ night wake and shot two people , killing both .
One newspaper called the gunmen commandos .
The gunmen had written Z 's on the victims @' backs before the left .
The Z is a symbol of the Gulf cartel .
At least 46 more people were killed by the end of the week .
There were multiple attacks including hand @-@ grenade assaults and decapitations , with police , federal agents and rival drug @-@ traffickers the principal victims .
The killings show the scope of the violence and the tactics of psychological warfare behind it .
The killings are dispersed across the country .
Many deaths appear to involve disputes between competing bands of traffickers .
At least one of those bands appears to be splitting into different groups .
Authorities in Tuxtepec on June 5 , 2007 found a severed head with a note .
The note stated that this is going to happen to all the people who work with the zetas .
It referred to the hit men who work for the Gulf cartel .
The message was signed as the new blood .
Tuxtepec is in the southeast side of Oaxaca .
The new blood refers to a group of Gulf cartel operatives who have turned against the zetas as members of the organization bid to control trafficking routes and local drug markets .
Mexico 's Secretary of Public Safety Genaro Garcia Luna said in May 2007 that the Gulf cartel had split into rival bands .
Garcia Luna said in a recent press conference that the extreme violence in Mexico was part of a strategy by drug traffickers to force authorities into a strategic retreat .
Garcia Luna said that they are trying to create a climate of intimidation and fear in order to gain operational advantages .
Luna said the residents of a rural town or urban neighborhood will refuse to cooperate with authorities and create a social space of support for traffickers if they believe that drug traffickers can not be defeated .
Gruesome killings have become frequent during the war this year .
New incidents of violence have arisen every day this week .
Authorities on June 6 , 2007 discovered a decapitated body left with a written message for State police in the port city of Veracruz on the Gulf of Mexico .
The message said police were protecting rival drug traffickers and that the decapitated man had been selling drugs for a rival group .
Four other people were killed in and around Veracruz that same day .
This included a funeral Director who had transported the body of Efrain Torres to a cemetery in the city of Poza Rica in May .
Torres was an assassinated leader of the zetas .
The body later was stolen from its crypt .
Another victim of the violence in Veracruz can not yet be tallied among the dead .
Business owner Roberto moguel Martinez was kidnapped by armed men on June 6 , 2007 after being released from a hospital .
Martinez had been recovering from wounds suffered in a May 31 , 2007 attack .
Martinez 's mother wrestled briefly with Martinez 's armed kidnappers on a street in the center of the city according to the Veracruz newspaper notiver .
Martinez has not been seen since .
On June 7 , 2007 there were three grenade attacks on two police stations and an army barracks in the southern state of Guerrero .
Authorities said seven people were killed in apparent drug @-@ related attacks there .
The websites of Mexico City newspapers on June 8 , 2007 reported as many as 20 people had been gunned down nationwide in drug @-@ related violence the previous 24 hours .
The dead included three people shot on a highway in the State of Durango in northwest Mexico .
This happened on a week when President Felipe Calderon traveled to Europe to meet with Pope Benedict XVI and other leaders .
Calderon told reporters on June 4 , 2007 in Rome that consumers in the United States were to blame for the drug @-@ driven chaos in Mexico .
Calderon said that this is a shared problem between the United States and Mexico .
The principal cause is the use of drugs .

The International Atomic Energy Agency reached an agreement with Iranian officials that stated there were no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding Iran 's nuclear program and activities .
U.S. and European officials suspect that Iran 's civilian nuclear energy program masks an effort to obtain technology that could be used in the production of an atomic bomb .
U.S. and European officials suspect that Iran 's civilian nuclear energy program masks an effort to obtain technology that could be used in the production of an atomic bomb .
U.S. and European officials may impose a 4 th round of sanctions on Tehran when the U.N. Security Council considers the issue of Iran 's nuclear energy program most likely in September 2007 .
The International Atomic Energy Agency distributed limited copies of the IAEA report before a meeting on 11 September 2007 of the 35 members of the IAEA board .
The findings reflect an agency agreement on 21 August 2007 with Tehran that Iranian officials began publicizing the week of 12 August 2007 .
The accord said that there were no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding Iran 's nuclear program and activities .
According to an account by Reuters news agency the IAEA report said the work plan is a significant step forward .
Reuters quoted a senior U.N. official as stating the Iranian government 's efforts to enrich uranium had slowed .
The IAEA report stated that Iranian officials must continue to build confidence about the scope and nature of Iran 's present and future nuclear program .
Iranian officials on 30 August 2007 stated cooperation with the IAEA possibly to prevent a further round of international sanctions .
Iran 's representative to the IAEA Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated to Tehran 's Fars news agency that the report emphasized that there exists no sign or evidence indicating diversion of Iran 's nuclear activities and that all of Iran 's nuclear materials have been audited .
Some Nonproliferation Experts stated the IAEA was ceding too much to Iran .
Arms @-@ control experts David Albright and Jacqueline Shire of the Washington @-@ based Institute for Science and International Security wrote in a criticism published the week of 19 August 2007 that the idea of closing files violates fundamental safeguards principles and that the agreement does not specify that Iranian officials would provide the IAEA access to key people , facilities , and documents that are needed to verify Iranian answers to the IAEA 's questions .
Independent experts stated Iran 's latest agreement with the IAEA which gives inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information falls short of the West 's demand to halt the production of concentrated uranium that could potentially be used for a bomb .
U.S. State Department spokesman for the Bush administration Tom Casey stated that while the report may offer some new details or insight into the development of Iran 's program Iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program .
Casey stated the fact that the nuclear program continues to move forward shows that the Iranian regime is continuing on a path of defiance of the international community .
Most Western Nonproliferation Experts stated the Agreement on 21 August 2007 contained little that could dissuade policymakers in Washington , London , Paris and Berlin from moving forward with another round of Security Council sanctions .
Experts stated many of the transparency issues reportedly resolved in the Agreement on 21 August 2007 should have been resolved previously .
Executive Director of nonpartisan Washington think tank the Arms Control Association Daryl G. Kimball stated the agreement does not address the problem that the Iranian government is pursuing an enrichment technology and capability that could lead to the production of nuclear bomb material .
Kimball stated the Iranian government 's design is to deflect criticism and pressure and to claim that progress is being made .
Iranian officials stated a possible reduction in collaboration with inspectors in the event of more sanctions .
The Security Council has voted unanimously to impose sanctions against Iran but the penalties have been limited from U.S. demands under Chinese and Russian pressure .
SOLTANIEH stated in an interview with state @-@ controlled Iranian television that the report and the measures taken make the intervention of any other international organization including the Security Council irrelevant and unjustified .

Documents outlining the Israeli proposal to allow the international transfer of nuclear technology to States that have not signed on to nonproliferation rules were distributed to the Nuclear Suppliers Group .
The proposal may complicate the Bush administration 's efforts to win an exemption for India to engage in nuclear trade .
Israeli officials convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines allowing the international transfer of nuclear technology to States that have not signed on to nonproliferation rules .
Countries including India , Israel and Pakistan that have not signed the nuclear Non @-@ Proliferation Treaty are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade which includes purchasing reactors , uranium fuel or yellowcake .
Documents outlining the Israeli proposal were distributed to the 45 @-@ member Nuclear Suppliers Group ( NSG ) in March 2007 .
The Israeli presentation was made in a nonpaper that allows for official deniability .
According to a letter from the Chairman of the NSG on 17 March 2007 the Israeli presentation was offered in the context of the NSG 's debate over Indian officials @' bid for an exemption .
Among the nations that have not signed the Treaty only India and Israel would qualify for admission to the NSG under the Israeli proposal .
The Israeli plan offered 12 criteria for allowing nuclear trade with non @-@ treaty states .
1 criterion indicated Israel 's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state and said a State should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if the State applies stringent physical protection , control and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons , nuclear facilities , source material and special nuclear material in the State 's territory .
The documents circulated on Capitol Hill in September 2007 as the Bush administration worked toward an agreement with Indian officials .
Executive Director of the Arms Control Association in Washington Daryl Kimball stated the Israeli document could affect the debate over India .
Kimball stated --
The dynamics at the NSG are that officials from the countries do not want to be obstacles to India which is the largest country and the United States which is the most powerful country .
Consensus on India will be difficult to reach when the NSG meets in November 2007 .
Israel 's proposal gives officials from some countries reason to suggest an alternative approach to a specific exemption .
Israel 's record is good and better than India 's in following international nuclear rules .
Despite ties between Israeli and U.S. governments the Bush Administration rejected the Israeli proposal .
The proposal may complicate the Bush administration 's efforts to win an exemption for India to engage in nuclear trade .
President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice view the Pact as an important part of the Bush administration 's foreign policy legacy .
The deal is controversial in India and Congress must give approval .
Delays in winning approval for the India deal could have a negative effect on the administration 's foreign policy legacy with delay until an election year having the most negative effect .
State Department spokesman Tom Casey stated the U.S. government views the India deal as unique and does not see the deal as a precedent for any other country including Israel .
Spokesman for the Israeli embassy David Siegel stated the suggestion that the Israeli government is demanding an exemption or linking efforts to any other issue including the India debate is grossly inaccurate .
Seigel stated --
The Israeli government has never asked the NSG for any exemption to nuclear supply guidelines or made any Israeli @-@ specific request of the NSG .
Israel is recognized as a full @-@ fledged adherent to the NSG Guidelines .
The Israeli government has urged the NSG to consider adopting a generic , multi @-@ tiered , criteria @-@ based approach towards nuclear technology transfers .
Some officials from NSG countries have previously suggested an approach like the Israeli plan .
If modification of the NSG Guidelines were to take place along the lines proposed by Israeli officials the nuclear nonproliferation regime would be considerably enhanced .

Ahmadinejad announces expansion of Iranian uranium @-@ producing capability .
Iran refuses commitment to halt expansion but hints a possible future halt .
20080726 Iranian President Mahmoud ahmadinejad stated to scholars in the northeastern city of mashbad that Iran had expanded its arsenal of centrifuges producing enriched uranium to over 5000 .
The statement was ahmadinejad 's first asserting an expansion since the 20080400 announcement that Iran was approaching the implementation of 6000 centrifuges .
Iran articulated the goal of 50000 centrifuges operating at the enrichment plant near the town of Natanz .
The international community has demanded that Iran halt the production of nuclear material .
Media reports differed on the number of centrifuges ahmadinejad cited .
An Iranian news agency reported that ahmadinejad stated Iran had 6000 working centrifuges but the agency subsequently removed the statement from the Internet .
Another Iranian news agency stated that ahmadinejad referred to 100000 s of centrifuges .
Experts discounted the significance of ahmadinejad 's claim in the absence of information on the centrifuges @' functionality .
A Western diplomat in Tehran speaking under condition of anonymity stated that the quantity of centrifuges is less important than whether the machines are operational and efficient but that ahmadinejad 's assertion will hinder a resolution of the diplomatic standoff between Iran and the West .
Arms control expert Jeffrey G. Lewis of the new America Foundation think tank stated that the Foundation was aware of Iran 's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but the operational status of the machines is unknown .
Diplomats and arms control experts stated that the Iranian enrichment program is hindered by technical problems .
Iran has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear program aims to produce only electricity because nuclear weapon production contradicts Islamic principles .
The US , Israel , Europe and the majority of Western arms control experts believe that Iran is pursuing the capability to produce bombs immediately in the event of a decision .
Experts stated that producing weapons @-@ grade uranium from reactor @-@ grade material is relatively simple .
Ahmadinejad stated that after Iran resisted the West 's demands for a halt in nuclear activities , the West still pursued the resumption of negotiations .

20080726 during talks in Geneva attended by US Undersecretary of State William J. Burns Iran refused to respond to Solana 's offers .
The talks constituted the highest @-@ level diplomatic contact between the US and Iran for nearly 30 years .
Solana , burns and European envoys set a deadline for Iran to respond positively before initiating new sanctions including prohibitions on selling Iran refined petroleum products vital to the country 's economy .
Iranian officials refused to commit to stopping expansion or to observe the deadline .
20080726 ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that Iran might potentially halt expansion at a higher number of centrifuges that previously expected and for over 6 weeks .
Ahmadinejad stated that the West had consented to the existing 5000 @-@ 6000 centrifuges in operation provided that the number did not increase .
5000 centrifuges can produce sufficient nuclear material for a power plant or an atomic bomb if the material is highly enriched .

Russian and Western officials have stated that there is enough uncertainty that they could not be positive a loss of power at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology would not cause a public health threat .
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology has quite reliable systems of protection in case of emergency .
General Nikolai N. Urakov is the longtime director of the the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology .
The State scientific center of applied microbiology has been working with Western scientists to convert the complex into a biomedical manufacturing site .
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that the people at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology are scared by this threat of a sudden shutdown of electricity because it is a kind of psychological pressure on the people at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology .
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that in the event of a power shutdown at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology scientists must destroy all bacteriological experiments under way .
General Nikolai N. Urakov would like the United States and Western countries that have contributed about 6 million United States dollars to the transformation of the former bioweapons complex to contribute another 500000 United States dollars per year to pay the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology 's electric bills and arrears .
An American scientist who works closely with the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology stated that the Russian government was responsible for paying for the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology 's electric bills .
Western aid for conversion of General Nikolai N. Urakov 's one time bioweapons laboratory peaked in 970000 because it was learned that Iran had made offers to the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology to purchase its expertise .
Russian scientists and military leaders who now depend on Western financing to destroy nuclear , chemical and biological weapons have been known to orchestrate a sense of crisis to increase financing .
American scientist Randall Lee Beatty is working on the conversion of the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology in obolensk .
Beatty stated that this threat to cut electricity to the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology is a crisis .
Randall Lee Beatty is a Director of the International Science and Technology Center .
The International Science and Technology Center finances approximately half of General Nikolai N. Urakov 's budget to support about 350 Russian biowarfare scientists and technicians .
Randall Lee Beatty stated that it is known that the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology has not paid its electricity bill for 14 months .
Randall Lee Beatty stated that the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology is one of the important archives for dangerous pathogens in the world and it would be a shame if those archives were destroyed for not paying the electricity utility .
Approximately 3000 strains of bacteria are stored at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology and many of the bacteria are stored in cryogenic casks cooled with liquid nitrogen and isolated from the environment by layered enclosures and oversize air @-@ handling systems that all depend on electricity to function .
The greatest danger from a shutdown of electric power at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology would be the defrosting of live germs that are currently preserved in a frozen state .
A biological warfare expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies named Raymond zilinskas stated that the main threat from cutting power to the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology would be to the organisms themselves rather than that they might escape .
Raymond zilinskas stated that in the worst case the bacteria would be defrosted from minus 70 degrees and it would be a real mess to clean up afterward because it would not be known for certain whether all the bacteria was dead .
The confrontation between the mosenergo electric utility and the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology in obolensk is another example of how the basic capitalist imperative for enterprises to be self @-@ sustaining can clash in a dangerous way with the old remnants of Soviet weapons science .
Due to an overdue power bill in 000000 the Russian National Power Company cut off electricity to a strategic base where nuclear missiles stood on high alert .
The nuclear missile silos themselves did not lose power .
Armed troops marched to the substations and turned the power back on .
In 010100 and 010200 the national utility , United energy systems cut power to a number of military installations around Russia .
The military installations that lost power included the Russian space forces monitoring center on the Kamchatka Peninsula .
In most cases of military installations having their electricity cut off the electricity has been quickly restored .
Often investigations show that the tug of war with the utility forces the military to spend budgeted funds for electrical power instead of diverting money for other uses .
Some of the budgeted funds cut at times have included the building country residences for generals .

The US is scheduled to provide 10.2 million dollars in drug and law enforcement aid to Brazil in 2004 .
Former air force chief and current Director of the Air Institute at estacio de sa University in Rio de Janeiro General Mauro Jose Miranda gandra stated that the measure was a courageous step by the Government but the impact may be more political than practical because of self @-@ imposed restrictions by the Brazilian government .
Brazilian officials stated that the policy would be inapplicable against aircraft with children on board .
Viegas stated that the limitation was necessary .
Gandra stated that the provision undermines the decree 's essential purpose by granting immunity to drug @-@ smuggling aircraft carrying children and thus introducing the possibility of kidnapped children being used as human shields .
Viegas stated in an interview in Brasilia that the government will use the law to more powerfully dissuade drug traffickers who have previously entered Brazilian airspace feeling unthreatened by the air force .
The Government was prompted to act due to the deteriorating public security situation with increasingly powerful and violent drug gangs in Sao Paolo and particularly Rio de Janeiro .
Rio de Janeiro drug gangs have more firepower than the police and have successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close .
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stated in a 2003 interview with foreign correspondents --
The policy is a matter of national sovereignty and security .
Some pilots of drug @-@ running aircraft felt so confidently immune from retribution as to make obscene gestures at pursuing Brazilian air force pilots .
The constitutionality of the law has been questioned under Brazil 's prohibition of the death penalty as punishment for criminal acts .
Some legal experts and other commentators stated that contrary to government claims , the Statute amounts to a de facto execution of drug traffickers .
The daily newspaper O Estado de Sao Paolo stated in an editorial the week of 20040718 @-@ 20040824 -- the extreme measure raises ethical and juridical problems exceeding any potential benefits .
The penalty will be applied extrajudicially by administrative decision of the Commander of the Air Force .
This person will gain life and death power over crew members and passengers of irregular flights .
In 2002 Brazil inaugurated the 1.4 billion dollar SIVAM radar system allowing the government to monitor air activity throughout the expansive Amazon region for the first time .
The system uses American technology .
Illegal Flights initially declined 30 percent due to trafficker 's concerns about improved tracking capabilities but subsequently reaccelerated .
Brazil recorded 4128 unauthorized flights in 2003 .
Some of these flights were innocent violations by ranchers in the Amazon flying between plantations .
Viegas stated that there was a significant increase in deliberate violations of Brazilian airspace , apparently by drug smugglers realizing that the government was incapable of retaliation .

The Venezuelan president 's weapons deals with Russia , curbs on military cooperation with the United States , and his plans to train as many as 2 million Venezuelan civilians to repel a possible invasion by superpowers have the US and his domestic critics worried .
Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez 's weapons deals with Russia , curbs on military cooperation with the United States , and plans to train as many as 2 million Venezuelan civilians to repel a possible invasion by imperialist superpowers have the United States and Chavez 's domestic critics worried about what the leftist former military officer is planning .
Chavez insists that the moves are purely defensive and born of an overdue need to update obsolete military hardware and protect Venezuela from nations that might want to take control of Venezuela .
Venezuela is South America 's largest petroleum @-@ producing state .
Chavez 's domestic opponents scoff at the idea that the US would ever invade Venezuela and charge that Chavez 's true intention is to arm a huge cadre of loyal reservists who would protect Chavez against any internal uprising and to pose as a militarized counterweight to US influence in Latin America .
Cuban leader Fidel Castro is Chavez 's his major ally and Chavez is growing closer to Castro .
Chavez 's detractors in the US government say that it is even more troubling that Chavez 's arms purchases and indoctrination of civilian militias could be part of a strategy to restructure Venezuelan democracy in the image of Cuban @-@ style militarized socialism and foment leftist revolutions throughout South America .
US military strategists say they are increasingly concerned that radical movements inspired by Chavez could foment such revolution .
The political mainstream in Latin America has shifted leftward since the late 1990 s .
This leftward shift is largely in reaction to the perceived failure of free @-@ market economics .
Leftists have been elected to lead Brazil , Argentina , Chile , Uruguay , Ecuador and Venezuela .
Chavez 's supporters at home counter that the United States has a century @-@ long history of open as well as covert armed intervention in Latin America 's domestic politics and say that it has no right to question Venezuela 's defense preparations .
Carlos Roque Espinoza Leon said that Venezuelans never ask what the US Marines are doing .
Espinoza Leon is a pro @-@ Chavez defense specialist who serves in Venezuela 's National Assembly .
Espinoza said that Peru has 500000 rifles and no one says anything .
Espinoza said no one complains that Colombia is the most militarized country in Latin America .
Espinoza said US history is full of aggression in Latin America .
Espinoza said Venezuelans have to do whatever is necessary to protect Venezuela .
Chavez has famously said that the Venezuelan so-called Bolivarian revolution is peaceful but not unarmed .
Chavez was first elected in 980000 and has a popularity rating of 71 percent in an independent poll by polling firm Datanalisis .
Venezuelan military analyst Alberto Garrido said Chavez is looking for allies in Russia , China , and Iran in order to promote a multi @-@ polar world which will counteract US dominance and encourage grassroots Movements in Latin America to throw off US governmental influence .
Lorenzo Campos is a farmer in Anzoategui state in northern Venezuela and is training as a reservist .
Campos said Venezuelans want the world to know that Venezuelans are not preparing to attack anyone and that the mission is to protect Venezuela .
In May , Chavez 's government announced details in 050500 of an $ 18.6 million deal with a Russian firm to purchase 100000 AK-103 assault rifles with 30 rounds of ammunition each and the technology transfer for Venezuela to manufacture the rifles .
The deal works out to $ 186.22 per rifle .
This price is considerably less costly than the US mail @-@ order price of $ 825 to $ 850 for the same weapon .
The Government of Venezuela also intends to buy 10 Russian helicopters , 10 Spanish transport planes , and 6 Spanish naval craft .
Venezuelan officials say the government is negotiating with Brazil to buy around 24 air support and training planes .
Chavez has insisted and even his staunchest retired military Critics here agree that the purchases are essential to update old weaponry such as the military 's decades @-@ old Belgian FAL rifles .
Retired General Fernando OCHOA ANTICH said that it is an exaggeration to say Chavez is engaged in an arms buildup .
Ochoa was defense minister in 920000 when then @-@ Lieutenant Colonel Chavez launched a failed coup .
Ochoa stated that Venezuela has n't purchased arms in 25 years and said and Chavez is not aggressively buying weapons in a way that would threaten his neighbors .
Ochoa said Venezuela has never bought Russian arms before and suggested Chavez is doing it to become independent from the US .
Ochoa asked why Chavez is buying a caliber of rifle which is popular among subversive forces in Latin America and stated that the political support Chavez gives to radical leftist movements makes Chavez a continental menace .
The US Pentagon has openly questioned what Chavez will do with the old FAL rifles and whether Chavez might share weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in Latin America .
The US government has provided no evidence of Chavez arming or funding leftist insurgencies .
Military analysts and specialists on the Colombian FARC guerrillas say the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and would not be interested in old Belgian rifles or in assistance from Chavez .
A 030000 study published by the US Defense Intelligence Agency reported that more than half of the weapons seized from Colombian guerrillas from 980000 to 010000 that had markings of foreign militaries were of Venezuelan origin .
The implication was that corrupt or sympathetic members of the Venezuelan military may be aiding guerrillas .
Perhaps more distressing to Chavez 's domestic opponents is the ideological training that critics say Chavez has in mind for the military and for new civilian reservists .
Chavez called earlier in 050000 for so-called Revolutionary units to start preparing the public to resist a superpower aggressor and said the first step would be to train from 100000 to 2 million volunteers in the coming years to back up active @-@ duty armed forces .
Military analysts estimate Venezuela 's active @-@ duty armed forces number 83,000 .
People 's defense units would be created in neighborhoods , State companies , and the Free University established under Chavez and would report directly to the president .
The government insists the reserves will support the armed forces and not act as a fifth column against a possible anti @-@ Chavez coup .
Espinoza said the reserves are not to be used as shock troops for any political party and that if there were a civil war , it would be up to each person to take their own side .
General Julio Ramon Quintero viloria is commander of the reserves .
Quintero said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50000 civilians over 20 weekends in the second half of 050000 and could train 300000 more in 060000 .
Quintero said that Venezuelans do n't want to be the colony of any empire and have to be ready for any possibility .
100000 reservists in 050600 engaged with the Venezuelan navy in a massive war game to repel a stronger country that had invaded .
40 employees of the state oil company participated in a similar exercise with 1200 soldiers in 050600 .
Pro @-@ Chavez circles here warn of asymmetrical warfare .
Asymmetrical warfare is a term coined by US military strategists to describe a conflict between unequal combatants where the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics .
The US government has given $ 3.3 billion in mostly military aid to Colombia in the past 5 years .
Chavez loyalists fear that the US government could instigate a proxy war between Colombia and Venezuela as a way to oust Chavez and control Venezuelan oil .
A senior US official in an interview dismissed the notion that the United States Government wants to invade Venezuela as complete and utter nonsense .
The official said the chavista side wishes to make the relationship negative because they 've made a political calculation that Mr. Chavez reached power by constantly being in confrontation with the US .
Another development that has troubled the United States is Chavez 's rollback of military cooperation and joint exercises .
The US military had a Cooperation Office for 50 years in a Venezuelan Fort .
Chavez shut it down in 040000 .
5 US military trainers and students participating in an exchange program were ordered to leave the country in 050400 .
Analysts say that it is likely Chavez is trying to indoctrinate his public and armed forces .
Analysts say that there is no proof that Chavez will use those forces to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere .

The North Korean government may be prepared to begin shutting down a plutonium producing reactor in June 2007 as the first step toward disabling the Unit by December 2007 .
Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill stated on 18 June 2007 that the North Korean government may be prepared to begin shutting down a plutonium producing reactor in June 2007 as the first step toward disabling the Unit by December 2007 .
Hill is the head American negotiator on North Korea 's nuclear weapons program .
Hill stated stalled efforts to dismantle North Korea 's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the weekend of 16 June 2007 and 17 June 2007 when Pyongyang officials invited inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit for talks on verifying and monitoring a shutdown .
Following talks with Chinese negotiator Wu Dawei Hill stated the shutdown has long been anticipated .
Hill stated the shutdown could occur in a matter of weeks not months .
The Associated Press reported from Vienna , Austria that the IAEA stated on 18 June 2007 that a team would visit Pyongyang the week of 24 June 2007 to discuss the manner in which inspectors will verify the shutdown .
Hill stated IAEA inspectors will hold talks with Pyongyang officials on sealing the reactor which would include the installation of television monitors at the site .
North Korean officials refused to proceed with a February 2007 agreement to begin decommissioning the Yongbyon reactor until funds worth 25 million dollars in accounts linked to North Korea held in a Macao Bank were transferred to North Korea .
The money was frozen when officials from the United States accused the Banco Delta Asia of complicity in financial crimes on behalf of North Korea .
The funds were wired on 14 June 2007 to the New York Federal Reserve Bank after months of disagreement over the method of returning the funds .
The funds were to be sent to Russia 's Central Bank before a transfer to an account controlled by the North Korea government in a Russian commercial bank .
Hill stated talks will occur the week of 17 June 2007 with disarmament negotiators from Russia , South Korea and Japan on steps to recoup some of the time lost while the financial transfer was being organized .
The discussions will also involve setting a timetable for resumption of 6 @-@ nation arms control talks .
Under the agreement reached in February 2007 North Korean officials pledged to shut down the Yongbyon reactor and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for a 50000 @-@ ton shipment of fuel oil .
North Korean officials will declare all nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for a further 950000 tons of fuel oil in the next phase of the Agreement .

Iran resolved questions about Iran 's past experiments with plutonium with no explanation how .
Senior Fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies mark Fitzpatrick stated that --
The International Atomic Energy Agency plan is superficial .
The International Atomic Energy Agency plan draws out negotiations for many months .

Somali pirates who hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms are approaching a deal for the ship 's release .
Questions have emerged regarding the shipment of arms en route to Kenya and of a possible clandestine arms deal between Kenya and South Sudan .
On 08 October 2008 Maritime officials and associates of the Somali pirates who on 25 September 2008 hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms stated that the pirates may soon be collecting their ransom .
After difficult negotiations likened by several people involved to bazaar @-@ style haggling the parties are close to reaching a deal in which the pirates would be paid millions of dollars and the ship freed .
A businessman in xarardheere , Somalia named Ahmed Omar stated that the pirates and the ship owners have agreed on a ransom of approximately 8 million U.S. dollars and the ship may be freed on 08 October 2008 or 09 October 2008 .
Xarardheere is a notorious pirate base on the coast of Somalia .
Maritime officials in Kenya stated that critical details have yet to be agreed upon .
One such detail involves the pirates @' request for a guarantee that they would not be arrested or attacked by the armada of American warships currently encircling them .
A Kenyan maritime official stated anonymously that such negotiations are complex and involve more than the financial aspect .
On 08 October 2008 the official stated that progress is being made and the parties are approaching an agreement .
The pirates initially requested 35 million U.S. dollars and then reduced their request to 20 million U.S. dollars .
The pirates have consistently expressed willingness to negotiate the financial figures .
More than 25 ships have been hijacked in 2008 off the Somalia coast with a typical ransom of between 1 and 2 million U.S. dollars .
The pirates aboard the Ukrainian ship have stated that upon receipt of payment in American dollars and preferably in 100 dollar bills the ship , its cargo and the 20 sailors on board will be released .
The original country of destination for the arms shipment aboard the Ukrainian ship is being questioned .
Shortly after the freighter was hijacked on 25 September 2008 the Kenyan government claimed that the weapons on board were being shipped for Kenya 's military .
The ship was en route to Kenya 's main port of Mombasa .
The weapons on board the ship included 33 T-72 tanks , 150 grenade launchers , 6 anti @-@ aircraft guns and a large quantity of ammunition .
Evidence has subsequently emerged that the weapons were part of a clandestine arms deal between Kenya and the separatist region of southern Sudan .
The deal would most likely have remained secret had the pirates not hijacked the ship and begun speaking to the media by satellite phone .
Ukrainian officials have been adamant in denying any wrongdoing .
Ukrainian diplomat in Kenya oleh belokolos stated --
Ukraine does not supply or have plans to supply any armaments to the Government of South Sudan .
All the appropriate paperwork has been validated .
Ukraine abides by all United Nations rules and arms control agreements .
Ukraine inherited enormous stockpiles of weaponry after the collapse of the Soviet Union and is now a major arms dealer .
The deal with Ukraine is considered suspicious given that Kenya has mostly relied on the United Kingdom and other western countries for its supply of heavy weapons .
Kenyan politicians were demanding answers and have called for several commissions to examine the situation .
Southern Sudan is an autonomous region that is currently increasing its military and that uses Soviet @-@ designed tanks .
The American military stated that its priority is to ensure that the weapons were not unloaded from the ship and sold to Islamist insurgents in Somalia .

Head of the U.N. drug office Antonio Maria Costa said that Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban are cutting back poppy cultivation and stockpiling raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing for the insurgency .
Head of the U.N. drug office Antonio Maria Costa said that Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban are cutting back poppy cultivation and stockpiling raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing for the insurgency .
Costa said this to reporters last week as the U.N. Drug Office Office prepared to release its latest survey of Afghanistan 's opium crop .
The survey showed that poppy cultivation had retreated in much of Afghanistan and was overwhelmingly concentrated in 7 of 34 provinces where the insurgency remains strong , most of those in the south .
The survey was issued November 27 , 2008 .
The United Nations found that the result was a 19 percent reduction in the amount of land devoted to opium in Afghanistan even though the total tonnage of opium produced dropped by just 6 percent .
The study stated that the high output per acre was attributed to a good growing season in the south .
The southern region is a heavily irrigated area where the Taliban maintained a strong presence in 5 provinces and have systematically encouraged opium cultivation as a way to finance their insurgency for several years .
The U.N. estimates the insurgents made as much as 300 million dollars from the opium trade last year .
Costa said a lot of war effort can be funded with 2 to 300 million dollars .
The Taliban have producing an amount of opium that far exceeds world demand due to 3 successive years of bumper crops .
Costa said the result was a glut that was depressing the price , which dropped by approximately 20 percent .
Costa said that the fact that prices had not collapsed already was evidence that the Taliban , drug lords and even some farmers have stockpiled the opium .
An increasing amount is also being processed in Afghanistan .
Costa added that insurgents have been holding significant amounts of opium .
Costa said the surplus is as much as 11000 tons , or more than twice world demand in the last 3 years and threatened to devalue their stockpiles .
The United Nations found that Afghanistan produced 8500 tons of opium in 2008 .
World demand was estimated at about 4400 tons per year .
The Taliban this year are taking a passive stance toward cultivation and putting less pressure on Afghan farmers to plant opium poppy .
This then supports the current price .
Costa is an Italian diplomat who has served at the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime for 6 years .

Hong Kong universities collaborate with universities , businesses and government sectors of mainland China to coordinate training programs and research centers to promote high-tech research , commercialization , and technology transfer .
In 2004 Hong Kong tertiary institutes actively contributed to improved relations between Hong Kong and mainland China in the research and development of high technology .
Hong Kong universities have collaborated with tertiary education , business and government sectors of mainland China to direct training programs and research centers to promote research commercialization and technology transfer .
In June 2004 Hong Kong Polytechnic University ( PolyU ) joined national university science and technology park of the Virtual University Park in Shenzhen , China becoming the first tertiary institution of Hong Kong to establish research centers and training facilities in mainland China .
President of PolyU Poon Chung @-@ kwong stated that both public and private sectors in Hong Kong are strengthening connections with mainland China in various areas .
Poon stated that cooperation between Hong Kong and mainland China will facilitate universities to more effectively promote technology transfer and human resources development in the mainland creating positive results for both Hong Kong and China .
City University of Hong Kong ( CityU ) and the University of Science and Technology of China ( USTC ) in Anhui province signed an agreement in June to jointly establish a high level joint research center in Suzhou .
The University of Science and Technology of China is a university established by the Chinese Academy of Sciences ( CAS ) .
The agreement is based on the principle of mutually beneficial collaboration in which both universities complement each other 's strengths in working together on joint research projects , supervision and teaching of research students and in administering professional training opportunities .
In addition to partnering with education institutes Hong Kong universities have also joined large-scale high technology exchange programs in mainland China in order to enhance communication between the mainland and Hong Kong in the discipline .

EBay Announces Today It will Acquire Ticket Website StubHub for 310 Million US Dollars
eのsnail
According to the international reports on January 11 , eBay announced that it will acquire online ticket website StubHub for 310 million US dollars in cash to further expand its influence on electronic commerce .
The acquisition is expected to be completed before April .
More than six years ago , Jeff Fluhr and Stanford School of Business graduate Eric Baker founded StubHub with Fluhr as its chief executive officer .
Fluhr said in a statement : " StubHub 's business model is an excellent fit with eBay , and we have admired eBay for a long time . "
Over the past two years , as investors were concerned about the slowdown in eBay 's online auction business , its poor management , slow business expansion , and other factors , its market value has been dwindling .
In succession eBay acquired Internet phone service Skype and online price - comparison company Shopping.com .
StubHub mainly operates ticket brokerage to major events .
In 2006 its ticket sales was 400 million US dollars with annual profits reaching 100 million US dollars .
Ticket sellers selling tickets on this website must pay a 15 percent fee , while buyers also have to pay a 10 percent commission to StubHub .
As of now , five million tickets have been sold on the StubHub website .
Many discoveries are made by chance .

I remember my first year studying at Qinghua , I went to my first elective course called " Inspirations in the History of Physics . "
There were only ten or so of us who had chosen it that semester .
The teacher was very erudite , his lectures were very lively ; he summarized all of the recent and contemporary history of physics , and each time I was enthralled .
In all my five years at the university , I never had another course that interesting .
If I were to summarize this course , it would be : the greatest discoveries in physics all had their own necessity and theoretical basis ( for example , the development of mathematics ) .
This theory can also be applied to cooking .
One day I wanted to make green beans and bean curd sheets ( dried tofu in the Northeast ) .
Here the dried tofu sold in the stores is all compressed , very tough .
So I normally steep it in hot water , then take it out and stir - fry it .
Because that day I needed to go out in the middle of it and buy some things , I set the timer and told my wife to turn off the heat when it was done .
My wife is very lazy , and when the timer sounded , she turned off the heat and left the pot sitting on the stove .
When I came back and looked , the dried tofu was white and soft , just like freshly made .
Chalk another good one up to the wife .
Guo Kai 's Economic Notes : Your uncle is just your uncle .
Guo Kai 's Economic Notes
This morning I went to the supermarket with Dad , and when it came time to check out I discovered something that everybody probably knows : not everybody buys the same things .
Of course this is a no - brainer , but this is actually a major problem faced by me and many other people whenever we discuss economic issues or economic phenomena .
Most of the time , economic policy and economic theory are not aimed at individuals .
In terms of probability , if you explain the behavior of a specific individual , for example your uncle , using any economic theory , the probability that it will be accurate is virtually 0 .
In fact , in the great majority of cases the economic theory is aimed at an entire group , or a subgroup .
In terms of averages , accuracy is the goal of many economic theories ( here I 'm being inaccurate ; I hope the experts will not take it too literally , especially those with IO expertise ) .
But with regard to an ordinary person , he may never see the whole group , he sees only his co @-@ workers , his relatives and his friends , the group of people familiar to him ; add up all the people in this group and they may number 200 , and that is already a lot of people .
Below I am going to refer to these 200 people collectively as " his uncle . "
So whenever you discuss an economic theory with someone , the response of a perfectly ordinary person would be : My uncle is n't like that , so this theory is baloney .
In other words , everybody tends to mistake the part for the whole .
Here , mistaking the part for the whole is not derogatory ; it is a limitation of the human race itself ; you have it and I have it .
If Americans had learned not to mistake the part for the whole , they might not have made such a mess of the world .
I believe that they made such a complete mess of the Middle East to a very large extent because they applied their own common sense to understanding the Middle East , which is a completely different place from the United States .
On this issue , China does not have much basis for being self - congratulatory ; China 's rapid rise has even caused some people to have a sort of misconception - that whatever China does is right - and this is in fact a manifestation of narrow - mindedness .
Therefore I believe it is extremely important to recognize that one 's own knowledge has limitations .
We need to maintain a sufficiently open attitude toward things that do n't correspond to our common sense .
So just because every time your uncle goes to the supermarket he buys hog head meat does n't mean that we should immediately assume that any theory that does not predict people going to the supermarket will buy hog head meat is wrong .
When you feel other people are talking baloney , and what other people say does not correspond to your " common sense , " you should at the same time recognize that your uncle is only your uncle , he is not the whole world .
Well , gasoline in Richmond has has hit $ 3.00 a gallon , or just shy of it ,
and I spent $ 48 filling up the gas tank of my Jeep --
the most I 've ever paid for in my life .
I 'm not happy about it ,
but I do n't see high gas prices as a reason to start foaming at the mouth and chewing on the carpet .
Others feel less constrained .
The hysteria over rising gas prices has reached a fever pitch .
The economic ignorance of the sound bites and commentary I 've seen on national television knows no bounds .
Demagogues are calling for self - destructive taxes on oil company profits , oblivious to the reality that , in a capitalist society , profits are a critical signal that guide the flow of capital .
( 1 ) If you confiscate Exxon Mobil 's profits , you reduce the capital available to the world 's largest oil company to invest in more exploratory drilling , new oil wells , new pipelines , new refineries , etc.
( 2 ) If you tax oil industry profits , you also reduce the incentive for owners of outside capital to invest in new capacity .
Why bother if the profits will be taxed away ?
Here in Virginia , a semblance of sanity still reigns .
Gov. Timothy M. Kaine has not yet proposed anything as breath - takingly stupid as the proposals emanating from Washington , D.C. .
The Governor has said he will investigate reports of `` price gouging , '' which , given the fact that the the concept of `` price gouging '' is meaningless and impossible to define , means he will , for all practical purposes , do nothing ....
Which is exactly what he should do .
Nothing .
Virginians and Americans will adapt to higher gas prices if government does not interfere .
( The Governor also is considering applying for a waiver of federal regulations requiring cleaner gasoline be sold in Virginia 's major metro areas , but has not yet made a determination .
See the Times - Dispatch report .
Unfortunately , he 's sticking to his guns on trying to raise $ 1 billion for transportation projects without raising gasoline taxes -- a topic for another post .
As I have been hammering away relentlessly on this blog ( See `` A World with One Billion Cars '' ) , the world economy is moving from a 20 - year era of cheap petroleum to a plateau of more expensive petroleum .
This shift is driven by the combination of ( a ) escalating world consumption of petroleum , especially in rapidly developing economies like China and India , and ( b ) the peaking of global oil production capacity , the increasing expense of exploiting the remote and isolated oil reserves that remain , and terrorist / political instability in oil - producing countries .
This is not the oil companies ' fault .
This is not Dick Cheney 's fault .
This is not the auto industries ' fault .
It is not the environmentalists ' fault .
It 's the reality of geology and geopolitics .
The American public can adapt to the new global realities by changing their energy - intensive lifestyles ,
and politicians can help them by speaking honestly and forthrightly about why the price of gasoline is increasing , instead of demagoguing the issue for short - term political gain .
Here in Virginia , the General Assembly has been examining what Virginia can do to increase energy production .
That is OK , as far as it goes .
But there is nothing that Virginia can do to increase the global supply of oil , and probably little it can do to increase the petroleum refining capacity needed to convert oil to gasoline .
What the political and business leadership of Virginia has so far failed utterly to do is admit that Virginia is acutely vulnerable to oil price shocks .
Virginians consume more gasoline per capita than the national average , in part because our transportation policy is geared toward matching every increase in automobile travel with an increase in transportation capacity with no thought of modulating travel demand .
But reality is a stubborn thing .
With each increase in the price of gasoline , the bankruptcy of the old order becomes increasingly evident .
Let us hope that Gov. Kaine , who prides himself on straight talk , begins leveling with the people of Virginia .
Jim - You are right on the money about how capitalism works ,
so why not try to make capitalism really work for Virginia .
The future in transportation belongs to the nation , company or person who develops the alternative to gasoline powered automobiles .
Why not do everything we can to assure that future arises from Virginia ?
Rather than drilling for oil and gas off the Atlantic Coast , we should be offering enormous incentives for comapnies and individuals who want to work on alternative fuel solutions to locate their business here .
You can encourage R&D on alternative fuels with grants and tax breaks .
AND , you can work to increase supply .
The one and only oil refinery in the Commonwealth is nearby in Yorktown .
They could double their capacity without leaving the premises .
Why has n't the company applied to do builf new facilities on site ?
By all means explore for oil and gas in the Atlantic .
Jim : Speaking seriously here , many families ( including my own ) have already cut back in every way possible .
What then ?
My office , home and children 's schools are all within a 6 mile radius .
Vacations are already a thing of the past .
We 've cut back on groceries .
I 'd trade the car on a hybrid ,
but it 's paid for
and who can afford a car payment what with mortgage rates being what they are and three kids ...
So , I ask seriously , what are average hard - working families to do ?
Andrea : How about a couple of hundred dollars ?
If the GA repealed the unnecessary sales tax from last year , then the average citizen would pick up some cash .
Or , the GA could actually cut the sales tax
and you would keep some more of your money .
Check out how much the Republican Senators want you to pay in other , new taxes too - to register your car , etc.
Jim : I like the graphic ,
it takes two arms and two legs to fill up our tank .
The only answer to cutting the cost of mobility and access is settlement patterns that require less vehicle travel and support more effecient shared - vehicles when one must resort to any vehicle .
That is what an understanding of Jane Jacobs suggested 40 years ago ( not just in `` Life and Death ... but also `` The Economy of ' Cities ' . ''
Let us , honor Ms. Jacobs 's memory with an understanding of the need for Fundamental Change .
EMR
JAB - Got ta love it .
Yup , a couple of hundred dollars is going to save the day !
Jane Jacobs knew the difference between a community and a construction plan .
Was n't one of her main arguments that you can not plan everything , and you should allow communities to be what they are and what they become ?
Did n't she fight Robert Moses because he thought he had too much control over other peoples ' lives ?
Somehow I doubt she would have gotten on board with fundamental change if it involved massive central and regional planning .
Andrea , One option may be telecommuting a couple of days a week .
Other than that , here 's the hard truth :
There 's not much that average , hard - working families can do in the short run to cope with higher gas prices except hope that their paychecks keep pace with inflation .
What you should NOT do is support demagogic political ploys that make problems worse , not better .
In the longer run , you can support more pedestrian friendly , transit - friendly development patterns that give you and your family more transportation options .
You should support development patterns that allow compatible uses ( houses , small office buildings , small retail shops ) to be located close to each rather than scattered all over .
How much money could you save if you could get by with only one car instead of two ?
What would it mean if you lived in a place where your children could walk to school ?
Think outside the box .
Kingfish , I 'm all in favor of alternate fuels .
Converting biomass to ethanol seems to be one that is self - sustaining economically without massive incentives .
I 'd favor government - sponsored research to devise technologies that would make ethanol more competitive ,
but I do n't like the idea of subsidizing specific business enterprises .
Once you give them a subsidy , they never let go , no matter how much the world changes around them .
Witness the mohair subsidies put into place during World War II .
I tend to agree with Jim that markets function best , so long as no one has a finger on the scale .
Many believe that zone pricing , which is generally used by oil companies , is inconsistent with our antitrust laws ( Section 13 of the Robinson - Patman Act ) .
Others disagree .
Does zone pricing constitute a finger on the scale ?
If so , should the GA outlaw zone pricing ?
Toomanytaxes : Zone pricing is the mechanism the oil companies use to make sure that we pay the same price as people in states with higher gas taxes .
Only , we pay the extra few cents per gallon to them rather than into our state transportation accounts .
Considering the wide variety in local and state fuel taxes the near uniformity of the pump price across state lines is ... curious .
I was recently on the webpage for the Energy Information Agency
and their cost of fuel adjusted for inflation chart demonstates that we have been at $ 3 per gallon measured in 2005 dollars before .
It is about the historic peak in real prices ,
but it is hardly unprecedented , and not worth quite the hype or hysteria it is generating .
It is hard to imagine a company or a family that can not improve its efficiency and reduce consumption ,
and that is not a bad outcome at all .
Like you , Jim , I see the bright silver lining .
I seem to be getting more questions whenever I pull up in my hybrid .
One data point .
2 @:@ 53 Why are gas prices often significantly different for the same brand between Prince William and Fairfax Counties and even at different locations within the same county ?
Zone pricing is trying to do much more than reflect different tax rates .
Take a look at the following link : http://www.gasbuddy.com/gb_gastemperaturemap.aspx
Assuming the general accuracy of the data underlying the map ,
differences in do not explain zone pricing .
Look at Arizona , for example .
There are much higher transportation costs in and around the Grand Canyon and much more competition in the Phoenix market .
Yet , Phoenix prices tend to be signficantly higher .
Ditto for taxes .
From what I quickly found on the Internet , total fuel taxes for the following four states are VA ( 37.7 cents ) ; Utah ( 42.5 cents ) ; NC ( 45.6 cents ) and Montana ( 46.2 cents ) .
However , both Montana and Utah have average prices that are significantly lower than either VA or NC .
There 's probably less relationship to costs and zone pricing than the oil companies want the public to believe .
I had a conversation with a friend the other day who owns an SUV
and he is n't worried about the price of gas because he travels less than 10 miles a day ..
yes ..
it 'll cost more ...
so he 'll have to cut back on his gourmet coffee ... two cups rather than three . :-)
seriously - it 's about how far folks choose to drive and how folks define phrases like `` I must and have no choice '' .
It takes a hard knock for folks to take a hard look at things they always assumed could not change .
I predict ... lots of folks will be taking harder looks at whether or not choices are choices or no choice '' is truly no choice .
I know it happened during the gas crisis ...
and as bad as it is now - this is not as bad as then - though if $ 3 a gallon is in the rear view mirror and $ 4 a gallon on the horizon and coming fast ... we might think so ...
.. but I would bet that folks would choose ( there 's that word again ) $ 4 or even $ 5 a gallon rather than waiting in line for 3 hours only to find out the guy in front of you got the last tankful .
America 's love affair with the automobile is about to be revisted though I doubt seriously a divorce is anywhere near ... :-)
sorry .. my attitude is grin and bear it ...
it 's sort of like coffee doubling in price ...
my property accessment going up 300 % ( which it did ) ...
... and today .. I paid $ 68 bucks to fill up my 89 Ford Van .
I got ta talk to Ray Hyde about that Hybrid .... he 's got ..
he said if he had to choose .. he 'd keep his truck ... :-)
Did I really say that ?
That would be a tough `` choice '' .
With the truck I 'd have some chance of making money ,
but I 'd hate to have to drive it if it was n't working .
If you have to drive , the hybrid is a joy .
Dead silent , dirt cheap , reliable , little bit of capital cost detriment , sufficient power .
48 mpg if you drive at 75 @+ like a maniac .
I remember people sniffing at it , saying they would n't do it because the payback on capital was n't there .
I drone on about costs and benefits , but a ) that 's not everything , and b ) sometimes circumstances change .
I 'm going to have to send a letter to the guv'nor .
I have a bunch of vehicles and only use the appropriate one for the task at hand .
I need a portable license plate and insurance , otherwise the current `` tax '' plan is going to kill me .
I sure hope that those of you who think saving open space and farms will chip in and help out on this :
send a letter .
I do n't mind paying what it costs to drive or paying what I owe ,
but this is going to be whacked .
I suspect that overhead costs might have something to do with fuel prices .
That gas station in Fairfax is sitting on expensive land and paying high taxes .
Businesses are `` tax positive '' do n't cha know .
If people really do start making different choices , it 's going to be fun to watch real estate prices .
BTW 13 % more new home sales last year , in spite of higher rates ,
but prices were down 5 k .
Time to demand another reassessment .
Ray Hyde : Taxes are indeed business overhead that affect retail prices .
But I still suggest that zone pricing has more to do with computer software and data - mining than actual costs .

If you 're Arlington County , you create a new vision for the boxy buildings and subterranean passageways in Crystal City that will be emptied by the federal Base Realignment and Closure Commission .
In place of the sterile monoculture that now characterizes the office complex near the Pentagon , members of an advisory task force see a more lively street - level scene with a greater mix of shops , restaurants and offices .
Writes WaPo reporter Annie Gowen :
[ Board of Supervisors Chairman Chris ] Zimmerman and others speaking yesterday said that the vounty sees the empty space as an opportunity to `` reimagine '' and `` brand '' Crystal City as an attractive destination .
Though close to Reagan National Airport and dense with hotels , the area has long been seen as a gloomy 1960 s era enclave of offices connected by underground passages .
But parts of Crystal City have lately seen a rebirth , thanks to an influx of trendy cafes and a new streetscape ....
Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty , which owns 7.4 million of the 11 million square feet of office space in the neighborhood , has spent $ 40 million on improvements to enliven the streets and attract new businesses .
It turned Crystal Drive into a two - way main street and has recruited new shops and chic restaurants such as Jaleo and McCormick & Schmick 's .
Reading between the lines of Gowen 's story , however , there seems to be one big missing piece :
Housing .
Creating a livelier commercial district is a worthy goal .
But creating a balanced community with a mix of housing , offices , shopping and other amenities -- allowing people to live close to where they work and play -- is an even more worthy goal .
As Ed Risse has pointed out , the relocation of 17,000 jobs creates a rare opportunity to create a genuine balanced communities in Northern Virginia .
The problem , I surmise -- it 's not discussed in the story -- is that Arlington is concerned about protecting its tax base , which means replacing the vacated offices with new offices , not housing .
It 's hard to fault Arlington for pursuing its short - term self interest .
But everyone needs to recognize that Arlington 's decision not to pursue a balanced community means that housing will end up somewhere else , presumably in outlying counties .
And employees working in the buffed up Crystal City will wind up commuting long distances and clogging Northern Virginia thoroughfares .

I 'm chained to the old masquerade

Michael Jackson may be another example of a celebrity distraction which , upon examination , reveals more about our society 's mortal condition than a tabloid could imagine .
Almost certainly more than it would dare to describe .
Yesterday , Jackson was ordered to close Neverland for having failed to pay the ranch 's 47 employees their salary or insurance since the end of 2005 .
Unfortunate for the unpaid staff and the abandoned llamas but no surprise .
He 's moved on since his aquittal , like Gary Glitter did after his 1999 conviction , having departed last June for a Bahrain `` vacation '' from which he 's yet to emerge .
( '' For the people working at Bahrain 's malls , the person covered head to toe in a black veil , gloves and glasses appeared to be a rich , doting Saudi mother ....
But why would a woman wear a man 's shoes ?
Why the bodyguards ?
And why did the person 's fluid movements seem so familiar ? '' )
Last week 's real Jackson story ran in the New York Daily News , under the snappy banner `` Creepy dad was root of all clan 's woe , singer sez . ''
The singer was brother Jermaine , and the claims based on the projected outline for his abandoned `` tell - all '' family story .
Reading that Joseph was a nightmare of a father and sexually abusive towards his daughters is not exactly a `` stop the presses '' moment .
What 's new is this :
Jermaine even suggested his father may have set up Michael to be somehow victimized by older men .
He tells how his father would have Michael join in at late - night hotel room meetings with `` important business people , '' and wondered whether `` something happened '' to Michael at those sessions .
He said he sensed something was wrong because Michael would be sick for days after .
`` What was Joseph doing ? '' Jermaine wrote .
This lifts the Jackson family horror show to a whole new order of dysfunction , one that sees parents network with power and trade their children for privilege .
This should be a motif familiar to anyone acquainted with the literature of mind control and ritual abuse survivors : the father and first controller , passing his child - victim up the social ladder of abuse in return for status , protection and reward .
Or maybe not : `` LaToya also described being awakened in the night by Joseph wearing a ' monster mask . ' ''
Perhaps we can take more from this than the suspicion that the Jackson clan had gotten with the program .
Perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre @-@ existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect .
( This is how I tend to think of Ponchatoula 's Hosanna Church . )
Yet we should n't discount the suspicion , either , particularly given some of Michael 's paranormal interests and peculiar associations .
His close friendship with SPECTRA contactee and channeller of the Nine , Uri Geller , for one instance .
( Jackson was Geller 's best man in 2001 when he and his wife renewed his vows , the same year Geller is said to have been reactivated as a psychic spy . )
His entourage including a `` personal magician '' for another .
Even if you wanted to , you will n't be reading Jermaine 's account now .
Like every Jackson sibling who 's tried to break from Joe , he 's climbed down , returned to the fold and scrapped the book , apparently on the strength of Michael 's threats to sue .
Previously , Michael 's given cause for family observers to attribute his grotesque body dysmorphia to a dread of resembling his father .
Yet there they were at Jackson 's trial last year , hand in hand .
But his little picture may be more newsworthy than the news suggests .
good stuff .
having departed last June for a Bahrain `` vacation '' from which he 's yet to emerge .
Actually , there have been reports for the past two days of Jackson back in California .
#NAME ?
Wild wild stuff Jeff !
Disinformation Distraction Dis and Dat ..
Bait and switch sets the agenda .
There is no such thing as an accident .
It 's Saturday morning , and the papers say a moon of Saturn is spewing life - giving water .... then I see the new R.I. post is about the perrenial child Michael Jackson .
This day is named for Saturn ...
" ... it was foretold that one day a mighty son of Saturn would in turn overthrow him ,
and Saturn devoured all of his children when they were born to prevent this ... ''
Apparently Saturn is also intimately connected with Satan , Masonics , and Revelation 13 - you know , the `` number of the beast '' ...
Nevermind -
I need a cup of coffee ...
I looked in vain for the Cheney `` A hunting we will go '' to post this out and paste but ...
And on the subject of cowardice , consider this . In a recent hunting escapade , Dick Cheney accidentally shot one of his hunting comrades .
There may have been negligence involved , but that is up to the local district attorney to decide .
But more importantly , I think , is the nature of the hunt .
These were not wild birds .
The birds were bred in captivity .
They had spent their lives in pens , and then on hunting day , were released for the sole purpose of being killed by Dick Cheney and cohorts for pure sport as they flew into the open sky for their only moments of brief freedom .
The link `` personal majician '' is intrigueing .
From Madsen via Boucher :
Jackson 's stay at the Cedars was arranged through David Kuo , George W. Bush 's White House director of the Office of Faith - based Initiatives .
Kuo also previously worked for the Christian Coalition and Senator John Ashcroft .
There 's also some curious Neverland / Disneyland connections to the `` Mickey Mouse Club '' children who are now stars , including Justin Timberlake ( remember the star on Janet Jackson 's breast ? ) and Brittany Spears , Christina Aguilera ...
The piper walks into the mountain , still followed by the children , and the cave closes again ...
Here is Boucher 's follow up to the `` majician '' link of Jeff 's .
but i thought you might cover chile 's inauguration of its first woman president today instead ...
maybe later as the story develops ?
Jeff Boucher 's piece mentions how victims of sexual abuse often have childlike voices , almost as if their development was ' frozen ' around the time of their abuse .
Jackson seems to be of this type .
Or more perversely , fakes that he is :
`` I was always saying [ to Jackson ] people would n't think I was so crazy if they saw who the hell you really are , that you sit around , and you drink and you curse and you 're [ expletive ] funny and you have a bad mouth , and you do n't have that high voice all the time '' -

Michael Jackson 's False Front ?
`` David Geffen , be gone !
Steven Spielberg , be gone ! ''
The witch doctor cursing Michael Jackson 's enemies and blessing the tarnished King of Pop himself in a voodoo ritual in Switzerland in the summer of 2000 had promised that the 25 people on Jackson 's enemies list ( would soon be dead ) ...
Jackson had ordered his then business adviser , Myung - Ho Lee , a U.S. - educated Korean lawyer based in Seoul , to wire $ 150,000 to a bank in Mali for a voodoo chief named Baba , who then had 42 cows ritually sacrificed for the ceremony .
Jackson had already undergone a blood bath ...
The pop star , who is said to be $ 240 million in debt , had paid six figures for a ritual cleansing using sheep blood to another voodoo doctor and a mysterious Egyptian woman named Samia , who came to him with a letter of greeting from a high - ranking Saudi prince , purportedly Nawaf Bin Abdulaziz Al - Saud , now the chief of intelligence of Saudi Arabia ...

According to that Vanity Fair article , Jacko and Uri Geller met through `` that other fellow devotee of children 's charities Mohamed Fayed , the chairman of Harrods in London , who believes that the C.I.A. and Prince Philip had Princess Diana and his son , Dodi , killed . ''
Anonymous quoted , `` Jackson 's stay at the Cedars was arranged through David Kuo ... ''
Hold on --
the Cedars is the headquarters of the Fellowship Foundation , the creepy Christianoid cult with deep political connections .
Here 's a bit of the original Madsen article that the Michael Jackson quote comes from :
In 1976 , the Fellowship began looking for a permanent headquarters in Arlington .
It set its sights on the estate of George Mason IV , The Cedars , located at 2301 North Uhle Street .
Mason was one of the drafters of the Bill of Rights .
The Fellowship , also known as the International Foundation , bought the property from Charles Piluso .
Although not much is known about Piluso , the Los Angeles Times reported that Howard Hughes , the man with whom Fellowship Senator Ralph Owen Brewster once sparred , also lived there .
According to a senior Pentagon official , the Cedars had been used as a CIA safe house prior to the Fellowship 's purchase of the estate .
The Fellowship paid $ 1.5 million for the Cedars , the money coming from Tom Phillips , the CEO of Raytheon , and Ken Olsen , the CEO of Digital Equipment Corporation .
Sanford McDonnell of McDonnell Douglas Corporation was another deep - pocketed supporter of the Fellowship through Full Gospel Business Men 's Fellowship International , an activity linked to Fellowship core member Pat Robertson .
Suffer the little children , eh ?
If this is what power & wealth does to you , I 'm damn glad I have neither .
You said , `` Perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre @-@ existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect . ''
Could n't agree more .
I think that pedophilia 's relative commonality is what really makes it frightening .
My experience happened when I was 15 .
A friend of mine met this guy who was twice our age & who was more than willing to buy us all the whiskey we could drink .
We were both enamored with Kerouac & Jim Morrison & meeting strange characters & this guy definitely fit the bill .
He was muscle for a Pittsburgh madam named Tex Gill .
She dressed like a man & ran most of the massage parlors in Pgh .
He was into black magick & Crowley & booze & drugs & on & on .
& my buddy passes out .
I continue drinking .
At one point , I glance at this older guy ,
& he is staring at my buddy as a line of drool runs down the cigarette in his mouth & drips on to the floor .
He notices that I 'm kind of staring at him .
He stands up , walks into the bedroom , & comes back with a porno mag .
He drops it on the couch next to me .
As he 's sitting down , he says , `` See anything you like ? ''
& then he shoves his hand hard into my groin .....
.... & I broke his nose with my elbow .
I apologize for continuing my ramble but ... ,
MICHAEL JACKSON
MANCHILD IN A PROMISED LAND
by ROBERT J . LEWIS
He 's such an easy target , Michael Jackson .
He makes even the weirdest of the weird feel normal .
But unlike them , Jackson does n't try to hide the fact that he is easily one of the most screwed up beings on the planet .
Every time he checks in for yet another surgery , he is announcing to the world that he does n't know who he is , where he is going , and that he thoroughly loathes himself - at least the adult version .
And for his remarkable honesty , his most unprivate confessions , he is subjected to one public humiliation after another .
Who among us rock throwers would have the courage to reveal about ourselves what Michael has revealed about himself ?
Next to the towering monument that the unedited Michael Jackson is we are telephone booths ;
next to his singular guilelessness and candor , we are the multitude of the prevaricating and pusillanimous .
Everything Michael has done and said during the past 20 years has been against his own apparent self - interest , beginning with unrelenting surgical assaults on his erstwhile good looks , to hanging his child ( and crotch for that matter ) out to dry , to entering details of his bedroom antics into the public domain .
Like a typical Dostoievksy character , we can not account for the behavior if it were n't for an apparently overriding need to confess and proclaim -- over and against what the outside world wants to believe -- the truth of who we are .
The on - going spectacle of Michael 's increasingly bizarre conduct is his confession to the world that he is one spectacularly psychologically - challenged dude .
Like children who are incapable of dissimulating their basic wants and needs , Michael 's manner of being in the world is uncensored and spontaneous ,
and to such an unsuspected extent I propose he deserves to be considered one of the most authentic beings of this or any other century , and quite properly belongs to that exceptional society of authenticity - questers that would include Saint Augustine , Pascal and Heidegger .
The facts of Michael 's life have been well documented .
We know that by the age of 25 he was on top of the world .
Thriller had sold an unprecedented 50 million copies and Billie Jean had become the musical drug of choice in every corner of the world .
Not only was the song 's momentum and tension brilliantly crafted and fused , Michael 's riveting , counterpoint choreography - which remains unsurpassed -- revolutionized the way we simultaneously look at and listen to music .
Before disbelieving eyes , his torso , head and limbs supplied never - before - seen anatomical rejoinders to the notes -- like a guitarist filling in between the lyrics .
But from here on in , it would be downhill for the genre 's quintessential messenger , for Michael could no longer sustain the ' great lie ' he was living .
The child 's ' tin drum ' was beating ever louder in his head
and he intuitively understood that he was developmentally under - equipped to handle the adult pressures of stardom .
Far more compelling than the promise of even greater fame and fortune was the example of Oskar , from Gunther Grass ' The Tin Drum ( 1959 ) , which tells the story of a boy who refuses to grow up , who , through his drumming , rejects the adult world and the horrors taking place in Nazi Germany .
Like Oskar , Michael had witnessed firsthand the abominations of adult behaviour and refused to sign up .
From his earliest years , Michael Jackson was subjected to both extreme psychological and physical abuse at the hands of his status - obsessed father , who designated Michael as the vessel into which he would mercilessly pour the acid of his unrealized ambitions .
To this single end , Joe Jackson was ruthlessly single - minded .
Michael was terrified of him , whose mere presence could induce nausea .
At the age of 5 , the father yanked the son from his pail and sandbox existence and made him run Hollywood 's grimmest gauntlets .
The little mouse that Michael was suddenly found himself in the rat race and quickly learned to hate it ,
and like Oskar , who found respite in the beating of his tin drum , Michael found solace on stage , performing his music .
But the stage could not provide Michael with immunity against the constant encroachment of the adult world .
Listen to his rapid breathing in especially Off the Wall and Thriller : the staccato - like panting of a stalked animal , the desperate breath of human panic , and his small boy 's voice hiding behind the mesmerizing slash and blur of arms and legs fending off an invisible attack .
From one track to the next , the lyrics are n't so much sung as frantically whispered , the vowels cut short to the quick .
Michael was announcing that he could no longer follow the course Father and Hollywood had staked out for him , that the disparity between his real self and the role he was thrust into had reached unsustainable incommensurability .
Only the child within could save the defenceless adult from the depredations of the adult world ,
and from this point on , Michael would reduce the project of his life to letting the world know the truth of who he was : a confused , fragile , lost soul in search of care and love .
By the time Michael had attained mythic status , he was so far removed and alienated from himself , he would have to shed , over a period of 20 years and still counting , one skin after another before his true self could begin to emerge .
As we might expect from someone so radically self - estranged , the result has been nothing less than a metamorphosis .
Michael 's journey of self - discovery is a work in progress like no other because it increasingly depends on the accommodation of two irreconcilables : the child and adult as one .
More revealing of itself than its favorite target , public opinion has not seen fit to grant Michael the inalienable right to his confused mental state and ' off the wall ' comportment .
If most people subscribe to the notion that black and white are not only skin colors but states of mind , why are we baffled or offended when Michael , who was introduced to the white ways of Hollywood at the age of 5 , tells us that he is n't sure what his true color is ?
Robbed of his childhood , abused by a psychotic father and then prematurely subjected to the adult pressures of the entertainment world , why are we surprised to learn that Michael does n't want to grow up , that he prefers the company and community of children , that he wants to be protected and looked after ?
Every time the androgynous Jackson goes under the knife he is crying out that he does n't know if he is man or woman , child or adult , black or white .
As if we would have done otherwise in his situation ?
And to the never - ending suspicion that Michael is a child abuser , what crime has been committed when two experimenting 11 - year - olds fool around sexually ?
If you believe that Michael has the mentality of an 11 - year - old , ( and there has n't been much evidence to the contrary during the past 20 years ) he should not have had to defend himself against accusations of child molestation .
Was it in defense of perversity or his incorrigible innocence that convinced him that it was OK to reveal that he shared his bed with children ?
More questionable , even criminal , than Michael 's alleged fooling around with other kids , were the parents who allowed , even encouraged their children to sleep over and perhaps share the same bed with someone whose sexual predilections have been suspect since 1991 .
On June 13 , 2005 , the courts found Michael not guilty of the charges brought against him .
However , those whose minds were decided on his guilt before the trial began will not be changed by the verdict , just as Michael 's essential nature will not have changed .
Mahatma Gandhi writes that ' There is a higher court than courts of justice and that is the court of conscience . '
Only Michael knows if he is sexually attracted to children , and beyond that , if he has ever acted on those feelings .
And if we grant him the mental age of an 11 - year - old , who has nonetheless conventionally fathered two children , Michael is then a child trapped in an adult body .
Which means the crowning act in his quest for authenticity awaits one final operation .
What does a man do when he feels , acts and responds like a woman trapped in a man 's body ?
He undergoes sexual reassignment surgery and hormone therapy in order to become who ' she ' is .
There remains one final procedure that will totally liberate the child that Michael is .
When Michael finds the courage to act on what his duty toward other children demands -- submit to voluntary neutering -- which will be tantamount to his final confession , the saving grace and glory that is his Neverland will become his forever land .
Tennessee Williams has said for all time , `` there 's not enough kindness in the world . ''
And I say this to you , Michael Jackson , may your tribe increase .
`` Thank God I 'm an atheist : ''
The surrealistic cinema of Luis Bunuel --
by Bryan M. Papciak
`` The thought of death has been familiar to me for a long time , '' says Director Luis Bunuel .
`` From the time that skeletons were carried through the streets of Calanda during the Holy Week procession , death has been an integral part of my life .
I 've never wished to forget or deny it ,
but there 's not much to say about it when you 're an atheist '' ( 255 ) .
So reads an accurate testimonial to the personal and artistic sentiment of this odd and serious filmmaker .
Like many of his contemporary surrealists , Bunuel is a paradox who on one hand claims apathy towards ultimate end , being , and Being , yet on the other hand loads his impressive body of work with moribund imagery and strange ideas about the God he so vociferously denies .
Bunuel exhibits a radical , iconoclastic view of the world in which he finds society decadent and antithetical to human liberation .
He has been called a realist , a surrealist , a Marxist , an anarchist , a mystic , an anticleric , a Freudian , a post @-@ Freudian , a sadist , a moralist , a Christian , and a poet - showman of the macabre .
His scenarios range from the absurd to the tragic to the satiric to the erotic , profusely endued with the outrageous and the scandalous .
Luis Bunuel has long been recognized in European critical circles as a great and prolific filmmaker on a par with Eisenstein , Chaplin , and Fellini .
However , only recently has his reputation in America begun to catch up .
Over his fifty - year career he directed thirty - two feature films and worked in Spain , France , Mexico , Italy , and the United States .
Utilizing sardonic humor and the imagery of surrealism , Bunuel set out to undermine the values and institutions people take for granted .
His aims were specific : through the surreal , visualizing the impulses of the uncon - scious , he would , he said , `` shatter the optimism of the bourgeoisie world and force the reader ( or spectator ) to question the permanency of the prevailing order '' ( Mellen 3 ) .
Luis Bunuel was born February 22 , 1900 in Calanda , a small town in the province of Teruel , Spain .
As a youth he received a Jesuit education , displaying exceptional talent in music , athletics , and the natural sciences .
He enjoyed a comfortable upbringing in a reasonably wealthy , close - knit family .
His family came from liberal , semi @-@ intellectual , land - owning bourgeoisie .
These details are not irrelevant .
To comprehend Bunuel 's works it is essential to understand that he was first a Spaniard and secondly a product of Spanish bourgeoisie .
Virginia Higgenbotham points out that `` blasphemy is only a form of thinking for any intelligent Spaniard , '' and also that the `` art of his country is rich in eroticism and profoundly preoccupied with death '' ( 18 , 20 ) .
Bunuel says : My infancy slipped by in an almost medieval atmosphere ( like that of nearly all the Spanish provinces ) between my native town and Zaragova .
I feel it necessary to say here ( since it explains in part the trend of the modest work which I later accomplished ) that the two basic sentiments of my childhood which stayed with me well into adolescence , are those of a profound eroticism , at first sublimated in a great religious faith , and a permanent consciousness of death .
It would take too long here to analyze the reasons .
It suffices that I was not an exception among my compatriots , since this is a very Spanish characteristic , and our art , exponent of the Spanish spirit , was impregnated with these two sentiments .
The last civil war , peculiar and ferocious as no other exposed them clearly .
Coming of age , Bunuel expressed a strong urge to go to Paris to study music but was sent instead to Madrid to study agricultural engineering .
After a few years , he switched his studies to entomology , and , more importantly , began forming close friendships with a group of young artists who were to influence him strongly in the future .
These companions included the poets Frederico Garcia Lorca and Jose Moreno Villa and the painter Salvador Dali .
In the Madrid residencia Bunuel developed his interest in the arts , theater , and acting and gained his introduction to surrealism .
After graduating in 1925 with a degree in Philosophy and Letters , Bunuel moved to Paris , joined by a few members of his residencia coterie .
Bunuel arrived in Paris highly recommended by influential friends of his parents and was introduced into the best intellectual circles of the city .
He was soon hired as an Assistant Director to Jean Epstien , `` the only director of that bleak era of the French cinema to merit the title of an intellectual filmmaker '' ( Aranda 32 ) .
While honing his skills working as an A.D. , Bunuel also began contributing articles to various literary cinema periodicals , most notably La Gaceta Hispanoamericana .
In 1929 he formally entered the Paris Surrealist Group .
Within this setting he embarked on his first film project as director , a collaboration with his residencia friend Salvador Dali , entitled Un Chien Andalou .
He collaborated with Dali again in 1930 on another surrealist film , L_Age d' Or .
The rest , as they say , is history .
Some critics , most notably Pauline Kael and Penelope Gilliatt , now regard Bunuel as the Hitchcock of surrealism -- a venerated master in total command of his medium and for whom the art of filmic manipulation became a `` delightful form of play . ''
For Bunuel , however , play had little to do with it .
Rather , he saw surrealism as a revolutionary , poetic , and moral movement :
All of us were supporters of a certain concept of revolution , and although the surrealists did n't consider themselves terrorists , they were constantly fighting a society they despised .
The principle weapon was not guns , of course , it was scandal .
Scandal was a potent agent of revelation , capable of exposing such social crimes as exploitation of one man by another , colonialist imperialism , religious tyranny -- in sum , all the secret and odious underpinnings of a system that had to be destroyed .
He went on to say , `` The purpose of surrealism was not to create a new literary , artistic , or even philosophical movement , but to explode the social order , to transform life itself ' ( 107 ) .
Salvador Dali recalled the surrealists ' ideology , `` It is possible to systematize confusion thanks to a paranoia and active process of thought and so assist in discrediting completely the world of reality '' ( Gould 37 ) .
Indeed , the intent of surreal art is to move one from the conscious mind into the subconscious .
It seeks to affect the emotions through the mind .
Michael Gould states in Surrealism and the Cinema , `` If the vision revealed is too much for the rational mind to absorb ( too intense , too threatening , too ' real ' ) yet can not be rejected , then it leaves the consciousness and comes to exist on a sublime level as pure surrealism '' ( 13 ) .
In Un Chien Andalou , for example , a girl 's eye is sliced with a razor blade ,
a man wipes his mouth completely off his face ,
dead donkey carcasses adorn a piano ,
a man 's hand crawls with ants .
Each of these images is clearly too intense for rational thought .
Bunuel was drawn to the surrealist movement for more than revolutionary or psychological reasons .
The moral aspects of the movement intrigued him as well :
For the first time in my life , I 'd come into contact with a coherent moral system that , as far as I could tell , had no flaws .
It was an aggressive morality based on the complete rejection of all existing values .
We had other criteria :
we exalted passion , mystification , black humor , the insult , and the call of the abyss .
Inside this new territory , all our thoughts and actions seemed justifiable ;
there was simply no room for doubt .
Everything made sense .
Our morality may have been more demanding and more dangerous than the prevailing order , but it was also stronger , richer , more coherent .
The surreal qualities in Bunuel 's films can be traced to a number of sources ,
but the primary impetus was his `` irrational sensibility '' as evidenced by his treatment of image , montage , and sound .
These gave his films their dreamlike quality .
His most intense images are evocative of either humor or mystery .
Mystery , he believed , is the essential element of any art ;
it is inseparable from chance ,
and the whole universe is a mystery ,
Bunuel believed that his own form of atheism led inevitably to the acceptance of the inexplicable .
`` Since I reject the idea of a divine watchmaker , '' he said , `` ( a notion even more mysterious than the mystery it supposedly explains ) , then I must consent to live in a kind of shadowy confusion ....
At least it keeps my moral freedom intact '' ( 174 ) .
Predictably , adherence to fantasy as opposed to reason in a rationalistic society leads to conflict .
The surrealists opposed nearly all traditional values and , as noted before , sought to destroy `` all conventional social , moral , and artistic habits of thought and perception '' ( Higgenbotham 30 ) .
Enter Un Chien Andalou .
In 1929 , Un Chien Andalou was as shocking and scandalous as Bunuel and Dali had hoped it would be .
It gave rise to a staggering range of interpretations : poetic , scandalous , incoherent , an attack upon critics , an attack upon religion , and attack upon the bourgeoisie .
( Interestingly , the film was financed by Bunuel 's bourgeois mother . )
Un Chien Andalou ( which means An Andalusian Dog -- though there are no dogs in the film ) was deliberately intended to jolt the spectator 's peace of mind and to convey some of the basic beliefs underlying the surrealist movement , including the omnipotence of desire .
Bunuel stated that he and Dali held to only one rule during the production ,
`` No idea or image that might lend itself to rational explanation of any kind would be accepted .
We had to open all doors to the irrational and keep only those images that surprised us without trying to explain why '' ( 104 ) .
The aim of the film was not exclusively to shock , but to incendiarially affect the collective conscience .
At the same time it was an indictment of all the art consumers who , either through stupidity , masochism , or self interest , were willing to swallow anything , no matter how much it went against their instincts .
Bunuel asked , `` What can I do about the people who adore all that is new , even when it goes against their deepest convictions , or about the insincere , corrupt press and the inane herd that saw beauty and poetry in something which was basically no more than a desperate call for murder ? '' ( Bauche 9 ) .
The film is a dream and , like a dream , is both fascinating and disturbing .
The opening scene in which a girl 's eye is sliced sets the tone of the film 's meandering and confusing itinerary .
Many of the elements that make up the film are remnants of objective reality .
The way they are arranged within the scenario pushes them into a mental reconstruction process -- in exactly the way dreams draw on the previous day 's experience .
Interestingly , the images have the matter - of - fact quality of a newsreel , or what Higgenbotham calls a `` prosaic realism '' ( 38 ) .
Bunuel chose not to use the distorted lenses , supered images , or blurred focus ( cinematic conventions of the day ) to suggest the dreamlike quality of his film .
Instead , he approached the entire non @-@ narrative in a straightforward manner .
He used the shocking incongruity of the images themselves to build the hallucinatory feeling of anguish that runs through the film .
The unrealistic fashion in which the realistic images were juxtaposed was the perfect way , according to Freddy Bauche , to illustrate `` the dramatic collision between desire and the object of desire '' ( 10 ) .
Obviously , the director drew much of Un Chien Andalou from his Spanish heritage -- the religious and social implications , the themes of emotionalism and death , even the donkey carcasses .
`` Thus Un Chien Andalou , as a milestone in the history of cinema , emerges from its director 's adolescence in Spain and announces the themes and techniques that were to preoccupy Bunuel for half a century , through the rest of his career '' ( Higgenbotham 39 ) .
Where desire and eroticism prevailed in Un Chien Andalou , religion took center stage in Simon del Desierto ( Simon of the Desert ) , produced in Mexico in 1965 .
Simon del Desierto is a bizarre little narrative set in the fifth century A.D.
Saint Simon , in order to be as close to God as possible , has stood praying on top of a sixty - foot pillar for thirty - seven years .
He is profoundly sanctimonious - to the degree that he even blesses his own tooth when it falls from his mouth .
His devotion , however , is put to the test when the Devil ( a woman wearing the uniform of a Catholic school girl ) arrives in a slithering coffin at the pillar .
She is intent on luring the Holy Disciple from his perch as she repeatedly ridicules him and insults his character .
Simon heroically resists her temptations at every turn despite her various disguises ; first , a priest , then a shepherd , and finally as the Savior himself .
At last , despite Simon 's holy strength , and for reasons not entirely clear , the Devil is able to exert her full power and whisk him away to hell -- a Greenwich village disco where trendies writhe and grind to `` The Radioactive Flesh . ''
The implications are staggering .
`` The saint , devoted to his god , sits high on a pillar for all of life ....
But the pillar , discolored over the years , winding and twisting its way to the ground , is the excrement of the saint .
Saint though he is , his bowels must still move .
So there he sits , near God indeed , but supported on a pillar of excrement '' ( Mellen 115 ) .
There have been several interpretations of this seemingly blasphemous imagery .
One is that God and his church are really built on unacknowledged humanity .
Another is that we can reach God only through understanding the true nature of our humanity .
Still another is that religion ( primarily Catholicism ) is essentially a `` pillar of excrement . ''
Bunuel himself put all the interpretations in perspective when he said , `` Thank God I 'm still an atheist . ''
Luis Bunuel 's flair for perverse surrealism and his malicious attacks on conventional morality were fully realized in his second to last film , Le Fantome de la Liberte ( The Phantom of Liberty ) , produced in France in 1974 -- almost fifty years after Un Chien Andalou .
Fantome in many ways functioned as a sort of sequel to his 1972 film , Le Channe Discret de la Bourgeoisie ( The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie ) .
The images are astounding and playfully absurd :
Spanish hostages of the Napoleonic war cry `` Down with Freedom ! '' as they are executed .
A French lieutenant fondles the statue of a beautiful noblewoman and is struck on the head by another statue .
Bourgeois couples discuss defecation around a toilet - lined table but consider `` food '' an impolite topic , and so on .
The titular reference to a `` phantom '' boffows from the opening line of Karl Marx 's Communist Manifesto :
`` A specter is haunting Europe - the specter of communism . ''
Bunuel twists this meaning to imply that the specter haunting the bourgeoisie is `` the possibility of its own freedom unburdened by the dead ends of sexual license , willful irrationality , and the liberty to go beyond the self - indulgent eccentricities of the individual ego '' ( Mellen 318 ) .
Bunuel compared the film to one of his earlier surrealist works , L_Age d' Or , saying , `` It is no longer possible to scandal @-@ ize people as we did in 1930 .
Today you have to do it with sweet subversion '' ( Mellen 183 ) .
Le Fantome de la Liberte charges that society has substituted arbitrary willfulness for freedom .
One of the film 's vignettes shows two parents who insist on declaring their daughter a missing person , although she is plainly sitting in front of them .
The police , in a similar display of willful blindness to reality , even ask the child herself for her vital statistics and how she disappeared .
In another episode , four chain - smoking monks gamble with their holy medallions in a card game .
`` I 'll open with a virgin , '' says one .
Another plays a `` father . ''
Bunuel believed reality is actually a smoke screen for hidden urges .
He used the absurd to imply `` an attack on specific abuses , not on some safely vague condition of man '' ( Durgnat 65 ) .
In Le Fantome de la Liberte Bunuel doubts not so much the possibility for society 's redemption as its likelihood .
`` We have been rendered unwittingly comfortable within our psychic cages to the point where we prefer them to liberty , an experience and aspiration we neither understand or desire '' ( Mellen 331 ) .
For fifty years , Luis Bunuel made films about society 's dilemmas .
His art is his declaration of confidence in a human race dominated by a bourgeoisie given to hypocrisy , sadism , and above all , a disrespect for its own capacity to live differently and better .
He summed it all up himself :
As I drift toward my last sigh , I often imagine a final joke .
I convoke around my deathbed my friends who are confirmed atheists as I am .
Then a priest , whom I have summoned , arrives ;
and to the horror of my friends , I make my confession , ask for absolution for my sins , and receive extreme unction .
After which I turn over on my side and expire .
But will I have the strength to joke at that moment ?
Luis Bunuel died in 1983 .
Note : There 's a piece by George Packer in The New Yorker ( '' Betrayed : the Iraqis who trusted America the most '' ) about all this , but it 's way too long to blog here .
Check it out if you want .
It 's hair - raising stuff .
Christ , can no one trust an American anymore ?
I 'm gettting sick and tired of being ashamed of the USA .
What have we come to ?
Fuck , piss , shit .
Anyway , here 's a shorter piece from Mother Jones :
Thrown to the Assassins
They cheered the U.S. invasion ;
they offered to help , signed on as translators , risked everything they had to work for the United States .
But when they had to run for their lives , America slammed the door .
By David Case / Mother Jones
On the day the American tanks rolled into Baghdad , Abather Abdul Hussein and his wife , Balqes Abdel Mohammed , threw flowers .
Literally .
After a lifetime of turmoil and tyranny , the couple fervently believed the invasion would bring peace .
Abather joined U.S. `` democratization '' efforts , such as a project to create a governing council for his neighborhood , and he occasionally ended up in the good - news Iraq stories that still seemed plausible in those days ;
one U.S. paper ran a five - column photo of him perched on a classroom chair surrounded by American soldiers , with a story about the `` new Iraq . ''
These days , Abather and his young family are among the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who have fled in fear for their lives .
After months spent dodging insurgents who had targeted them for supporting the Americans , he and Balqes are relieved to have escaped -- and bitter , like thousands of fellow refugees , that the superpower for which they risked their lives has abandoned them .
A short man who bundles his shattered body in layers against the desert 's winter chill , the 34 - year - old Abather is polite and relaxed , with an easy smile .
An engaging conversationalist even in broken English , he loves to talk about Baghdad , his infant daughter , and his wife , an outspoken woman several years his senior , whom he calls a genius .
`` When we met she was a professor at Baghdad University , '' he boasts .
`` I was her student .
When she walked into a room , hundreds of people would stand to pay her respect . ''
Considering that his life savings will run out in two months , that he can n't work legally in Jordan , and that he could be deported at any moment , Abather is remarkably stoic , though the anxiety leaks out in tics .
He chain - smokes cheap Craven A cigarettes , crushing the charred filters in an overflowing ashtray ;
when Balqes complains , he sheepishly offers that `` smoking is my only work . ''
It 's not quite true --
his one other job during the past 18 months has been recounting his nightmare , over and over again , to border guards , embassy workers , and aid agencies .
In December , he reluctantly told it to me , pulling documents from a worn leather folder to corroborate the details .
The story began after the ouster of Saddam , when Abather and Balqes , like many Iraqis , launched a de @-@ Baathification program of their own .
Their target was the dean who had been Balqes ' boss at Baghdad University ( and who , as Abather tells it , had forced her out when she resisted joining the Baath Party ) .
Balqes wanted her job back ;
one day Abather confronted the dean ,
and tempers flared .
American soldiers broke up the brawl , bound Abather 's wrists with a zip tie , and interrogated him .
He explained Balqes ' gripe and what the loss of her job had meant for their family , including their 3 - year - old son and Balqes ' 14 - year - old son from a previous marriage ( her first husband had been killed in the Iran - Iraq War ) .
Though he held a master 's degree in engineering , Abather had n't been able to get a job in the doldrums of sanctions - era Iraq ,
so he was scraping together a living repairing watches , his wife and children crammed into his father 's small home .
`` The soldiers were very understanding , '' Abather recalls .
`` I was impressed . ''
They offered the family an apartment in a place called Iraqi Village , a compound near the Baghdad airport where Saddam had housed orphans he was grooming to become fedayeen loyalists .
In return , the couple translated for the Americans , and eventually the Washington National Guard 's 1 st Battalion 303 rd Armored Regiment hired Balqes as an interpreter , at $ 15 per day .
Abather ended up leading a U.S. Army - contracted security squad with a monthly salary of $ 130 .
Learning that he was an engineer , soldiers later gave him lucrative reconstruction assignments .
He started an engineering firm and worked with contractors such as ABB and Kellogg , Brown and Root ;
in one heady year , Abather 's contracts would mushroom from a few thousand dollars to an $ 862,000 electrification project ( later canceled because he could n't procure the needed equipment ) .
Abather and Balqes glow with wonder when they speak of those days , of earning a good living and having their own home for the first time .
Most of all , Abather enjoyed hanging out with the Americans .
He seems to remember every soldier he ever met :
Captain Philips and Sergeant Buchard gave his children toys , a soccer ball , and school stationery ;
Lieutenant Glenn Allen got so close to the family they called him `` Uncle Allen . ''
( Allen confirmed Abather 's story in emails to me , calling him and Balqes `` very helpful individuals '' who `` risked their lives by meeting with us . '' )
It was as if they had suddenly found themselves citizens of the 51 st state .
And so , in October 2004 , when Abather got his first death threat , he thought it was a joke .
It was handwritten , tucked under the windshield wiper of his car inside Iraqi Village , a gated community with American checkpoints at both its entrances ;
The note read :
Abather , Leave your work with the Americans .
Otherwise you will be killed by jihadis because you are a traitor .
Jihad Army
Then the killings began .
Lieutenant Allen had once given Abather a photo depicting two American soldiers with five of their Iraqi friends .
Three of the Iraqis were assassinated in short order .
Abather began to notice cars following him ,
and a few times shots were fired at his car .
The anonymous notes grew increasingly menacing .
Eventually , Iraqi Village felt so dangerous that Abather and Balqes moved the family back to his father 's house .
A death threat arrived there almost immediately .
Still Abather continued working with the Americans .
One day in August 2005 , Abather was driving Balqes , six months pregnant with their second child , to a doctor 's appointment .
At an intersection , he noticed a gold car parked by the road ;
suddenly the two men in it leveled guns at him .
`` This is the end , '' Abather thought ,
and then a U.S. patrol appeared
and the assailants vanished into traffic .
Within days , Abather and Balqes had sold off their belongings and fled to Amman .
Their troubles had only just begun .
The U.S. Embassy in Amman is an attractive , Arabian - style fortress , heavily guarded machine - gunners in Ford pickups .
It sits high on a hillside ,
and the view is so phenomenal that you can imagine your gaze reaching all the way to the Iraqi border , some 200 miles away .
In the foreground , Amman 's rolling mosaic of pale , boxy limestone buildings shimmers against the azure sky .
At its edges , in dank apartments on outlying hillsides , lives a substantial portion of Baghdad 's educated middle class .
Almost all fled in a panic , after getting death threats or seeing loved ones murdered ;
many were targeted by insurgents or jihadis because they supported , or worked for , the Americans .
Of Iraq 's 27 million prewar population , about 1 in 8 -- some 3.4 million people -- have left their homes since the invasion , according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees ( unhcr ) ,
and more than half of those have ended up abroad .
Refugees International labels this the world 's fastest - growing humanitarian crisis .
Yet the Bush administration has refused to so much as acknowledge the refugees ' plight , let alone help them get to safety or even provide basic humanitarian aid .
In the past , notes Bill Frelick , refugee policy director at Human Rights Watch , the United States has often aided those persecuted for supporting it ;
since the Vietnam War , 1 million Vietnamese refugees have been resettled in the United States , including tens of thousands of South Vietnamese army veterans .
But the Bush administration `` has abdicated that obligation , '' says Frelick .
`` The people who have fled are the ones the administration was relying on to build democracy in Iraq ;
it would rather ignore them than acknowledge that its initiative has failed . ''
It was in Jordan that Abather and Balqes discovered the limitations of their friendship with the United States .
Lieutenant `` Uncle '' Allen had emailed the embassy in Amman to explain that the family feared for their lives ;
he 'd even offered to sponsor their relocation `` to the safety of the United States . ''
An unsigned email from the embassy commended Allen -- '' I know that your Iraqi friends appreciate your friendship '' -- but noted that U.S. visas are `` quite difficult '' for Iraqis to get .
Since 9 / 11 , Middle Easterners in general , and Iraqis in particular , have faced enormous hurdles getting admitted to the United States ;
until 2005 , the Bush administration maintained a total freeze on Iraqis that shut out current refugees as well as hundreds of people who had fled Saddam Hussein 's regime years earlier .
The email nonetheless provided instructions on getting a tourist visa ,
and Abather and Balqes quickly filed their application along with the $ 200 fee -- almost two months ' rent .
Several months later they were notified that they could visit the United States for up to three months , but that they could not bring their children .
They then made repeated visits to the unhcr to apply for official refugee status .
As it has with almost 99 percent of the Iraqis who have come through its office in Amman , the agency turned them down .
Abather and Balqes set their sights on a visa to Australia , a major destination for Iraqi refugees , and even hired an Iraqi lawyer there .
They waited for months .
Their savings dwindled ;
then their baby fell ill ,
and the emergency surgery , for an intestinal obstruction , cost $ 2,100 in cash .
In early June 2006 , Abather got a rejection letter from Australia .
Around the same time , word came that his father had died of a heart attack .
So he went back to Iraq to bury his father , help his mother find a place to live , and buy state - subsidized medicine for his daughter .
But when he returned to the Jordanian border less than a week later , he was told he could n't reenter the country :
Having recently suffered two terrorist attacks , Jordan had enacted a ban on entry for Iraqi men aged 17 to 35 .
For two days Abather stood on the highway at the border post , beseeching successive shifts of immigration officials .
Finally , a guard promised to send the medicine to his family in Amman if he would just go away .
Once again Abather headed back to Baghdad .
Driving in Baghdad a few days later , he noticed a bmw -- the Iraqi gangster 's vehicle of choice -- in his rearview mirror , closing in .
The car forced him off the road ;
armed men blindfolded him and knocked him unconscious .
When he woke up , he was in a tiny room , handcuffed to a chair .
Masked men came and went , videotaping as they cursed him as a traitor .
They whipped him with a steel cable ;
six months later , his back was still etched by deep , evenly spaced grooves .
`` We 've been searching for you for a year , '' his captors told him .
Abather recognized the voice of one man , an acquaintance from Iraqi Village who had seemed to befriend the Americans .
`` I 'm sorry your father passed away , '' the man said .
Soon , a bearded imam sentenced Abather to decapitation for collaborating with the United States .
Abather barely heard the proceedings .
`` I was thinking the whole time about my little daughter in Amman . ''
He was told he could save himself by spying on the Americans , but he refused .
On the eighth day , the men asked if there was anything he wanted before he died ;
then they put him on the floor in the back of the bmw and sped off .
Suddenly , Abather heard gunshots .
The men shouted .
The car crashed ,
and everything went black .
He woke up in a hospital bed 60 miles from Baghdad ;
Iraqi forces had attacked the bmw and pulled him from the burning wreck .
He had a compound fracture in his leg and severe burns all over his body ,
but the nurses urged him to leave :
His captors would be looking for him .
His brother -- who had received a ransom note from the kidnappers , complete with a photo of Abather bound and gagged -- brought him back to Baghdad , where doctors fused a piece of plastic onto his shin and grafted skin from his thighs over his wounds .
A few weeks later , he was back at the Jordanian border ,
and this time the guards took pity .
The family had n't told Balqes of the kidnapping .
But when she saw her disfigured husband , she says , `` I knew right away what happened . ''
On a crisp , clear day this past December , clutching a sheaf of papers documenting Abather and Balqes ' ordeal -- contracts , soldiers ' recommendations , death threats , a missing - person report -- I headed to American Citizen Services at the U.S. Embassy in Amman .
Abather and Balqes had made several pilgrimages there ;
they were convinced that if only they could speak to an American , Abather 's charred and mangled flesh would make their case , but they had never gotten past the Jordanian security guards .
Outside the embassy , I joined a chatty , eclectic crowd of Americans : a retired hippie turned English teacher from Vermont ; a woman with a New York accent who struggled through the narrow eye - slit in her black veil to keep track of her hyperactive daughter ; a white - bearded man in a Santa hat , who said he was picking up his passport before returning to the North Pole .
I wondered whether any of us would risk our lives for the United States as Abather and Balqes had .
To get past the compound 's first wall , we navigated a metal detector , a body frisk , and an X-ray machine ;
after crossing a 30 - foot no man 's land we repeated the process at the second wall .
Then we waited to be called .
The United States admits more refugees than any country in the world ,
but in 2006 , only 202 Iraqis were allowed in ,
and most of them had fled persecution under Saddam before the war .
This year , millions of Iraqis , Tibetans , Sri Lankans , and Afghans must compete for a mere 5,500 refugee slots Congress has allocated for the Middle East and South Asia .
The Iraqis are in line behind their compatriots who have been waiting in Jordan since the late 1990 s .
Like other Western representatives , U.S. officials here refer displaced people to the unhcr , which is charged with determining whether someone is a real refugee , and if so , with finding him a safe place to go .
Except that , as Amman unhcr head Robert Breen told me , a 1998 agreement with Jordan forbids the agency from classifying anyone as a refugee whom it can n't get out of the country within six months -- an impossibility in the post / 11 world .
( A country of about 6 million , Jordan has long had the world 's highest refugee population per capita , hosting more than a million Palestinians who fled Israel in 1948 and were supposed to stay only a short time . )
Of the 21,000 Iraqi asylum seekers the office has registered since the U.S. invasion , only 291 have been granted refugee status ; meanwhile the line outside the unhcr 's gates gets longer every week ,
and the wait for an interview stands at five months .
To care for all of the region 's displaced Iraqis , the agency had a total budget of $ 22 million in 2006 -- less than $ 7 a person , which must cover not only the Kafkaesque registration programs but also basic survival aid to refugees trapped in desert camps or squatting in abandoned buildings .
Recognizing the potential for `` severe humanitarian suffering , '' the Iraq Study Group in December recommended that `` the United States take the lead '' in funding the UNHCR 's Iraq program ;
currently it donates no more than a quarter of the budget .
Direct U.S. aid to the refugees consists of a tiny grant to the Catholic relief organization Caritas ( see `` How to Help , '' page 68 ) .
At the embassy , I recounted Abather and Balqes ' ordeal at Window 3 , then at Window 1 -- the setup was similar to visitation in a high - security prison .
Then , at Window 4 , I told the story again to the consul general , who stood behind the bulletproof glass wearing a telephone headset .
I was expecting to hear that `` the United States is doing its best to help , ''
but there was only silence as the consul 's eyes welled up .
( An Amman - based aid worker later told me that American diplomats are so distraught by the policies they are charged with representing that `` it just takes a few gin and tonics and they 'll break down . '' )
Finally , the consul said , `` We hear stories like this all the time .
We have enormous empathy for the Iraqis who 've suffered after working with the Americans ,
but there 's really nothing the embassy can do for them . ''
She handed me a document outlining Congress ' sole concession to people like Abather and Balqes : visas for up to 50 military translators from Iraq or Afghanistan each year .
`` But do n't get their hopes up , '' she added quickly ;
there were thousands with the same story .
`` This is something Congress really needs to address , '' she said as we parted .
The administration certainly does n't seem inclined to take the initiative .
Philip A. Frayne , an embassy spokesman in Amman , told me that `` there are no reliable figures '' on how many people have fled Iraq , and that in any case , it was Saddam who drove out `` a large percentage '' of them .
Likewise , in its 2006 annual refugee report to Congress , the State Department focused mainly on those Saddam - era exiles , and blithely intoned , `` It is hoped that significant numbers of Iraqi refugees will soon be able to return home , although the security situation will remain an important consideration . ''
The report ignored the fact that , according to a survey by the nonprofit U.S. Committee for Refugees , 644,500 new refugees entered Jordan and Syria in 2005 alone .
And 2006 will likely be worse .
As much as a quarter of greater Amman 's population is now Iraqi ,
and the crowds have exacerbated the city 's severe water shortage .
Prices have skyrocketed .
Until recently Iraqi children could n't attend Jordanian schools ,
and their parents can not legally work ;
easily identified by their dialect , Iraqis are discriminated against and terrified of deportation .
Some refugees never go outside .
Jordanian government spokesman Nasser S. Judeh told me that his country , a staunch U.S. ally and aid recipient , `` certainly needs help , and has held discussions with U.S. diplomats '' about this issue .
Incidentally , Human Rights Watch has also called upon the Gulf Arab states to pitch in ;
Saudi Arabia 's response so far has been to plan construction of a 560 - mile wall along its border with Iraq .
Before I left Jordan , Abather invited me to visit his family and a physician friend from Baghdad who shares their two - room basement apartment .
On the Al Zawraa TV channel from Baghdad , we watched U.S. Army vehicles disappear behind roadside bomb blasts as a man sang , `` Let 's go kill the Americans ! ''
The channel 's endless stream of anti @-@ American propaganda perplexed Abather and his friends :
`` Why does the United States allow this ? '' they inquired .
When images of dead children supposedly killed by the Americans hit the screen , Abather 's friend switched to a channel on which voluptuous Arab women danced in an un @-@ Islamic way .
Balqes served Iraqi coffee ,
and to keep the baby from playing with the colorful cups , Abather suspended her from an elastic swing above our heads .
She giggled as he bounced her by her tiny foot .
This is her prison , he joked .
Six months after the kidnapping , he still had n't gotten the surgery he needed to heal his burned flesh ;
if the wounds become infected , he could die .
Abather rarely complained .
God is testing us , he said .
But we will get through it .
He looked at the girl bouncing from the ceiling and smiled .
I have a daughter ,
and I 'm very happy .
Balqes was more fearful -- twice in the past month , suspicious men had shown up at the apartment .
Iraq , she worried , had already caught up with them .
How to Help
Very few organizations are working on getting aid to Iraqi refugees , and of those that are , many are too small or too beleaguered to accept individual donations ;
the Iraqi Red Crescent , for example , has suffered bombings and mass kidnappings , yet its volunteers continue to deliver aid to displaced families inside Iraq .
One of the larger relief organizations working with the refugees is the Catholic group Caritas , whose caseworkers I shadowed while in Amman .
Bucking the image of the Land Rover - driving aid worker , they made their rounds in an aging gray Honda , its roof eaten through by rust .
They visited Iraqi doctors , engineers , and executives desperate for food , heat , or blankets to fend off the desert winter ;
one family told the crew they had just sold their stove to buy food .
Caritas helps a few thousand families a year ,
but the demand far outstrips the money available to us , says Magy Mahrous , who oversees the project .

At first , I signed up for a blog on DONEWS , thinking that it was a site for IT professionals where I could perhaps find friends more easily .
Later , I signed up for another one on MSN , feeling that writing on MSN might make it easier for me to communicate directly with my MSN pals .
But gradually , I discovered that both sites were not very good .
At that time , DONEWS did not have the function of tallying traffic statistics ( I have the habit of looking at the statistics of everything ) ; and even though MSN had that function , others needed to sign on to MSN before they could reply , this meant that after reading the entries , many could not reply even if they wanted to , hence largely reducing the interactive element .
The enthusiasm with writing the blog at the beginning was short - lived ; after writing a few original articles for promotion , I did not continue anymore .
At that time , I did n't think about posting articles from other sites as I felt that there was no need to post any articles if I could not come up with anything original ; this meant that sometimes for over two months I did n't even update a new entry .
Later , there were also some minor problems with both MSN and DONEWS , so I became more unwilling to post new articles .
So , these two blogs have not really been very popular , either
One of the hypotheses states : a long time ago , in order to hide from wild beasts roaming on the land , humans had ever lived in shallow water regions for a long period of time , surviving on aquatic plants and fishes .
Therefore , the body hairs , which increased the friction in water , had fallen off .
The reason for this explanation is that the fine hairs on the back of humans run from one side of the shoulder toward the spine , a different direction from that of monkeys .
Only such a direction could reduce the friction in water , and provide more buoyancy for the person who is swimming in the water .
However , in all the primitive gathering settlements that have been discovered so far , we have not seen any settlement where people lived in such a way .
What is worse is -- from the perspective of the direction of the fine hairs as well -- the fine hairs on humans ' upper arm point downward , while the fine hairs on the lower arm point upward , which is to say , they all run toward the elbow .
This is somewhat similar to monkeys who have hairs : when it rains , they would hold their heads with their hands , and such a direction of their hairs would be easier for the rain to flow away along their elbows
What was Saddam prosecuted for ?
Earlier on , Iran 's involvement with the Euro - for - oil transactions turned out to be a big news item with negligible after - effects , and finally it became a non @-@ issue , and hence there was no problem for Iran and the United States .
But this time , Putin came up with a Ruble - for - oil proposal , and even began intensive preparations .
Nobody would have any doubts about the technical capacity of Russia , not to mention its ability to protect its own resources and trade systems ,
The intimidation that Russia had inflicted on Ukraine is still remembered with a tinge of fear by some European brother - like countries .
The Ruble is allowed to float freely now , but everyone still has sufficient reasons to doubt the replacement of the US dollar in Dollar - for - oil .
But what was more vicious about Comrade Putin was that he had rolled out what is known as a " barbarous " gold system ; and that is , before the wide acceptance of the Ruble - for - oil , a portion of Russia 's annual oil revenues would be channeled toward increasing the country 's holdings of gold .
This is the first among all major countries to have issued such a clear proclamation - no wonder the recent link between gold and oil had almost been severed .
Following the government 's announcement of new immigration regulations , all travelers arriving in New Zealand will receive the same treatment as they would receive when going to the US .
When they enter the country , they will be asked to provide biometric information .
At a press conference this afternoon , new immigration law confirmed by Immigration Minister David Cunliffe will give immigration officials the power to collect , store and use biometric information of non @-@ New Zealand citizens .
These so - called non @-@ New Zealand citizens include people with a tourist , temporary or residency visa .
These new regulations are very similar to procedures for entering the US .
The new immigration law also permits the immigration service to provide " limited " biometric information on New Zealand citizens to neighboring countries .
However , the law does not explain the reason .
Cunliffe said , it has presently not been decided when or how the biometric information will be collected from people 's bodies .
The government has introduced legislation that will permit further collection of DNA samples from people 's bodies .
The new regulation on biometric information is only one article among the sixty - one articles that make up the new regulations .
Cunliffe said the new regulations will effectively simplify border - entry procedures and protect citizens ' right and international human rights .
In New Westminster , a homicide occurred yesterday in an apartment where many Chinese reside ,
A youth in his 20 s was suspected to have been seriously attacked after he left a party ; he was found lying in one of the apartment units , and was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital .
After the event , two men were detained by the police to assist in the investigations , the motive of the murder remains unclear , and the case is now referred to the Provincial Integrated Homicide Investigation Team for further investigations .
According to the spokesman for the Provincial Integrated Homicide Investigation Team , Dale Carr , the crime scene was in an apartment unit on the 800 block of Agnes Street ( Agnes St. ) in New Westminster .
The police received an emergency 911 call at 12 @:@ 20 a.m. yesterday , and rushed to the address mentioned above to investigate .
When the police arrived at the scene , they found an injured man lying in the unit ; he was seriously wounded , and certified dead upon arrival at the hospital .
The body was sent to the coroner for an autopsy in order to determine the cause of death .
For now , the police will not announce the name of the victim ; it will be decided upon only after the family is notified .
As to the cause of the victim 's death , and whether the case is linked to any illegal activities and others and etc. , the police declined comment .
Carr also said that the police had applied for a search warrant from the court yesterday morning , and entered the unit in the afternoon with the warrant for a detailed investigation , in order to understand more about the incident .
Investigators from the Identification Bureau also went to collect information from the scene later ,
As to the motive of the attack , and whether the police had found the weapon , the police have declined disclosure .
In the face of criticism and nitpicking , I believe that Jesus is weaker than Darwin .
Why ?
Because Darwin was allowed to make mistakes , since he was a human being ; but Jesus was not allowed to make mistakes , since he had been described as God .
Darwin proposed Evolution Theory , but it was just a theory , and he himself also admitted that there were many questions ,
Others may agree with him , or they may accept some parts while disagreeing with other parts , or in the future we might discover that the general direction of Darwin 's evolution is largely correct though filled with a lot of errors , and that there might be an improved version of evolution which is more accurate and comprehensive than what Darwin had proposed .
But as the originator , Darwin deserves much credit .
Jesus is God , and the Bible is the word of God .
God creates everything , understands everything , predicts the future , and is infinitely resourceful , so how can he be wrong !
Therefore , if you find a sentence that is allegedly said by God , but effectively turns out to be wrong , then this god will be overthrown .
Therefore , Jesus is more vulnerable to criticism than Darwin , because once an error is found , then he could not be the true god .
After the collapse of Saddam Hussein 's dictatorial regime , Iraqi religious forces had entered a period of revitalization and expansion ,
Although the distribution system of the new legislative power in Iraq had generally taken care of the interests of all parties , and found a relatively reasonable balance point among all ethnic groups and sects -- otherwise a management committee , the interim constitution , and the current interim government would not have been successfully generated -- this does not mean that there were no contradictions among them .
From an internal point of view , Shiites and Kurds tend to see eye to eye on the political and economic benefits , and Iraqi politics had almost become the arena of these two factions ,
Although under the balance of interests some of Sunni political figures were involved in politics , what the Sunni radical groups were most concerned about was that the Shiites would turn around and suppress them in the future .
In February of this year , a radical Sunni organization attacked the Ali Mosque , which is the religious shrine of Shiite Muslims , and this led to the eruption of the conflict between Iraq 's two largest parties .
The assassination of the Lebanese Minister of Industry has triggered off angry protests from supporters , plunging Lebanon into yet another precarious situation .
In merely two short years , this minister is the fifth senior official to be assassinated ; this shows that even after the forced withdrawal of Israeli troops , long - suffering Lebanon still has n't ushered in the peace that it hoped for yet .
The United States claimed that the Syrian government was the murderer , but Syria retorted by saying that the accusation was " totally without foundation , and in disregard of facts . "
At this moment , the real murderer is probably tittering , but the world has clearly seen that any one of the regimes of Lebanese and Iraqi is more fragile than the other .
The Western media said that in the " post @-@ Bush " garbage era , countries like Iraq , Syria , and Lebanon will encounter a lot more good shows or terrible tragedies .
And the people believed that .
It is uncertain whether the Canadian Prime Minister had taken the political equivalent of Viagra , or had lost his mind due to political biases , but he " lost his temper " several times in China during APEC , and almost messed up his meeting with President Hu .
Fortunately President Hu was magnanimous enough not to take it to heart , and gave him the honor of a 15 - minute meeting .
However , when this fellow returned to his own country , he boasted recklessly by saying that his meeting with President Hu had " important historical significance , " and even exaggerated by claiming it as his " major diplomatic achievement . "
But those Canadian opponents already disgruntled with him , seeing through his tricks , could immediately tell that the meetings that President Hu had such as with Bush , Abe , and Putin all lasted over an hour ; a mere 15 - minute meeting with you -- excluding the pleasantries and translations -- was no different from an extended hand - shake .
This early morning the soccer match between the Chinese women 's team and the Korean team had indeed made me excited , I was surprised by the match 's brilliance , and I also gained a new understanding of the Korean team .
They attacked swiftly and fearlessly and coordinated with tacit understanding , but looking back at the Chinese women 's soccer team , it was in an inferior position either in time - control or coordination .
We lost this game with no complaints .
But looking at the match between the Chinese men 's soccer team and the Iranians , that goal -- the insulting , provocative , and perverse goal -- made me question the quality of the Iranian team and even of the people in that country .
The Chinese team showed their guts during this game ; they manifested the courage and fighting spirit of Chinese people .
We did not shy away from the powerful Iranian team , but did our best ; it was n't until after an overtime and two rounds of penalty kicks that we then regretfully lost the match .
Let us remember the Iranian team , remember this Iranian player who scored this goal -- Borhani .
The IOC warriors return to our motherland with hope .
I believe there will eventually be a day when we will -- avenge
[ ] A high school teacher teaching chemistry in the United Kingdom has appealed to the Department of Education to allow the views and theories that God created everything and intellectual life created the world to be introduced into school to be taught to students together along with Darwin 's theory of evolution , which has been dominating the scientific community since the 19 th century , and let students judge between right and wrong for themselves .
[ ] The long - standing policy of British Department of Education has been that the theories such as God 's creation are " unsuitable " for primary and secondary education .
[ ] Critics have pointed out that some scholars from non @-@ English countries actually have long mistranslated evolution theory and misinterpreted Darwin 's original intent , and the translation itself has a natural development from low to high level , a falsehood with almost religious bearings .
[ ] Also some Western scholars - such as paleontologists and archaeologists from the United Kingdom , France , and Germany in the 19 th and 20 th centuries - have long made use of the distorted theory of evolution and social Darwinism derived from the argument to attempt to prove their point that certain races are more advanced than others .

The Three Gorges project on the Yangtze River has recently introduced the first foreign capital .
The loan , a sum of 12.5 million US dollars , is an export credit provided to the Three Gorges project by the Canadian government , which will be used mainly for the management system of the Three Gorges project .
The project management system of the Three Gorges project will introduce scientific management methods and advanced computer technology of the MAI Corp. of Canada , which uses the project database management system as the core component in its control and management of the whole process of designing , planning , contracting , financing , goods and materials , equipment , construction and installation of each subproject of the Three Gorges project .
In October of 1995 , Youmei Lu , the general manager of the Three Gorges Project Development Corporation of China , went to Canada to sign the related business contracts .
This export credit project is entrusted to the Bank of China as the acting bank , and its commercial agent is the China Electronics Import and Export Corporation .
On February 28 th , the Three Gorges Branch of the Bank of China signed the agreement contract with the Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development Corporation of China to transfer the loan of the project .

This afternoon the Myanmaran and Thai governments signed an agreement on border trade between their two countries here .
Banharn Silpa - Archa , prime minister of Thailand , who arrived at Myanmar this morning to pay a visit , and Than Shwe , chairman of the State Law and Order Restoration Council and prime minister of Myanmaran government , chaired the signing ceremony .
Tonji , minister of the Myanmaran Ministry of Trade , and Gerson Gersoncy , minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand , signed the agreement on behalf of each country respectively .
Since 1988 , Myanmar has signed border trade agreements with China , India and Bengal .
Myanmaran officials revealed that the total trade volume between Myanmar and Thailand exceeded 300 million US dollars in 1995 .
Banharn is the first prime minister of Thailand to visit Myanmar since the latter half of 1980 .
It is thought that the purpose of this visit is to improve and develop the relationship between the two countries , to strengthen bilateral economic and trade co @-@ operation and to expand Thailand 's investment in Myanmar .
Yesterday and today , the Myanmaran government reopened three main trading ports located in the border area of Myanmar and Thailand that were closed last year .

The Chinese branch of the American Chamber of Commerce recently dispatched a delegation made up of twenty - five people launching a month - long lobbying campaign in Washington directed at congress and the White House , asking them to continue to extend granting China most - favored - nation trading status .
The Chamber of Commerce delegates participating in this lobbying campaign come from many well - known in Washington , large American companies , such as Dow Jones , AT&T , IBM , Boeing , McDonald Douglas , General Electric , Westinghouse , Ford , and the Xian Ni Lei De Group , etc.
They split into five groups and altogether visited about 150 members of congress , congressional aides , and government officials , using their experience of investing in and managing enterprises in China to explain the necessity of extending giving China most - favored - nation trading status .
With the once - a - year deliberations by the American administration and congress concerning the question of China 's most - favored - nation trading status again approaching , American businesses in Washington are universally concerned that the disputes among America 's political parties in this big election year could make this question even more complicated , hence the organization of groups to carry out a lobbying campaign directed at them that is organized and is planned .
Zhen Wang , a businessman of Chinese descent who is representing the Guangzhou chapter of the American Chamber of Commerce and the Xian Ni Lei De Group and is participating in the lobbying team , said to this reporter that , as a follow - up action to this lobbying effort , he prepared to mobilize tens of thousands of distributors who belong to the company to write to their local congressional representatives to support extending China 's most - favored - nation trading status .
The head of the Guangdong branch of the American Chamber of Commerce , the attorney Yonghua Kang , said the Clinton administration had already demonstrated that it wanted to extend China 's most - favored - nation trading status and because of this , the focus of this round of lobbying was those members of congress who are more conservative .

On the occasion of the 30 th anniversary of the establishment of ASEAN , the heads of the nine ASEAN countries and the heads of China , Japan and South Korea held an informal meeting in Kuala Lumpur , capital of Malaysia , on the 15 th .
The next day , the heads of China , Japan and South Korea held informal meetings again with the heads of the ASEAN countries separately .
This informal meeting of heads of Eastern Asian countries , the first time in history , is a good start .
After the end of the cold war , ASEAN confronted new international and regional situations and comprehensively adjusted its development strategy and foreign relations strategy , and increasingly became a cooperative organization in the southeast Asia region based on economic cooperation and integrating politics , economy and security .
ASEAN , with China , Japan and South Korea , strengthened their cooperation and jointly planned development , becoming a force that holds the balance .
Therefore , the holding of the informal meeting of heads of the countries in eastern Asia possesses important significance in promoting cooperation between all countries , in safeguarding regional and global security , and in accelerating the development towards world multi @-@ polarization .
The development of countries can not be separated from the region , and that of the region can not be separated from the globe .
Discarding old concepts and establishing new international political and economic orders conforms with the main trend of the times in which people of all countries demand peace , request development , seek stability and promote cooperation .
To correctly understand the relationship between economic development , political stability , social harmony and national security , to diligently promote all countries , regions and the whole world to travel on the road of peaceful development , to jointly discuss east Asian economic cooperation in the 21 st century and forecasting the future development of eastern Asia are subjects being discussed at this informal meeting of heads of state in eastern Asia .
Peace is a precondition to economic development .
Without a peaceful environment , any construction undertaking would be impossible to discuss .
Only when long - term peace is realized can the realization of sustained development be possible .
Therefore it is necessary to breed a new kind of security concept and to seek new methods to safeguard peace .
To establish relations between countries on the basis of the five principles , namely mutual respect of sovereignty and integrity of territory , non @-@ aggression , non @-@ interference in internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence , is the political basis and precondition for global and regional security .
That all countries strengthen their mutual benefits and cooperation in the field of economy , open up to each other , eliminate inequalities and discriminatory policies in economic and trade transactions , gradually narrow the development gaps between countries and strive for joint prosperity is the economic basis for global and regional security .
That all countries promote mutual understanding and trust through dialogue and cooperation , and promise to settle disputes and conflicts between countries in peaceful ways is a realistic way to ensure peace and security .
This year some countries in eastern Asia encountered financial turmoil and have had some difficulties in their economic development , but the economic basis of east Asian countries is still good and advantageous factors for economic development still exist .
In the course of this meeting , leaders of east Asian countries unanimously supported the suggestion to expand local trade and investment .
It is believed that after reviewing experience and implementing proper adjustments , the economy of eastern Asia will definitely continue to move forward in development .
The east Asian countries are not entirely without conflicts and disputes .
But in order to safeguard fundamental benefits to the people of all east Asian countries , and to promote the lofty cause of peace and development for mankind , we must progressively strengthen the east Asian cooperation .
Chairman Zemin Jiang solemnly elaborated on China 's stand at this meeting .
He emphatically pointed out that " We should uphold the principles of mutual respect , equal participation , mutual benefit , and co @-@ development ; we should strengthen cooperation in economy and technology , especially in the field of new high level technology , and establish reasonable regional economic structures , and form a mode of economic cooperation on the basis of learning from others ' strengths and offsetting others ' weaknesses , and mutual benefiting from advantages , balancing interests , and practicing non @-@ exclusiveness and non @-@ discrimination ; and we should strengthen trust , broaden common understanding , seek common points while maintaining differences , and resolve disputes appropriately through friendly dialogue and consultation to guarantee the region 's peace and stability . "
Everything is difficult at the very beginning .
With this good start , people have good reason to believe that the coordination and cooperation between east Asian countries will certainly show more hopeful prospects in the near future .

The special administrative region of Hong Kong maintained a good phase of prosperity and stabilization .
Qichen Qian said that we were always fully confident of Hong Kong 's prospects .
The central government and the people of the whole country always gave strong backing to the special region 's government and the compatriots of Hong Kong .
We believed that Hong Kong could continue to maintain its position as a free port and a center of international finance , trade and shipping , and to keep its long - term prosperity and stability .
Qichen Qian also made a comment on the fact that beginning this year , the Taiwan authorities continued to practice the so - called " practical diplomacy " , advocated that Taiwan was a so - called " independent sovereign state " , and actively set up obstacles in the negotiations between both sides of the straits .
He said that accomplishing the complete unification of the motherland was the common wish of all the Chinese people throughout the country and abroad .
Since Hong Kong 's return to the motherland , relations between both sides of the straits has drawn greater attention .
But the development of the separatist trend on Taiwan has greatly hindering the process of peaceful reunification .
We hope Taiwanese authorities conform to the historical development trends , and take opportunities to make active responses and wise choices for political negotiations between both sides of the Straits .

After the successful implementation of a " soft landing " , the rumbling train of China 's economy is running forward smoothly at high speed .
" Proper , quick and stable " growth will become the main theme of this year 's economic development .
Official authorities revealed that this year the Chinese government determined that the economic growth rate was 8 % and price levels will be controlled within 3 % .
This means that the whole economic operation situation will maintain a healthy pattern of " high growth and low inflation " .
People in economic circles seem to be more optimistic about the economic outlook .
The growth rate , predicted by concerned experts of the State Planning Commission , the Statistical Bureau and the China Academy of Social Sciences , is mostly 1 to 2 percentage points higher than governmental plans .
Of course , to a relatively large extent , this depends on aggregate control of using monetary policy as a primary means , or in other words , under the major premises of general tightening , how financial control should timely and reasonably conduct fine tuning .
Moreover , the impact of Southeast Asia 's financial crisis should not be underestimated .
On the part of the government , the keynote of a moderately tight macro @-@ economic policy will not be changed .
The key of the current economy is not striving for a higher growth rate , but is adjusting structures and increasing benefits so as to make macro controls which were implemented from the second half year of 1993 obtain greater achievements and push the national economy onto a road of constant , rapid and healthy development .
Actually , as main obstacles that restrained economic growth in the past several years -- inflation and the " bottleneck " of basic industries have all been evidently relieved and the macro @-@ economic situation tends to loosen , China 's economic development is in a relatively favorable period .
This year , China plans to create an effective pulling force to economic growth through maintaining a moderate and stable growth of investment , consumption and exports .
Fixed assets investments will grow by 10 % this year , total volumes of retail sales of social consumer products by 10 % and export growth by 8 % .
At the same time , the financial deficit will be reduced by 10 billion yuan .
After bidding farewell to the age of " the shortage economy " , relations between commodity 's supply and demand have changed from a " buyers ' market " to an integrated " sellers ' market " and competition will be intensified .
Hence , activating the consumer market , especially the wide rural market , cultivating consumer hotspots and new economic growth points appear to be particularly urgent .
Along with comprehensively implementing hardship relief measures taken towards large and medium - sized State owned enterprises , the pace of State owned enterprise reforms will be accelerated greatly , the dynamics of bankruptcies , mergers and assets restructuring will be strengthened , and enterprise deficits are estimated to decrease by 20 % and a number of competitive large and medium - sized State owned enterprises will gradually form .
However , the large amount of worker layoffs that will accompany this will cause unemployment pressure to gradually increase .
China has determined to appropriately place laid - off workers and to strive to control the unemployment rate to within 3.5 % through implementation of a large scale " re @-@ employment " project .
According to estimates , after three years in a row of bumper harvests , if this year 's measures are effective , agriculture still has hope of achieving a good harvest .
Agriculture 's increasing production and peasants ' increasing revenues will create favorable conditions for inhibiting commodity prices and realizing the target of steady economic development .
Currently , the degree of dependence on the outside of China 's economy has reached 42 % , and the space of utilizing overseas markets and resources is in the process of expanding , but is more easily subject to the influences of the international environment .
Under the circumstances of a relative steady domestic demand , the pulling effect of the trend of foreign trade towards economic development is more striking .
Taking all factors as a whole , this year 's amount of foreign trade will be increased steadily , the import will be increased and the increasing speed of the export will be somewhat slowed down .
People in economic circles said that China should adopt positive and steady measures to solve outstanding problems in economic operations , and special attention should be given to clear up bad assets in time and strengthen financial risk prevention .
Forecasting the Year of the Tiger , although China 's economic train will have ups and downs , as long as adjusted and controlled measures are at the right time and appropriate , it is believed that the train will move steadily along the preset track .

Information from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic said that , after high - speed development in previous years , China 's foreign investment attracting has entered an adjustment period .
Statistic figures show that , from January to November in 1997 , the number and contract sum of recently approved foreign investment projects decreased by 15.39 % and 33.52 % respectively over the same period last year , the amount of average foreign investment per project decreased 21.33 % over the same period last year , and the proportion of industrial projects in recently approved projects also decreased by 5.4 % .
Since reform and opening up to the outside world , China has been promoting attracting foreign investment even more as an important part of the basic national policy of opening up , the past five years have been five years when foreign merchants ' investments grew fastest , and foreign investments have stepped into the majority of fields of China 's national economy .
The amount of foreign investment actually utilized by China has been increasing in successive years , creating an historical high in 1997 , and a number of projects with particularly intensified technologies and funds have appeared .
On the other hand , since 1994 and 1995 , the number of recently approved foreign investment projects and the contract sum has been continually decreasing , which will directly affect China 's foreign investment attraction growth rate in the period to come .
Experts concerned pointed out that , after high - speed development in previous years , decelerating of the rate of China attracting foreign investment was normal .
However , at the beginning of this year , concerned parties announced that , for projects that had foreign invested , and which were in fields encouraged by China such as the new , high technology industry , infrastructure , etc. , the country would implement certain preferential taxation policies .
According to estimates , these policies would attract more foreign companies to invest in China .

Kazuo Nakamura , Director of Research at Japan 's Dai - Ichi Kangyo Bank , said here today that the real growth rate of the world economy in 1998 will be about 3 % .
Kazuo Nakamura , at a public lecture jointly organized by Beijing 's Wu Jia Economic Consulting Company , Ltd. and Japan 's Dai - Ichi Kangyo Bank , made a report concerning the new year 's world economic and financial situation .
After he reviewed the world economic and financial situation of '@ 97 , he said that due to the economic growth in Asia , including Japan , further slowing down , the economic growth of America , even though its current economic activity is relatively good , and of other countries will also feel a very large effect .
Compared with the rapid growth of the past , the world economy has entered a period of adjustment .
He forecast that the real growth rate for the world economy this year would fall from the 3.9 % of '@ 97 down to 3 % .
Nakamura thought that the rate of economic growth of Asia 's countries and regions , with Korea and Thailand being the most prominent , would slide downward to a large extent .
But , he said , for these countries the currencies already have devalued to a great degree , exports have recovered , and imports could decrease .
Because of this , he expected that their economies would slip downward to the lowest point in the next half year .
He estimated that the rate of economic growth in ASEAN would be about 4.5 percent .
Nakamura said that the Japanese economy exhibited negative growth in the year '@ 97 , and that in '@ 98 , if it did n't adopt good economic policies , the economy would continue to be in negative growth .
He estimated it would be negative 0.5 percent , plus or minus .
He said further that China 's economic growth would also slow in speed , feeling the effects of the economies of Japan and Asia being depressed and of the devaluation of these countries ' currencies .
But because China 's usual income and expenditures show a favorable balance , and in addition it has over 100 billion US dollars in foreign exchange reserves , it is n't likely to sink into the crisis like the other Asian nations .

According to what has been reported in the Soviet " Science and Life " magazine , biologists in Moscow have discovered that a mold element in the cells of plants can not only control the propagation of plasmodium in mosquitoes , but can also kill mosquitoes .
This method will not pollute the environment .
Biologists mixed a mold element in the cells of plants with pearl powder to produce a granulated drug .
This kind of drug can slowly discharge the mold element from the cells of plants in water .
When mosquitoes feed , they suck the mold element from the cells of plants into their bodies .
Experiments have shown that adopting this method can reduce the chances of mosquitoes transmitting malaria down to 1 / 70 th to 1 / 80 th of the original ratio .

Today , the " Jerusalem Post " quoted the words of Shawel , director of the Administrative Office of the Israeli Foreign Ministry who is now visiting the US as saying that the World Bank has decided to provide 250 million US dollars of aid to Palestinian Autonomous Authorities before the end of 1994 .
This decision broke the impasse between donor countries and Palestinian Autonomous Authorities that had lasted for nearly one year .
At the international meeting on aiding Palestinian autonomy which was held in Washington on October 1 st of last year , donor countries pledged to provide 2.4 billion US dollars of development aid within 5 years , of which 750 million US dollars would be appropriated in the first year .
But donor countries claimed that the Palestinian autonomous region lacks necessary mechanisms for handling the aid and accounting items and therefore refused to completely fulfill this promise .
Shawel said that although the US and the World Bank are currently not completely satisfied with Palestinian accounting work , they have still agreed to pay a portion of the funds as soon as possible .
Arafat , chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestinian Liberation Organization , and other Palestinian leaders have been criticizing the donor countries for not being able to keep their promise to make sure the money aid is completely in place and on time .
It is predicted that Shashe , the PLO 's chief negotiations representative , and Rosechird , Israel 's chief negotiations representative , will go to Washington to specifically negotiate and determine the aid issues with the US and the World Bank .

Premier Peng Li delivered a written speech to welcome the International Population and Development Congress .
He thinks that the Chinese government 's guidelines of planning , strategizing and implementation of the population problem and socioeconomic problems as one is correct , effective in its implementation , and successful .
Peng Li said that in the beginning of September of this year , the United Nations would hold the International Population and Development Congress in Cairo with the theme of " population , continuous economic growth and continuous development " .
This shows that the international community has increasingly recognized that population and development are inseparable , and prepare to adopt actions together .
He feels that this Congress has important meaning , and the Chinese government has given it high level attention and will be sending a delegation to attend the Congress .
Peng Li said China was the most populous developing country in the world .
The Chinese government included the population problem into the overall planning of the national economy and its social development , always emphasizing that population growth and economic development need to fit together , and be coordinated with resource utilization and environmental protection .
In light of China 's basic national condition , the Chinese government has determined planned parenthood and environmental protection as two basic national policies , implementing a population policy and planned parenthood program that suits China 's actual needs .
At the same time , the Chinese government also formulated a series of important policies and measures to realize continuous development , such as the protection of women 's legal rights and benefits , the promotion of equality among men and women , the forceful development of healthcare for women and children , the zealous elimination of poverty , and protecting the environment .
Presently , the Chinese economy is continuously growing , society is stable and united , people 's livelihood are continuously improving , and the population birth rate and the natural population growth rate has dropped to a lower level .
Peng Li said the population problem was one of the major problems currently faced by the international community .
Due to differences in country 's situations , differences in economic development levels , cultural backgrounds , historical traditions , and social systems , each country should formulate suitable , effective population policies according to the actual situation of the native country .
This is the sovereignty of each country and it should receive full respect .
He said China was in a critical period of building up a socialist market economy system and increasing the pace of its modernization build - up , but a huge , overwhelming growth in population was still restraining the social and economic development , affecting the further improvement of the living standard of the people , and has also brought about heavy pressure on the natural resources and the natural environment .
Because of this , for a fairly long period of time , at the same time as forcefully developing the economy , China will continue to pay close attention to doing well the work of family planning .
The Chinese government strongly believes that , the resolution of China 's population problem is not just being responsible for the prosperity of the Chinese race and the happiness of future generations , but is also an important contribution in stabilizing the world 's population .
For this , the Chinese government views with extreme importance and actively participates in international population activities , and sincerely hopes that the international community will adopt a stand of realistic resolution of population and development problems , seeking similarities while accommodating differences , co @-@ operating closely to strive hard together towards a stable world population to create a beautiful future !
